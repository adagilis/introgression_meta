Qin, C; Guo, YR; Wu, JZ; Wang, L; Traw, MB; Zhang, YC	Comparative population genomic analysis provides insights into breeding of modern indica rice in China	GENE	Indica improvement; Population structure; Haplotype block; Artificial selection; Genomic analysis	Comparative genomic analysis within Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) populations has greatly enriched our knowledge regarding rice domestication and the divergence of the indica and japonica subspecies, while study on genomic regions associated with improvement within the indica subspecies is still limited. Here, through combined investigation of 2,429 indica cultivar genomes from public sequencing projects, we depict the improvement of modern indica rice in China. We identify three subgroups within indica populations: two geographically distinct, historical subgroups indica I (Ind_I) and indica III (Ind_III) and a modern subgroup indica II (Ind_II). The modern indica subgroup Ind_II shows admixture of the other two subgroups and enrichment of alleles that had been low-frequency in the other two subgroups. The Chinese indica cultivars exhibit a strong subgroup component change from Ind_I to Ind_II in the 1980s. Through haplotype-based comparative analysis, we detect 187 regions associated with separation of Ind_II compared to Ind_I or Ind_III. Within those regions we find strong representation of beneficial agricultural production-related alleles in Ind_II and a positive correlation between grain yield and number of differentiated haplotypes. Phenotypic features of long and slender grain, small tiller angle and decreased flowering time were detected for Ind_II. Through haplotype-based comparative analysis between rice subpopulations and subspecies, we find differentiated haplotypes not only from indica itself but also from japonica and aus, suggesting that introgression from other rice sub-populations has substantially contributed to modern indica rice breeds. These results help clarify the evolutionary landscape of modern indica rice in China and provide useful targets for future improvement.

This potentially confounds phylogenetic inference methods that aim to represent evolution as a strictly bifurcating tree. We apply a phylotranscriptomic approach to study the evolutionary history of, and test for inter-lineage introgression in the Salamandridae, a Holarctic salamanders group of interest in studies of toxicity and aposematism, courtship behavior, and molecular evolution. Although the relationships between the 21 currently recognized salamandrid genera have been the subject of numerous molecular phylogenetic studies, some branches have remained controversial and sometimes affected by discordances between mitochondrial vs. nuclear trees. To resolve the phylogeny of this family, and understand the source of mitonuclear discordance, we generated new transcriptomic (RNAseq) data for 20 salamandrids and used these along with published data, including 28 mitochondrial genomes, to obtain a comprehensive nuclear and mitochondrial perspective on salamandrid evolution. Our final phylotranscriptomic data set included 5455 gene alignments for 40 species representing 17 of the 21 salamandrid genera. Using concatenation and species-tree phylogenetic methods, we find (1) Salamandrina sister to the clade of the True Salamanders (consisting of Chioglossa, Mertensiella, Lyciasalamandra, and Salamandra), (2) Ichthyosaura sister to the Near Eastern genera Neurergus and Ommatotriton, (3) Triturus sister to Lissotriton, and (4) Cynops paraphyletic with respect to Paramesotriton and Pachytriton. Combining introgression tests and phylogenetic networks, we find evidence for introgression among taxa within the clades of Modern Asian Newts and Modern European Newts. However, we could not unambiguously identify the number, position, and direction of introgressive events. Combining evidence from nuclear gene analysis with the observed mito-nuclear phylogenetic discordances, we hypothesize a scenario with hybridization and mitochondrial capture among ancestral lineages of (1) Lissotriton into Ichthyosaura and (2) Triturus into Calotriton, plus introgression of nuclear genes from Triturus into Lissotriton. Furthermore, both mitochondrial capture and nuclear introgression may have occurred among lineages assigned to Cynops. More comprehensive genomic data will, in the future, allow testing this against alternative scenarios involving hybridization with other, extinct lineages of newts.

Bantam chicken, known as an exquisite form of dwarfism, has been used for crossbreeding to create corresponding dwarf counterparts for native fowls in the Dutch populations. Here, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of the bantam trait in Dutch chickens and reveal the underlying genetic causes, using whole-genome sequence data from matching pairs of bantam and normal-sized breeds. During the bantam-oriented crossbreeding, various bantam origins were used to introduce the bantam phenotype, and three major bantam sources were identified and clustered. The genome-wide association studies revealed multiple genetic variants and genes associated with bantam phenotype, including HMGA2 and PRDM16, genes involved in body growth and stature. The comparison of associated variants among studies illustrated differences related to divergent bantam origins, suggesting a clear heterogeneity among bantam breeds. We show that in neo-bantam breeds, the bantam-related regions underwent a strong haplotype introgression from the bantam source, outcompeting haplotypes from the normal-sized counterpart. The bantam heterogeneity is further confirmed by the presence of multiple haplotypes comprising associated alleles, which suggests the selection of the bantam phenotype is likely subject to a convergent direction across populations. Our study demonstrates that the diverse history of human-mediated crossbreeding has contributed to the complexity and heterogeneity of the bantam phenotype.

Ramirez-Ayala, LC; Rocha, D; Ramos-Onsins, SE; Leno-Colorado, J; Charles, M; Bouchez, O; Rodriguez-Valera, Y; Perez-Enciso, M; Ramayo-Caldas, Y	Whole-genome sequencing reveals insights into the adaptation of French Charolais cattle to Cuban tropical conditions	GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION		BackgroundIn the early 20th century, Cuban farmers imported Charolais cattle (CHFR) directly from France. These animals are now known as Chacuba (CHCU) and have become adapted to the rough environmental tropical conditions in Cuba. These conditions include long periods of drought and food shortage with extreme temperatures that European taurine cattle have difficulty coping with.ResultsIn this study, we used whole-genome sequence data from 12 CHCU individuals together with 60 whole-genome sequences from six additional taurine, indicus and crossed breeds to estimate the genetic diversity, structure and accurate ancestral origin of the CHCU animals. Although CHCU animals are assumed to form a closed population, the results of our admixture analysis indicate a limited introgression of Bos indicus. We used the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) approach to identify regions in the genome that may have had an important role in the adaptation of CHCU to tropical conditions. Putative selection events occurred in genomic regions with a high proportion of Bos indicus, but they were not sufficient to explain adaptation of CHCU to tropical conditions by Bos indicus introgression only. EHH suggested signals of potential adaptation in genomic windows that include genes of taurine origin involved in thermogenesis (ATP9A, GABBR1, PGR, PTPN1 and UCP1) and hair development (CCHCR1 and CDSN). Within these genes, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may have a functional impact and contribute to some of the observed phenotypic differences between CHCU and CHFR animals.ConclusionsWhole-genome data confirm that CHCU cattle are closely related to Charolais from France (CHFR) and Canada, but also reveal a limited introgression of Bos indicus genes in CHCU. We observed possible signals of recent adaptation to tropical conditions between CHCU and CHFR founder populations, which were largely independent of the Bos indicus introgression. Finally, we report candidate genes and variants that may have a functional impact and explain some of the phenotypic differences observed between CHCU and CHFR cattle.

Rose, JP; Toledo, CAP; Lemmon, EM; Lemmon, AR; Sytsma, KJ	Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Widespread Nuclear and Plastid-Nuclear Discordance in the Flowering Plant Genus Polemonium (Polemoniaceae) Suggests Widespread Historical Gene Flow Despite Limited Nuclear Signal	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	Cyto-nuclear discordance; genomic discordance; phylogenetic networks; plastid capture; Polemoniaceae; Polemonium; reticulations	Phylogenomic data from a rapidly increasing number of studies provide new evidence for resolving relationships in recently radiated clades, but they also pose new challenges for inferring evolutionary histories. Most existing methods for reconstructing phylogenetic hypotheses rely solely on algorithms that only consider incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) as a cause of intra- or intergenomic discordance. Here, we utilize a variety of methods, including those to infer phylogenetic networks, to account for both ILS and introgression as a cause for nuclear and cytoplasmic-nuclear discordance using phylogenomic data from the recently radiated flowering plant genus Polemonium (Polemoniaceae), an ecologically diverse genus in Western North America with known and suspected gene flow between species. We find evidence for widespread discordance among nuclear loci that can be explained by both ILS and reticulate evolution in the evolutionary history of Polemonium. Furthermore, the histories of organellar genomes show strong discordance with the inferred species tree from the nuclear genome. Discordance between the nuclear and plastid genome is not completely explained by ILS, and only one case of discordance is explained by detected introgression events. Our results suggest that multiple processes have been involved in the evolutionary history of Polemonium and that the plastid genome does not accurately reflect species relationships. We discuss several potential causes for this cytoplasmic-nuclear discordance, which emerging evidence suggests is more widespread across the Tree of Life than previously thought.

Ravinet, M; Kume, M; Ishikawa, A; Kitano, J	Patterns of genomic divergence and introgression between Japanese stickleback species with overlapping breeding habitats	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY		With only a few absolute geographic barriers in marine environments, the factors maintaining reproductive isolation among marine organisms remain elusive. However, spatial structuring in breeding habitat can contribute to reproductive isolation. This is particularly important for marine organisms that migrate to use fresh- or brackish water environments to breed. The Japanese Gasterosteus stickleback species, the Pacific Ocean three-spined stickleback (G. aculeatus) and the Japan Sea stickleback (G. nipponicus) overwinter in the sea, but migrate to rivers for spawning. Although they co-occur at several locations across the Japanese islands, they are reproductively isolated. Our previous studies in Bekanbeushi River showed that the Japan Sea stickleback spawns in the estuary, while the Pacific Ocean stickleback mainly spawns further upstream in freshwater. Overall genomic divergence was very high with many interspersed regions of introgression. Here, we investigated genomic divergence and introgression between the sympatric species in the much shorter Tokotan River, where they share spawning sites. The levels of genome-wide divergence were reduced and introgression was increased, suggesting that habitat isolation substantially contributes to a reduction in gene flow. We also found that genomic regions of introgression were largely shared between the two systems. Furthermore, some regions of introgression were located near loci with a heterozygote advantage for juvenile survival. Taken together, introgression may be partially driven by adaptation in this system. Although, the two species remain clearly genetically differentiated. Regions with low recombination rates showed especially low introgression. Speciation reversal is therefore likely prevented by barriers other than habitat isolation.

In recent species radiations the sharing of genetic variation across porous species boundaries can facilitate adaptation to new environments and generate novel phenotypes, which may contribute to further diversification. Most Anopheles mosquito species that are of major importance as human malaria vectors have evolved within recent and rapid radiations of largely nonvector species. Here, we focus on one of the most medically important yet understudied anopheline radiations, the Afrotropical Anopheles funestus complex (AFC), to investigate the role of introgression in its diversification and the possible link between introgression and vector potential. The AFC comprises at least seven morphologically similar species, yet only An. funestus sensu stricto is a highly efficient malaria vector with a pan-African distribution. Based on de novo genome assemblies and additional whole-genome resequencing, we use phylogenomic and population genomic analyses to establish species relationships. We show that extensive interspecific gene flow involving multiple species pairs has shaped the evolutionary history of the AFC since its diversification. The most recent introgression event involved a massive and asymmetrical movement of genes from a distantly related AFC lineage into An. funestus, an event that predated and plausibly facilitated its subsequent dramatic geographic range expansion across most of tropical Africa. We propose that introgression may be a common mechanism facilitating adaptation to new environments and enhancing vectorial capacity in Anopheles mosquitoes.

However, its origin remains unclear. In this study, we resequenced 336 accessions of white Guinea yam and compared them with the sequences of wild Dioscorea species using an improved reference genome sequence of D. rotundata. In contrast to a previous study suggesting that D. rotundata originated from a subgroup of Dioscorea praehensilis, our results suggest a hybrid origin of white Guinea yam from crosses between the wild rainforest species D. praehensilis and the savannah-adapted species Dioscorea abyssinica. We identified a greater genomic contribution from D. abyssinica in the sex chromosome of Guinea yam and extensive introgression around the SWEETIE gene. Our findings point to a complex domestication scenario for Guinea yam and highlight the importance of wild species as gene donors for improving this crop through molecular breeding.

Lopez-Delgado, J; van Riemsdijk, I; Arntzen, JW	Tracing species replacement in Iberian marbled newts	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	amphibians; enclave; hybridization; introgression; secondary contact; Triturus	Secondary contact between closely related species can lead to the formation of hybrid zones, allowing for interspecific gene flow. Hybrid zone movement can take place if one of the species possesses a competitive advantage over the other, ultimately resulting in species replacement. Such hybrid zone displacement is predicted to leave a genomic footprint across the landscape in the form of asymmetric gene flow (or introgression) of selectively neutral alleles from the displaced to the advancing species. Hybrid zone movement has been suggested for marbled newts in the Iberian Peninsula, supported by asymmetric gene flow and a distribution relict (i.e., an enclave) of Triturus marmoratus in the range of T. pygmaeus. We developed a panel of nuclear and mitochondrial SNP markers to test for the presence of a T. marmoratus genomic footprint in the Lisbon peninsula, south of the enclave. We found no additional populations of T. marmoratus. Analysis with the software Structure showed no genetic traces of T. marmoratus in T. pygmaeus. A principal component analysis showed some variation within the local T. pygmaeus, but it is unclear if this represents introgression from T. marmoratus. The results may be explained by (a) species replacement without introgressive hybridization and (b) displacement with hybridization followed by the near-complete erosion of the footprint by purifying selection. We predict that testing for a genomic footprint north of the reported enclave would confirm that species replacement in these marbled newts occurred with hybridization.

Using genomic markers combined with estimation of individual ancestries, assignment tests, spatial ecology, and demographic modeling, we (i) characterized the contemporary population structure, (ii) assessed the influence of space, fishing depth, and sampling years on contemporary distribution, and (iii) reconstructed the speciation history of two cryptic redfish species, Sebastes mentella and S. fasciatus. We genotyped 860 individuals in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean using 24,603 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results confirmed the clear genetic distinctiveness of the two species and identified three ecotypes within S. mentella and five populations in S. fasciatus. Multivariate analyses highlighted the influence of spatial distribution and depth on the overall genomic variation, while demographic modeling revealed that secondary contact models best explained inter- and intragenomic divergence. These species, ecotypes, and populations can be considered as a rare and wide continuum of genomic divergence in the marine environment. This acquired knowledge pertaining to the evolutionary processes driving population divergence and reproductive isolation will help optimizing the assessment of demographic units and possibly to refine fishery management units.

Graham, CF; Eberts, RL; Goncin, U; Somers, CM	Spontaneous hybridization and introgression between walleye (Sander vitreus) and sauger (Sander canadensis) in two large reservoirs: Insights from genotyping by sequencing	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	genotyping by sequencing; hybridization; introgression; sauger; walleye	Anthropogenic activities may facilitate undesirable hybridization and genomic introgression between fish species. Walleye (Sander vitreus) and sauger (Sander canadensis) are economically valuable freshwater species that can spontaneously hybridize in areas of sympatry. Levels of genomic introgression between walleye and sauger may be increased by modifications to waterbodies (e.g., reservoir development) and inadvertent propagation of hybrids in stocking programs. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to examine 217 fish from two large reservoirs with mixed populations of walleye and sauger in Saskatchewan, Canada (Lake Diefenbaker, Tobin Lake). Analyses with 20,038 (r90) and 478 (r100) single nucleotide polymorphisms clearly resolved walleye and sauger, and classified hybrids with high confidence. F-1, F-2, and multigeneration hybrids were detected in Lake Diefenbaker, indicating potentially high levels of genomic introgression. In contrast, only F-1 hybrids were detected in Tobin Lake. Field classification of fish was unreliable; 7% of fish were misidentified based on broad species categories. Important for activities such as brood stock selection, 12 of 173 (7%) fish field identified as pure walleye, and one of 24 (4%) identified as pure sauger were actually hybrids. In addition, two of 15 (13%) field-identified hybrids were actually pure walleye or sauger. We conclude that hybridization and introgression are occurring in Saskatchewan reservoirs and that caution is warranted when using these populations in stocking programs. GBS offers a powerful and flexible tool for examining hybridization without preidentification of informative loci, eliminating some of the key challenges associated with other marker types.

Popovic, I; Bierne, N; Gaiti, F; Tanurdzic, M; Riginos, C	Pre-introduction introgression contributes to parallel differentiation and contrasting hybridization outcomes between invasive and native marine mussels	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	genetic differentiation; hybrid zone; introgression; invasive species; Mytilus; parallel evolution	Non-native species experience novel selection pressures in introduced environments and may interbreed with native lineages. Species introductions therefore provide opportunities to investigate repeated patterns of adaptation and introgression across replicated contact zones. Here, we investigate genetic parallelism between multiple introduced populations of the invasive marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, in the absence (South Africa and California) and presence of hybridization with a native congener (Mytilus planulatus in Batemans Bay and Sydney Harbour, Australia). Repeatability in post-introduction differentiation from native-range populations varied between genetically distinct Atlantic and Mediterranean lineages, with Atlantic-derived introductions displaying high differentiation (maxF(ST) > 0.4) and parallelism at outlier loci. Identification of long noncoding RNA transcripts (lncRNA) additionally allowed us to clarify that parallel responses are largely limited to protein-coding loci, with lncRNAs likely evolving under evolutionary constraints. Comparisons of independent hybrid zones revealed differential introgression most strongly in Batemans Bay, with an excess of M. galloprovincialis ancestry and resistance to introgression at loci differentiating parental lineages (M. planulatus and Atlantic M. galloprovincialis). Additionally, contigs putatively introgressed with divergent alleles from a closely related species, Mytilus edulis, showed stronger introgression asymmetries compared with genome-wide trends and also diverged in parallel in both Atlantic-derived introductions. These results suggest that divergent demographic histories experienced by introduced lineages, including pre-introduction introgression, influence contemporary admixture dynamics. Our findings build on previous investigations reporting contributions of historical introgression to intrinsic reproductive architectures shared between marine lineages and illustrate that interspecific introgression history can shape differentiation between colonizing populations and their hybridization with native congeners.

Liu, XF; Li, ZH; Yan, YB; Li, Y; Wu, H; Pei, J; Yan, P; Yang, RL; Guo, X; Lan, XY	Selection and introgression facilitated the adaptation of Chinese native endangered cattle in extreme environments	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	adaptation; cattle; endangered; extreme environment; introgression; SNPs	Although persistent efforts have identified and characterized a few candidate genes and related biological processes with potential functions in the adaptation of many species to extreme environments, few works have been conducted to determine the genomic basis of adaptation in endangered livestock breeds that have been living in extreme conditions for more than thousands of years. To fill this gap, we sequenced the whole genomes of nine individuals from three Chinese native endangered cattle breeds that are living in high-altitude or arid environments. Phylogenetic and evolutionary history analyses of these three and other six breeds showed that the genetic structure of the cattle populations is primarily related to geographic location. Interestingly, we identified pervasive introgression from the yak to Zhangmu cattle (ZMC) that cover several genes (e.g., NOS2, EGLN1 and EPAS1) involved in the hypoxia response and previously identified as positive selection genes in other species, which suggested that the adaptive introgression from yak may have contributed to the adaptation of ZMC to high-altitude environments. In addition, by contrasting the breeds in opposite living conditions, we revealed a set of candidate genes with various functions from hypoxia response, water metabolism, immune response and body shape change to embryo development and skeletal system development, etc., that may be related to high-altitude or arid adaptation. Our research provides new insights into the recovery and adaptation of endangered native cattle and other species in extreme environments and valuable resources for future research on animal husbandry to cope with climate change.

Gao, YD; Harris, AJ; Li, HC; Gao, XF	Hybrid Speciation and Introgression Both Underlie the Genetic Structures and Evolutionary Relationships of Three Morphologically Distinct Species of Lilium (Liliaceae) Forming a Hybrid Zone Along an Elevational Gradient	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	divergence with gene flow; introgression; species boundary; Lilium; Hengduan Mountains; Southwestern China; Nomocharis; hybridzation	We studied hybrid interactions of Lilium meleagrinum, Lilium gongshanense, and Lilium saluenense using an integrative approach combining population genetics, fieldwork, and phenological research. These three species occur along an elevational gradient, with L. meleagrinum occurring at lower elevations, L. saluenense at higher elevations, and L. gongshanense between them. The species show strong morphological differentiation despite there being no clear environmental barriers to gene flow among them. Lilium gongshanense is likely to have a hybrid origin based on our prior work, but its progenitors remain uncertain. We sought to determine whether gene flow occurs among these three parapatric species, and, if so, whether L. gongshanense is a hybrid of L. meleagrinum and/or L. saluenense. We analyzed data from multiple chloroplast genes and spacers, nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and 18 nuclear Expressed Sequence Tag-Simple Sequence Repeat (EST-SSR) microsatellites for accessions of the three species representing dense population-level sampling. We also inferred phenology by examining species in the field and using herbarium specimens. We found that there are only two types of chloroplast genomes shared among the three species and that L. gongshanense forms two distinct groups with closest links to other species of Lilium based on ITS. Taken together, L. gongshanense is unlikely to be a hybrid species resulting from a cross between L. meleagrinum and L. saluenense, but gene flow is occurring among the three species. The gene flow is likely to be rare according to evidence from all molecular datasets, and this is corroborated by detection of only one putative hybrid individual in the field and asynchronous phenology. We suspect that the rarity of hybridization events among the species facilitates their continued genetic separation.

The northernmost occurrence of T. pygmaeus genetic material was in a T. marmoratus population north of the Vouga river estuary. This suggested the past presence of a hybrid zone, possibly coinciding with a natural river outlet at ca. 1200 A.D. Since 1808, the species contact may have moved back south to a by then completed, man-made Vouga channel. We also found evidence for a T. marmoratus genomic footprint in T. pygmaeus from the Serra de Sintra, near Lisbon. In combination with a previously reported southern, relic occurrence of T. marmoratus in between both areas, the data point to the superseding with hybridization of T. marmoratus by T. pygmaeus. We estimate that the species hybrid zone has moved along the Atlantic coast over a distance of ca. 215 km.

Linan, AG; Lowry, PP; Miller, AJ; Schatz, GE; Sevathian, JC; Edwards, CE	RAD-sequencing reveals patterns of diversification and hybridization, and the accumulation of reproductive isolation in a clade of partially sympatric, tropical island trees	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Diospyros; hybridization; Mascarenes; reproductive isolation; species limits; tropical tree	A common pattern observed in temperate tree clades is that species are often morphologically distinct and partially interfertile but maintain species cohesion despite ongoing hybridization where ranges overlap. Although closely related species commonly occur in sympatry in tropical ecosystems, little is known about patterns of hybridization within a clade over time, and the implications of this hybridization for the maintenance of species boundaries. In this study, we focused on a clade of sympatric trees in the genus Diospyros in the Mascarene islands and investigated whether species are genetically distinct, whether they hybridize, and how patterns of hybridization are related to the time since divergence among species. We sampled multiple populations from each of 12 Mascarene Diospyros species, generated genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using 2bRADseq, and conducted population genomic and phylogenomic analyses. We found that Mascarene Diospyros species diverged millions of years ago and are today largely genetically distinct from one another. Although hybridization was observed between closely related species belonging to the same subclade, more distantly related species showed little evidence of interspecific hybridization. Phylogenomic analyses also suggested that introgression has occurred during the evolutionary history of the clade. This suggests that, as diversification progressed, interspecific hybridization occurred among species, but became infrequent as lineages diverged from one another and evolved reproductive barriers. Species now coexist in partial sympatry, and experience limited hybridization between close relatives. Additional research is needed to better understand the role that introgression may have played in adaptation and diversification of Mascarene Diospyros, and its relevance for conservation.

Exceptions where >1 congeneric species use the same tissues reveal important insights into ecological factors underlying the origins and maintenance of diversity. Larvae of sunflower maggot flies in the genus Strauzia feed on plants in the family Asteraceae. Although Strauzia tend to be host specialists, some species specialize on the same hosts. To resolve the origins of host sharing among these specialist flies, we used reduced representation genomic sequencing to infer the first multilocus phylogeny of genus Strauzia. Our results show that Helianthus tuberosus and Helianthus grosseserratus each host three different Strauzia species and that the flies co-occurring on a host are not one another's closest relatives. Though this pattern implies that host sharing is most likely the result of host shifts, these may not all be host shifts in the conventional sense of an insect moving onto an entirely new plant. Many hosts of Strauzia belong to a clade of perennial sunflowers that arose 1-2 MYA and are noted for frequent introgression and hybrid speciation events. Our divergence time estimates for all of the Helianthus-associated Strauzia are within this same time window (<1 MYA), suggesting that rapid and recent adaptive introgression and speciation in Helianthus may have instigated the diversification of Strauzia, with some flies converging upon a single plant host after their respective ancestral host plants hybridized to form a new sunflower species.

Advances in genomics have expedited the improvement of several agriculturally important crops but similar efforts in wheat (Triticum spp.) have been more challenging. This is largely owing to the size and complexity of the wheat genome(1), and the lack of genome-assembly data for multiple wheat lines(2,3). Here we generated ten chromosome pseudomolecule and five scaffold assemblies of hexaploid wheat to explore the genomic diversity among wheat lines from global breeding programs. Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses(4,5). We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of Sm1(6), a gene associated with insect resistance. These genome assemblies will provide a basis for functional gene discovery and breeding to deliver the next generation of modern wheat cultivars.

Dufresnes, C; Suchan, T; Smirnov, NA; Denoel, M; Rosanov, JM; Litvinchuk, SN	Revisiting a speciation classic: Comparative analyses support sharp but leaky transitions between Bombina toads	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY	cline analyses; hybrid zone; hybridization; introgression; RAD&#8208; sequencing	Aim The amount of gene flow between parapatric species can be greatly variable depending on how species boundaries are maintained in respect to numerous genetic and ecological factors that affect the strength of reproductive isolation. We quantified this variability to understand its effect on the genetic integrity of a well-studied pair of hybridizing amphibians. Location Central and Eastern Europe. Taxa The fire- and yellow-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata. Methods We first complemented the mitochondrial phylogeography of European Bombina by barcoding additional populations and built MaxEnt species distribution models to identify the routes of post-glacial colonization that led to hybrid zone formation. Second, we targeted the areas of parapatry in Poland and Ukraine to assess nuclear admixture by population genetics (PCA, Bayesian clustering) of allozyme and genomic markers (RAD-seq). Third, we harvested the rich Bombina literature to thoroughly compare the extent of geographical introgression across 11 transitions altogether, using cline analyses when possible. Results We found sharp (2-11 km wide) but leaky transitions (geographically extensive traces of introgression) in all parapatric areas, either measured from a few allozymes or thousands of species-diagnostic SNPs, and irrespective of the intraspecific lineages involved or the relative ages since first contact. Main conclusion Bombina species are permeable to gene flow despite selection against hybrids that retards but cannot ultimately prevent putatively neutral introgression into the parental gene pools. Although local hybrid swarms face genetic assimilation, the species' integrities remain intact due to their large geographical ranges and ecological differentiation that enforces tight boundaries regardless of the biogeographical attributes of the contacts. Opposing the great variability of introgression patterns found between cryptic species, these results support that gene flow should not be viewed as a force of despeciation when reproductive isolation involves multiple intrinsic and extrinsic barriers.

A quantitative integration of behavioural characters, such as vocalizations, in studies on biotic differentiation has arisen more recently, and the relative importance of these different traits in the diversification process remains poorly understood. To provide a framework within which to interpret the evolutionary interplay between morphological and behavioural traits, we generated a draft genome of a cryptic Southeast Asian songbird, the limestone wren-babbler Napothera crispifrons. We resequenced whole genomes of multiple individuals of all three traditional subspecies and of a distinct leucistic population. We demonstrate strong genomic and mitochondrial divergence among all three taxa, pointing to the existence of three species-level lineages. Despite its great phenotypic distinctness, the leucistic population was characterized by shallow genomic differentiation from its neighbour, with only a few localized regions emerging as highly diverged. Quantitative bioacoustic analysis across multiple traits revealed deep differences especially between the two taxa characterized by limited plumage differentiation. Our study demonstrates that differentiation in these furtive songbirds has resulted in a complex mosaic of colour-based and bioacoustic differences among populations. Extreme colour differences can be anchored in few genomic loci and may therefore arise and subside rapidly.

Liu, Y; El-Kassaby, YA	Transcriptome-wide analysis of introgression-resistant regions reveals genetic divergence genes under positive selection in Populus trichocarpa	HEREDITY		Comparing gene expression patterns and genetic polymorphisms between populations is of central importance for understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Based on population-specific gene expression levels and allele frequency differences, we sought to identify population divergence (PD) genes across the introgression-resistant genomic regions of Populus trichocarpa. Genes containing highly diverged loci [i.e., genetic divergence (GD)] or showing expression divergence (ED) between populations were widely distributed in the genome and substantially enriched in functional categories related to stress responses, disease resistance, timing of flowering, cell cycle regulation, plant growth, and development. Nine genomic regions showing evidence of strong positive selection were overlapped with GD genes, which had significant differences between Oregon (a southernmost peripheral deme) and the other demes. However, we did not find evidence that genes under positive selection show an enrichment for ED. PD genes and genes under selection pertained to the same gene classes, such as SERINE/CYSTEINE PROTEASE, ABC TRANSPORTER, GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE and other transferases. Our analysis also revealed that GD genes were polymorphic within the species (41.9 +/- 3.66 biallelic variants per gene), as previously reported in herbaceous plants. By contrast, ED genes contained less genetic variants (10.73 +/- 1.14) and were likely highly expressed. In addition, we found that trans- rather than cis-acting variants considerably contribute to the evolution of >90% PD genes. Overall, this study elucidates that cohorts of PD genes agree with the general attributes of known speciation genes and GD genes will provide substrates for positive selection to operate on.

Callaby, R; Kelly, R; Mazeri, S; Egbe, F; Benedictus, L; Clark, E; Doeschl-Wilson, A; Bronsvoort, B; Salavati, M; Muwonge, A	Genetic Diversity of Cameroon Cattle and a Putative Genomic Map for Resistance to Bovine Tuberculosis	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS	susceptibility; admixture; Bos indicus; Cameroon; bovine tuberculosis	Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a livestock disease of global economic and public health importance. There are currently no effective vaccines available for livestock and so control relies on animal level surveillance and pasteurization of dairy products. A new alternative control approach is to exploit the genetic variability of the host; recent studies have demonstrated that breeding European taurine cattle, such as Holsteins for increased resistance to bTB is feasible. The utility of such an approach is still unknown for African cattle populations. This study aims to assess genetic variation in bTB resistance and the underlying genomic architecture of cattle in Cameroon. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,346 slaughter cattle in Cameroon. Retropharyngeal lymph node samples were collected and cultured on Lowenstein Jensen media and the BACTEC MGIT 960 system, and M. bovis was identified using the Hain (R) Genotype kits. A total of 153 cattle were positive for M. bovis and were archived along with a random selection of negative samples. In this study, we genotyped archived samples from 212 cattle. Their genomic diversity was characterized using PCA, hierarchical clustering and admixture analysis. We assessed genetic variation in bTB resistance using heritability analysis and compared quantitative trait loci. Previous research on this study population have shown that Fulani cattle are more susceptible to bTB than mixed breeds. However, here we show that these apparent phenotypic differences in breeds are not reflected by clear genomic differences. At the genetic level, both the Fulani and mixed cattle show similar patterns of admixture with evidence of both taurine and indicine ancestry. There was little European taurine introgression within the studied population. Hierarchical clustering showed clusters of cattle that differed in their susceptibility to bTB. Our findings allude to bTB resistance being polygenic in nature. This study highlights the potential for genetic control of bTB in Africa and the need for further research into the genetics of bTB resistance within African cattle populations.

Caeiro-Dias, G; Brelsford, A; Kaliontzopoulou, A; Meneses-Ribeiro, M; Crochet, PA; Pinho, C	Variable levels of introgression between the endangered Podarcis carbonelli and highly divergent congeneric species	HEREDITY		Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that speciation with gene flow is more common than previously thought. From a conservation perspective, the potential negative effects of hybridization raise concerns on the genetic integrity of endangered species. However, introgressive hybridization has also been growingly recognized as a source of diversity and new advantageous alleles. Carbonell's wall lizard (Podarcis carbonelli) is an endangered species whose distribution overlaps with four other congeneric species. Our goal here was to determine whether P. carbonelli is completely reproductively isolated from its congeners and to evaluate the relevance of hybridization and interspecific gene flow for developing a conservation plan. We used restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to discover SNPs in samples from four contact zones between P. carbonelli and four other species. Principal component analysis, multilocus genotype assignment and interspecific heterozygosity suggest incomplete reproductive isolation and ongoing gene flow between species. However, hybridization dynamics vary across all pairs, suggesting complex interactions between multiple intrinsic and extrinsic barriers. Despite seemingly ubiquitous interspecific gene flow, we found evidence of strong reproductive isolation across most contact zones. Instead, indirect effects of hybridization like waste of reproductive effort in small isolated populations may be more problematic. Our results highlight the need to further evaluate the consequences of introgression for P. carbonelli, both on a geographic and genomic level and included in a comprehensive and urgently needed conservation plan. Besides, those findings will add important insights on the potential effects of hybridization and introgression for endangered species.

Hinojosa, JC; Koubinova, D; Dinca, V; Hernandez-Roldan, J; Munguira, ML; Garcia-Barros, E; Vila, M; Alvarez, N; Mutanen, M; Vila, R	Rapid colour shift by reproductive character displacement in Cupido butterflies	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	lepidoptera; RAD sequencing; reinforcement; reproductive character displacement; speciation	Reproductive character displacement occurs when competition for successful breeding imposes a divergent selection on the interacting species, causing a divergence of reproductive traits. Here, we show that a disputed butterfly taxon is actually a case of male wing colour shift, apparently produced by reproductive character displacement. Using double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and mitochondrial DNA sequencing we studied four butterfly taxa of the subgenus Cupido (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae): Cupido minimus and the taxon carswelli, both characterized by brown males and females, plus C. lorquinii and C. osiris, both with blue males and brown females. Unexpectedly, taxa carswelli and C. lorquinii were close to indistinguishable based on our genomic and mitochondrial data, despite displaying strikingly different male coloration. In addition, we report and analysed a brown male within the C. lorquinii range, which demonstrates that the brown morph occurs at very low frequency in C. lorquinii. Such evidence strongly suggests that carswelli is conspecific with C. lorquinii and represents populations with a fixed male brown colour morph. Considering that these brown populations occur in sympatry with or very close to the blue C. osiris, and that the blue C. lorquinii populations never do, we propose that the taxon carswelli could have lost the blue colour due to reproductive character displacement with C. osiris. Since male colour is important for conspecific recognition during courtship, we hypothesize that the observed colour shift may eventually trigger incipient speciation between blue and brown populations. Male colour seems to be an evolutionarily labile character in the Polyommatinae, and the mechanism described here might be at work in the wide diversification of this subfamily of butterflies.

Much work has focused on identifying genes associated with animal colour, with the candidate gene CYP2J19 identified in laboratory studies as the ketolase converting yellow dietary carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids in birds with red pigments. However, evidence that CYP2J19 explains variation between red and yellow feather coloration in wild populations of birds is lacking. Hybrid zones provide the opportunity to identify genes associated with specific traits. Here we investigate genomic regions associated with colour in red-fronted and yellow-fronted tinkerbirds across a hybrid zone in southern Africa. We sampled 85 individuals, measuring spectral reflectance of forecrown feathers and scoring colours from photographs, while testing for carotenoid presence with Raman spectroscopy. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify associations with carotenoid-based coloration, using double-digest RAD sequencing aligned to a short-read whole genome of a Pogoniulus tinkerbird. Admixture mapping using 104,933 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified a region of chromosome 8 that includes CYP2J19 as the only locus with more than two SNPs significantly associated with both crown hue and crown score, while Raman spectra provided evidence of ketocarotenoids in red feathers. Asymmetric backcrossing in the hybrid zone suggests that yellow-fronted females mate more often with red-fronted males than vice versa. Female red-fronted tinkerbirds mating assortatively with red-crowned males is consistent with the hypothesis that converted carotenoids are an honest signal of quality.

Dias, GR; Dupim, EG; Vanderlinde, T; Mello, B; Carvalho, AB	A phylogenomic study of Steganinae fruit flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae): strong gene tree heterogeneity and evidence for monophyly	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	BUSCO; Incomplete lineage sorting; Introgression; Species tree	Background The Drosophilidae family is traditionally divided into two subfamilies: Drosophilinae and Steganinae. This division is based on morphological characters, and the two subfamilies have been treated as monophyletic in most of the literature, but some molecular phylogenies have suggested Steganinae to be paraphyletic. To test the paraphyletic-Steganinae hypothesis, here, we used genomic sequences of eight Drosophilidae (three Steganinae and five Drosophilinae) and two Ephydridae (outgroup) species and inferred the phylogeny for the group based on a dataset of 1,028 orthologous genes present in all species (> 1,000,000 bp). This dataset includes three genera that broke the monophyly of the subfamilies in previous works. To investigate possible biases introduced by small sample sizes and automatic gene annotation, we used the same methods to infer species trees from a set of 10 manually annotated genes that are commonly used in phylogenetics. Results Most of the 1,028 gene trees depicted Steganinae as paraphyletic with distinct topologies, but the most common topology depicted it as monophyletic (43.7% of the gene trees). Despite the high levels of gene tree heterogeneity observed, species tree inference in ASTRAL, in PhyloNet, and with the concatenation approach strongly supported the monophyly of both subfamilies for the 1,028-gene dataset. However, when using the concatenation approach to infer a species tree from the smaller set of 10 genes, we recovered Steganinae as a paraphyletic group. The pattern of gene tree heterogeneity was asymmetrical and thus could not be explained solely by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Conclusions Steganinae was clearly a monophyletic group in the dataset that we analyzed. In addition to ILS, gene tree discordance was possibly the result of introgression, suggesting complex branching processes during the early evolution of Drosophilidae with short speciation intervals and gene flow. Our study highlights the importance of genomic data in elucidating contentious phylogenetic relationships and suggests that phylogenetic inference for drosophilids based on small molecular datasets should be performed cautiously. Finally, we suggest an approach for the correction and cleaning of BUSCO-derived genomic datasets that will be useful to other researchers planning to use this tool for phylogenomic studies.

Since the 1980s, the commercial Carioca variety has been the most consumed in Brazil, followed by Black and Special beans. The present study evaluates genetic diversity and population structure of 185 Brazilian common bean cultivars using 2827 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The Andean allelic introgression in the Mesoamerican accessions was investigated, and a Carioca panel was tested using an association mapping approach. The results distinguish the Mesoamerican from the Andean accessions, with a prevalence of Mesoamerican accessions (94.6%). When considering the commercial classes, low levels of genetic differentiation were seen, and the Carioca group showed the lowest genetic diversity. However, gain in gene diversity and allelic richness was seen for the modern Carioca cultivars. A set of 1060 'diagnostic SNPs' that show alternative alleles between the pure Mesoamerican and Andean accessions were identified, which allowed the identification of Andean allelic introgression events and shows that there are putative introgression segments in regions enriched with resistance genes. Finally, genome-wide association studies revealed SNPs significantly associated with flowering time, pod maturation, and growth habit, showing that the Carioca Association Panel represents a powerful tool for crop improvements.

Dupuis, JR; Sperling, FAH	Phylogenomic test of mitochondrial clues to archaic ancestors in a group of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Homoploid hybrid speciation; Introgression; Systematics; Genotyping-by-sequencing; Population genomics; Papilionidae	Genomics has revolutionized our understanding of hybridization and introgression, but most of the early evidence for these processes came from studies of mitochondrial introgression. To expand these evolutionary insights from mitochondrial patterns, we evaluate phylogenetic discordance across the nuclear genomes of a hybridizing system, the Papilio machaon group of swallowtail butterflies. This species group contains three hybrid lineages (P. brevicauda, P. joanae, and P. m. kahli) that are geographically disjunct across North America and have complete fixation of a mitochondrial lineage that is otherwise primarily found in P. m. hudsonianus, a boreal subspecies of the Holarctic P. machaon. Genome-wide nuclear markers place the three hybrid lineages as a monophyletic group that is sister to P. polyxenes/P. zelicaon rather than P. machaon, although ancient hybridization between a subspecies of P. machaon and the ancestor of these three lineages is also shown by their greater nuclear affinity to P. m. hudsonianus than to other subspecies of P. machaon. Individuals from contemporary hybrid swarms in Alberta, where mitochondrial DNA fixation has not occurred, were more intermediate between their respective parent species, demonstrating diversity in mito-nuclear discordance following hybrid interactions. Our new phylogenetic findings for the P. machaon species group also include: subspecific paraphyly within P. machaon itself across its Holarctic distribution; paraphyly of P. zelicaon relative to P. polyxenes; and more divergent placement of a Mediterranean species, P. hospiton. These results provide the first comprehensive genomic evaluation of relationships within this species group and provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of hybridization and mitochondrial introgression.

However, the origin of domestication, dispersal route, and the divergence of domestic yaks from different areas are poorly understood. Results Here, we resequenced the genome of 91 domestic yak individuals from 31 populations and 1 wild yaks throughout China. Using a population genomics approach, we observed considerable genetic variation. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the earliest domestications of yak occurred in the south-eastern QTP, followed by dispersal to the west QTP and northeast to SiChuang, Gansu, and Qinghai by two routes. Interestingly, we also found potential associations between the distribution of some breeds and historical trade routes such as the Silk Road and Tang-Tibet Ancient Road. Selective analysis identified 11 genes showing differentiation between domesticated and wild yaks and the potentially positively selected genes in each group were identified and compared among domesticated groups. We also detected an unbalanced pattern of introgression among domestic yak, wild yak, and Tibetan cattle. Conclusions Our research revealed population genetic evidence for three groups of domestic yaks. In addition to providing genomic evidence for the domestication history of yaks, we identified potential selected genes and introgression, which provide a theoretical basis and resources for the selective breeding of superior characters and high-quality yak.

Julca, I; Marcet-Houben, M; Cruz, F; Gomez-Garrido, J; Gaut, BS; Diez, CM; Gut, IG; Alioto, TS; Vargas, P; Gabaldon, T	Genomic evidence for recurrent genetic admixture during the domestication of Mediterranean olive trees (Olea europaea L.)	BMC BIOLOGY	Admixture; Domestication; Genome; Introgression; Olive	Background Olive tree (Olea europaea L. subsp. europaea, Oleaceae) has been the most emblematic perennial crop for Mediterranean countries since its domestication around 6000 years ago in the Levant. Two taxonomic varieties are currently recognized: cultivated (var. europaea) and wild (var. sylvestris) trees. However, it remains unclear whether olive cultivars derive from a single initial domestication event followed by secondary diversification, or whether cultivated lineages are the result of more than a single, independent primary domestication event. To shed light into the recent evolution and domestication of the olive tree, here we analyze a group of newly sequenced and available genomes using a phylogenomics and population genomics framework. Results We improved the assembly and annotation of the reference genome, newly sequenced the genomes of twelve individuals: ten var. europaea, one var. sylvestris, and one outgroup taxon (subsp. cuspidata)-and assembled a dataset comprising whole genome data from 46 var. europaea and 10 var. sylvestris. Phylogenomic and population structure analyses support a continuous process of olive tree domestication, involving a major domestication event, followed by recurrent independent genetic admixture events with wild populations across the Mediterranean Basin. Cultivated olives exhibit only slightly lower levels of genetic diversity than wild forms, which can be partially explained by the occurrence of a mild population bottleneck 3000-14,000 years ago during the primary domestication period, followed by recurrent introgression from wild populations. Genes associated with stress response and developmental processes were positively selected in cultivars, but we did not find evidence that genes involved in fruit size or oil content were under positive selection. This suggests that complex selective processes other than directional selection of a few genes are in place. Conclusions Altogether, our results suggest that a primary domestication area in the eastern Mediterranean basin was followed by numerous secondary events across most countries of southern Europe and northern Africa, often involving genetic admixture with genetically rich wild populations, particularly from the western Mediterranean Basin.

Dona, J; Sweet, AD; Johnson, KP	Comparing rates of introgression in parasitic feather lice with differing dispersal capabilities	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY		Organisms vary in their dispersal abilities, and these differences can have important biological consequences, such as impacting the likelihood of hybridization events. However, there is still much to learn about the factors influencing hybridization, and specifically how dispersal ability affects the opportunities for hybridization. Here, using the ecological replicate system of dove wing and body lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera), we show that species with higher dispersal abilities exhibited increased genomic signatures of introgression. Specifically, we found a higher proportion of introgressed genomic reads and more reticulated phylogenetic networks in wing lice, the louse group with higher dispersal abilities. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in dispersal ability might drive the extent of introgression through hybridization. Jorge Dona, Andrew Sweet and Kevin Johnson find that dove lice species with higher dispersal abilities have stronger genomic signatures of introgression. By using sequence data from multiple species of both wing and body lice from the same species of hosts, the authors are able to control for nearly all factors besides dispersal ability, demonstrating the power of this study system.

This allows us to study 'replicated' instances of secondary contact between closely related species.

Here, we developed an ancestry-informative panel of such SNPs. We then compared their frequencies in newly sampled populations, including samples from within the hybrid zones, and parental populations at different distances from the contact. Results show that close to the hybrid zones, some outlier loci are near to fixation for the heterospecific allele, suggesting enhanced local introgression, or the local sweep of a shared ancestral allele. Conversely, genomic cline analyses, treating local parental populations as the reference, reveal a globally high concordance among loci, albeit with a few signals of asymmetric introgression. Enhanced local introgression at specific loci is consistent with the early transfer of adaptive variants after contact, possibly including asymmetric bi-stable variants (Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities), or haplotypes loaded with fewer deleterious mutations. Having escaped one barrier, however, these variants can be trapped or delayed at the next barrier, confining the introgression locally. These results shed light on the decay of species barriers during phases of contact.

Here we reveal that newly discovered (2013-2016) evolutionarily significant populations of Korogwe tilapia (Oreochromis korogwe) from southern Tanzania are threatened by hybridization with the larger invasive Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). We use a combination of morphology, microsatellite allele frequencies and whole genome sequences to show thatO. korogwefrom southern lakes (Nambawala, Rutamba and Mitupa) are distinct from geographically disjunct populations in northern Tanzania (Zigi River and Mlingano Dam). We also provide genetic evidence ofO. korogwe x niloticushybrids in three southern lakes and demonstrate heterogeneity in the extent of admixture across the genome. Finally, using the least admixed genomic regions we estimate that the northern and southernO. korogwepopulations most plausibly diverged similar to 140,000 years ago, suggesting that the geographical separation of the northern and southern groups is not a result of a recent translocation, and instead these populations represent independent evolutionarily significant units. We conclude that these newly discovered and phenotypically unique cichlid populations are already threatened by hybridization with an invasive species, and propose that these irreplaceable genetic resources would benefit from conservation interventions.

Cronemberger, AA; Aleixo, A; Mikkelsen, EK; Weir, JT	Postzygotic isolation drives genomic speciation between highly cryptic Hypocnemis antbirds from Amazonia	EVOLUTION	Amazon; genetic incompatibility; hybridization; Hypocnemis; postzygotic reproductive isolation; speciation	How species evolve reproductive isolation in the species-rich Amazon basin is poorly understood in vertebrates. Here, we sequenced a reference genome and used a genome-wide sample of SNPs to analyze a hybrid zone between two highly cryptic species ofHypocnemiswarbling-antbirds-the Rondonia warbling-antbird (H. ochrogyna) and Spix's warbling-antbird (H. striata)-in a headwater region of southern Amazonia. We found that both species commonly hybridize, producing F(1)s and a variety of backcrosses with each species but we detected only one F-2-like hybrid. Patterns of heterozygosity, hybrid index, and interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium in hybrid populations closely match expectations under strong postzygotic isolation. Hybrid zone width (15.4 km) was much narrower than expected (211 km) indicating strong selection against hybrids. A remarkably high degree of concordance in cline centers and widths across loci, and a lack of reduced interspecificF(st)between populations close to versus far from the contact zone, suggest that genetic incompatibilities have rendered most of the genome immune to introgression. These results support intrinsic postzygotic isolation as a driver of speciation in a moderately young cryptic species pair from the Amazon and suggest that species richness of the Amazon may be grossly underestimated.

Akopyan, M; Gompert, Z; Klonoski, K; Vega, A; Kaiser, K; Mackelprang, R; Rosenblum, EB; Robertson, JM	Genetic and phenotypic evidence of a contact zone between divergent colour morphs of the iconic red-eyed treefrog	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	coloration; gene flow; genomics; hybridization; introgression; treefrogs	Hybrid zones act as natural laboratories where divergent genomes interact, providing powerful systems for examining the evolutionary processes underlying biological diversity. In this study, we characterized patterns of genomic and phenotypic variation resulting from hybridization between divergent intraspecific lineages of the Neotropical red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas). We found genetic evidence of a newly discovered contact zone and phenotypic novelty in leg colour-a trait suspected to play a role in mediating assortative mating in this species. Analysis of hybrid ancestry revealed an abundance of later-generationF(n)individuals, suggesting persistence of hybrids in the contact zone. Hybrids are predominantly of southern ancestry but are phenotypically more similar to northern populations. Genome-wide association mapping revealed QTL with measurable effects on leg-colour variation, but further work is required to dissect the architecture of this trait and establish causal links. Further, genomic cline analyses indicated substantial variation in patterns of introgression across the genome. Directional introgression of loci associated with different aspects of leg colour are inherited from each parental lineage, creating a distinct hybrid colour pattern. We show that hybridization can generate new phenotypes, revealing the evolutionary processes that potentially underlie patterns of phenotypic diversity in this iconic polytypic frog. Our study is consistent with a role of hybridization and sexual selection in lineage diversification, evolutionary processes that have been implicated in accelerating divergence in the most phenotypically diverse species.

Kinosian, SP; Pearse, WD; Wolf, PG	There and Back Again: Reticulate Evolution in Ceratopteris	AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL	polyploidy; hybridization; RADseq; network analysis; cryptic species	Examples of reticulate evolution are known from throughout the tree of life, but are particularly common in ferns due to their unique reproductive biology and few prezygotic reproductive barriers. However, untangling the complex evolution history of these groups can be challenging. Often, several different types of data are needed to understand the full story of reticulate evolution; for example, chloroplast markers trace maternal inheritance, while nuclear markers complete the picture by suggesting paternal inheritance. Next generation sequencing can provide thousands of nuclear loci, which are informative for estimating reticulate evolutionary histories. The model fern genus Ceratopteris is known to have cryptic allotetraploid taxa, and hybridization is common between many species in the genus. To better understand the patterns of hybridization and reticulate evolution in the genus, we constructed a split network analysis using thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms from samples collected throughout the pan-tropical range of Ceratopteris. Our split network organizes taxa based on genomic similarity, revealing potential introgression between lineages. Combining this analysis with Patterson's D to measure gene flow, as well as contributions by previous authors, we show extensive hybridization and reticulate evolution in Old World Ceratopteris, and also provide evidence for natural hybridization events involving the model species C. richardii.

Park, S; Park, S	Large-scale phylogenomics reveals ancient introgression in Asian Hepatica and new insights into the origin of the insular endemic Hepatica maxima	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS		Hepatica maxima is native to Ulleungdo, which is one of the oceanic islands in Korea, and it likely originated via anagenetic speciation from the Korean mainland species H. asiatica. However, the relationships among the Asian lineages remain unresolved. Phylogenomics based on plant genomes can provide new insights into the evolutionary history of plants. We first generated plastid, mitochondrial and transcriptome sequences of the insular endemic species H. maxima. Using the genomic data for H. maxima, we obtained a phylogenomic dataset consisting of 76 plastid, 37 mitochondrial and 413 nuclear genes from Asian Hepatica and two outgroups. Coalescent- and concatenation-based methods revealed cytonuclear and organellar discordance in the lineage. The presence of gynodioecy with cytoplasmic male sterility in Asian Hepatica suggests that the discordance is correlated with potential disruption of linkage disequilibrium between the organellar genomes. Species network analyses revealed a deep history of hybridization and introgression in Asian Hepatica. We discovered that ancient and recent introgression events occurred throughout the evolutionary history of the insular endemic species H. maxima. The introgression may serve as an important source of genetic variation to facilitate adaptation to the Ulleungdo environment.

Guo, YF; Warner, RM	Dissecting genetic diversity and genomic background ofPetuniacultivars with contrasting growth habits	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH		The cultivated petunia (Petuniaxhybrida) is derived from the progenitor speciesP. axillarisandP. integrifolia. The hybridization dates back only to the 1830s, though intensive breeding efforts have yielded cultivars exhibiting incredible diversity for many traits, including growth habit, flower color, and flower size. Until now, little is known about the genetic diversity and genomic background of modern cultivars. Here we selected a panel of 13 cultivars with contrasting growth habits and three wild species (the progenitors andP. exserta) to estimate the genomic contribution from the ancestral species and to study whether the variation of the genetic origin could be associated with different breeding programs or morphological variability. Transcriptome sequencing identified 1,164,566 SNPs representing 98.4% (32,451) of the transcripts that cover 99.2% (of 52,697,361 bp) of theP. axillaristranscriptome. Cultivars with an upright growth habit had more homozygous alleles and moreP. axillaris-derived alleles than trailing cultivars, while mounded cultivars had intermediate heterozygosity. Unlike previous studies, we found the proportions of alleles derived from each progenitor species varied across cultivars but overall were not biased toward one progenitor species, suggesting diverse selection during cultivar development. For trailing cultivars, alleles potentially introgressed from other wild species (out alleles) were enriched. The out alleles were clustered in particular regions of chromosomes, suggesting that these regions may be hotspots of introgression. Transcripts in these regions were enriched with gene ontology terms associated with growth habit. This study provides novel insight into the contributions of progenitor species to the genomic background of modern petunia cultivars and identifies genome regions that may harbor genes conferring the trailing growth habit for further exploration.

Zeberg, H; Paabo, S	The major genetic risk factor for severe COVID-19 is inherited from Neanderthals	NATURE		A recent genetic association study(1) identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for respiratory failure after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A separate study (COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative)(2) comprising 3,199 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and control individuals showed that this cluster is the major genetic risk factor for severe symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization. Here we show that the risk is conferred by a genomic segment of around 50 kilobases in size that is inherited from Neanderthals and is carried by around 50% of people in south Asia and around 16% of people in Europe. Risk of severe COVID-19 is conferred by a genomic segment that is inherited from Neanderthals and is carried by around 50% and 16% of people in south Asia and Europe, respectively.

Yet there is a worrying lack of evidence-based recommendations and solutions for this emerging problem. We analyzed genome-wide DNA markers and plumage variability in a critically endangered insular songbird, the Black-winged Myna (BWM, Acridotheres melanopterus). This species is highly threatened by the illegal wildlife trade, with its wild population numbering in the low hundreds, and its continued survival urgently depending on ex-situ breeding. Its three subspecies occur along a geographic gradient of melanism and are variably interpreted as three species. However, our integrative approach revealed that melanism poorly reflects the pattern of limited genomic differentiation across BWM subspecies. We also uncovered allelic introgression into the most melanistic subspecies, tertius, from the all-black congeneric Javan Myna (A. javanicus), which is native to the same islands. Based on our results, we recommend the establishment of three separate breeding programs to maintain subspecific traits that may confer local adaptation, but with the option of occasional cross-breeding between insurance populations in order to boost genetic diversity and increase overall viability prospects of each breeding program. Our results underscore the importance of evidence-based integrative approaches when determining appropriate conservation units. Given the rapid increase of terminally endangered organisms in need of ex-situ conservation, this study provides an important blueprint for similar programs dealing with phenotypically variable species.

In this system, specimens have coloration and morphology that differ from patterns observed in their native range, indicating that the contact betweenC. monoculusandC. kelberieliminated reproductive isolation, leading to introgressive hybridization. In this context, we used theLWSanddlx2genes and the random amplified polymorphic DNA technique to characterizeCichlaspecies in the Sao Joao river and to detect possible hybridization processes. The genetic markers identified here showed mismatches between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA inC. monoculusandC. kelberi, sampled both in the reservoir and in the estuarine stretch. Fragments of nuclear DNA from both species, as well as the presence of mitochondrial DNA from one species associated with the nuclear genome of the other, provide strong evidence of hybridization associated with bidirectional genetic introgression. Because hybrids may be more resistant, competitive, and aggressive than their parental species, these invaders may pose a significant threat to native biodiversity in this and other coastal rivers of the region.

Chan, KO; Hutter, CR; Wood, PL; Grismer, LL; Das, I; Brown, RM	Gene flow creates a mirage of cryptic species in a Southeast Asian spotted stream frog complex	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	FrogCap; gene flow; hybridization; hyde; phylogenetic network; phylonet; population genetics	Most new cryptic species are described using conventional tree- and distance-based species delimitation methods (SDMs), which rely on phylogenetic arrangements and measures of genetic divergence. However, although numerous factors such as population structure and gene flow are known to confound phylogenetic inference and species delimitation, the influence of these processes is not frequently evaluated. Using large numbers of exons, introns, and ultraconserved elements obtained using the FrogCap sequence-capture protocol, we compared conventional SDMs with more robust genomic analyses that assess population structure and gene flow to characterize species boundaries in a Southeast Asian frog complex (Pulchrana picturata). Our results showed that gene flow and introgression can produce phylogenetic patterns and levels of divergence that resemble distinct species (up to 10% divergence in mitochondrial DNA). Hybrid populations were inferred as independent (singleton) clades that were highly divergent from adjacent populations (7%-10%) and unusually similar (<3%) to allopatric populations. Such anomalous patterns are not uncommon in Southeast Asian amphibians, which brings into question whether the high levels of cryptic diversity observed in other amphibian groups reflect distinct cryptic species-or, instead, highly admixed and structured metapopulation lineages. Our results also provide an alternative explanation to the conundrum of divergent (sometimes nonsister) sympatric lineages-a pattern that has been celebrated as indicative of true cryptic speciation. Based on these findings, we recommend that species delimitation of continuously distributed cryptic groups should not rely solely on conventional SDMs, but should necessarily examine population structure and gene flow to avoid taxonomic inflation.

Towards this, we used genome-wide SNP marker analysis to determine population structure and patterns of genetic differentiation in terms of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in the natural range ofEucalyptus grandis, a widely cultivated subtropical and temperate species, serving as genomic reference for the genus. We analysed introgression patterns at subchromosomal resolution using a modified ancestry mapping approach and identified provenances with extensive interspecific introgression in response to increased aridity. Furthermore, we describe potentially adaptive genetic variation as explained by environment-associated SNP markers, which also led to the discovery of what is likely a large structural variant. Finally, we show that genes linked to these markers are enriched for biotic and abiotic stress responses.

In this study, whole-genome re-sequencing data from indicine and Brazilian locally adapted taurine cattle breeds were used to detect genomic regions under selective pressure. Within-population and cross-population statistics were combined separately in a single score using the de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) method. Putative sweep regions were revealed by assessing the top 1% of the empirical distribution generated by the DCMS statistics.ResultsA total of 33,328,447 biallelic SNPs with an average read depth of 12.4X passed the hard filtering process and were used to access putative sweep regions. Admixture has occurred in some locally adapted taurine populations due to the introgression of exotic breeds. The genomic inbreeding coefficient based on runs of homozygosity (ROH) concurred with the populations' historical background. Signatures of selection retrieved from the DCMS statistics provided a comprehensive set of putative candidate genes and revealed QTLs disclosing cattle production traits and adaptation to the challenging environments. Additionally, several candidate regions overlapped with previous regions under selection described in the literature for other cattle breeds.ConclusionThe current study reported putative sweep regions that can provide important insights to better understand the selective forces shaping the genome of the indicine and Brazilian locally adapted taurine cattle breeds. Such regions likely harbor traces of natural selection pressures by which these populations have been exposed and may elucidate footprints for adaptation to the challenging climatic conditions.

Martin, BT; Douglas, MR; Chafin, TK; Jr, JSP; Birkhead, RD; Phillips, CA; Douglas, ME	Contrasting signatures of introgression in North American box turtle (Terrapenespp.) contact zones	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	adaptive divergence; ddRAD; genomic cline; hybrid zone; selection; temperature dependence	Hybridization occurs differentially across the genome in a balancing act between selection and migration. With the unprecedented resolution of contemporary sequencing technologies, selection and migration can now be effectively quantified such that researchers can identify genetic elements involved in introgression. Furthermore, genomic patterns can now be associated with ecologically relevant phenotypes, given availability of annotated reference genomes. We do so in North American box turtles (Terrapene) by deciphering how selection affects hybrid zones at the interface of species boundaries and identifying genetic regions potentially under selection that may relate to thermal adaptations. Such genes may impact physiological pathways involved in temperature-dependent sex determination, immune system functioning and hypoxia tolerance. We contrasted these patterns across inter- and intraspecific hybrid zones that differ temporally and biogeographically. We demonstrate hybridization is broadly apparent inTerrapene, but with observed genomic cline patterns corresponding to species boundaries at loci potentially associated with thermal adaptation. These loci display signatures of directional introgression within intraspecific boundaries, despite a genome-wide selective trend against intergrades. In contrast, outlier loci for interspecific comparisons exhibited evidence of being under selection against hybrids. Importantly, adaptations coinciding with species boundaries inTerrapeneoverlap with climatic boundaries and highlight the vulnerability of these terrestrial ectotherms to anthropogenic pressures.

Interspecific gene flow may play a key role in species adaptation to environmental change, as well as in the survival of endangered populations. Despite the fact that hybridization is quite common in plants, many hybridizing species, such asQuercusspp., maintain their integrity, while precise determination of genomic boundaries between species remains elusive. Novel high throughput sequencing techniques have opened up new perspectives in the comparative analysis of genomes and in the study of historical and current interspecific gene flow. In this work, we applied ddRADseq technique and developed anad hocbioinformatics pipeline for the study of ongoing hybridization between two relevant Mediterranean oaks,Q. ilexandQ. suber. We adopted a local scale approach, analyzing adult hybrids (sensu lato) identified in a mixed stand and their open-pollinated progenies. We have identified up to 9,435 markers across the genome and have estimated individual introgression levels in adults and seedlings. Estimated contribution ofQ. suberto the genome is higher, on average, in hybrid progenies than in hybrid adults, suggesting preferential backcrossing with this parental species, maybe followed by selection during juvenile stages against individuals with higherQ. subergenomic contribution. Most discriminating markers seem to be scattered throughout the genome, suggesting that a large number of small genomic regions underlie boundaries between these species. A noticeable proportion of the markers (26%) showed allelic frequencies in adult hybrids very similar to one of the parental species, and very different from the other; a finding that seems relevant for understanding the hybridization process and the occurrence of adaptive introgression. Candidate marker databases developed in this study constitute a valuable resource to design large scale re-sequencing experiments in Mediterranean sclerophyllous oak species and could provide insight in species boundaries and on adaptive introgression betweenQ. suberandQ. ilex.

However, these comprehensive studies did not include some local European populations, including autochthonous Italian cattle. In this study, we assembled a large-scale, genome-wide dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms scored in 3,283 individuals from 205 cattle populations worldwide to assess genome-wide autozygosity and understand better the genetic relationships among these populations. We prioritized European cattle, with a special focus on Italian breeds. Moderate differences in estimates of molecular inbreeding calculated from runs of homozygosity (F-ROH) were observed among domesticated bovid populations from different geographic areas, except for Bali cattle. Our findings indicated that some Italian breeds show the highest estimates of levels of molecular inbreeding among the cattle populations assessed in this study. Patterns of genetic differentiation, shared ancestry, and phylogenetic analysis all suggested the occurrence of gene flow, particularly among populations originating from the same geographical area. For European cattle, we observed a distribution along three main directions, reflecting the known history and formation of the analyzed breeds. The Italian breeds are split into two main groups, based on their historical origin and degree of conservation of ancestral genomic components. The results pinpointed that also Sicilian breeds, much alike Podolian derived-breeds, in the past experienced a similar non-European influence, with African and indicine introgression.

We applied phylogenomic techniques and several complementary statistical tests to show that introgressive hybridization appears to have occurred between close relatives of Arabidopsis, resulting in cytonuclear discordance and impacting our understanding of species relationships in the group. The composition of introgressed and retained genes indicates that selection against incompatible cytonuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions likely acted during introgression, whereas linkage also contributed to genome composition through the retention of ancient haplotype blocks. We also applied divergence-based tests to determine the species branching order and distinguish donor from recipient lineages. Surprisingly, these analyses suggest that cytonuclear discordance arose via extensive nuclear, rather than cytoplasmic, introgression. If true, this would mean that most of the nuclear genome was displaced during introgression whereas only a small proportion of native alleles were retained.

Buck, R; Hyasat, S; Hossfeld, A; Flores-Renteria, L	Patterns of hybridization and cryptic introgression among one- and four-needled pinyon pines	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Cryptic introgression; genomics; hybridization; needle number; pines; pinyon resin canals	Background and Aims Pinyon pine hybridization is widely acknowledged, but the frequency of and contributors to such interspecific mating remain largely unstudied. Pinus quadrifolia has three to four needles per fascicle, suggesting that it is a result of hybridization between the five-needled P. juarezensis and the single-needled P. monophylla. In this study we address the taxonomic validity of P. juarezensis, the hybrid origin of P. quadrifolia and the presence of hybridization and intermediate morphology as a result of interspecific hybridization in this complex. Methods We address these questions by combining a genomic and morphological approach. We generated 1868 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect genetic clusters using principal co-ordinates analyis, discriminant analysis of principal components, fastSTRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE analyses, and performed a morphological analysis of the leaves. Key Results We found that the five-needled pinyons did not differ genetically from the four-needled P. quadrifolia. reducing the status of P. juarezensis to P. quadrifolia. We also found no evidence that P. quadrifolia is of hybrid origin from P. juarezensis x P. monophylla but is instead a genetically distinct species with natural needle number variation that has yet to be explained. Hybridization does occur in this complex, but mostly between P. quadrifolia and P. californiarum, and less commonly between P. quadrifolia and P. monophylla. Interestingly, some hybrid derivatives were detected between both single-needled taxa, P. monophylla and P. californiarum, a hybrid combination that has not yet been proposed. Hybrids have intermediate morphology when they have similar genetic contributions from both parental species; however, when one parent contributes more, hybrid derivatives resemble the parent with higher genetic contribution, resulting in cryptic introgression. Conclusions Our detailed sampling across the distribution of this complex allows us to describe the patterns of hybridization among these taxa, resolves an ancient taxonomic conflict and provides insights into the challenges of exclusively using morphological traits when identifying these taxa with cryptic hybridization and variable morphology.

In this study, we employ ddRAD sequence data to test taxonomic hypotheses of hybrid origins in Carex salina and C. ramenskii (Carex section Phacocystis). Sequence data from multiple Norwegian and Icelandic populations of the putative hybrid and parental species were generated for hundreds of ddRAD loci. These data were used to estimate geographical structuring of genetic diversity and admixture and to explicitly test for hybrid origins using several analytical approaches. Our results indicate recurrent hybrid origins for the populations of C. salina and C. ramenskii sampled in our study and show that these populations are characterized by high interspecific heterozygosity. Our results support the idea that hybridization may indeed play an important role in the diversification of lineages of Carex and highlight the important role that clonal propagation might play in maintaining hybrid populations.

Wang, J; Dong, SY; Yang, LH; Harris, A; Schneider, H; Kang, M	Allopolyploid Speciation Accompanied by Gene Flow in a Tree Fern	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	allopolyploidy; coalescent; Cyatheaceae; Gymnosphaera; hybridization speciation; RADseq	Hybridization in plants may result in hybrid speciation or introgression and, thus, is now widely understood to be an important mechanism of species diversity on an evolutionary timescale. Hybridization is particularly common in ferns, as is polyploidy, which often results from hybrid crosses. Nevertheless, hybrid speciation as an evolutionary process in fern lineages remains poorly understood. Here, we employ flow cytometry, phylogeny, genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism data sets, and admixture and coalescent modeling to show that the scaly tree fern, Gymnosphaera metteniana is a naturally occurring allotetraploid species derived from hybridization between the diploids, G. denticulata and G. gigantea. Moreover, we detected ongoing gene flow between the hybrid species and its progenitors, and we found that G. gigantea and G. metteniana inhabit distinct niches, whereas climatic niches of G. denticulata and G. metteniana largely overlap. Taken together, these results suggest that either some degree of intrinsic genetic isolation between the hybrid species and its parental progenitors or ecological isolation over short distances may be playing an important role in the evolution of reproductive barriers. Historical climate change may have facilitated the origin of G. metteniana, with the timing of hybridization coinciding with a period of intensification of the East Asian monsoon during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods in southern China. Our study of allotetraploid G. metteniana represents the first genomic-level documentation of hybrid speciation in scaly tree ferns and, thus, provides a new perspective on evolution in the lineage.

Shang, HY; Hess, J; Pickup, M; Field, DL; Ingvarsson, PK; Liu, JQ; Lexer, C	Evolution of strong reproductive isolation in plants: broad-scale patterns and lessons from a perennial model group	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	speciation; hybridization; reproductive isolation; gene flow; topology discordance; recombination rate	Many recent studies have addressed the mechanisms operating during the early stages of speciation, but surprisingly few studies have tested theoretical predictions on the evolution of strong reproductive isolation (RI). To help address this gap, we first undertook a quantitative review of the hybrid zone literature for flowering plants in relation to reproductive barriers. Then, using Populus as an exemplary model group, we analysed genome-wide variation for phylogenetic tree topologies in both early- and late-stage speciation taxa to determine how these patterns may be related to the genomic architecture of RI. Our plant literature survey revealed variation in barrier complexity and an association between barrier number and introgressive gene flow. Focusing on Populus, our genome-wide analysis of tree topologies in speciating poplar taxa points to unusually complex genomic architectures of RI, consistent with earlier genome-wide association studies. These architectures appear to facilitate the 'escape' of introgressed genome segments from polygenic barriers even with strong RI, thus affecting their relationships with recombination rates. Placed within the context of the broader literature, our data illustrate how phylogenomic approaches hold great promise for addressing the evolution and temporary breakdown of RI during late stages of speciation.

Stankowski, S; Westram, AM; Zagrodzka, ZB; Eyres, I; Broquet, T; Johannesson, K; Butlin, RK	The evolution of strong reproductive isolation between sympatric intertidal snails	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	demographic inference; Littorina arcana; Littorina saxatilis; reproductive mode; speciation	The evolution of strong reproductive isolation (RI) is fundamental to the origins and maintenance of biological diversity, especially in situations where geographical distributions of taxa broadly overlap. But what is the history behind strong barriers currently acting in sympatry? Using whole-genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, we inferred (i) the evolutionary relationships, (ii) the strength of RI, and (iii) the demographic history of divergence between two broadly sympatric taxa of intertidal snail. Despite being cryptic, based on external morphology, Littorina arcana and Littorina saxatilis differ in their mode of female reproduction (egg-laying versus brooding), which may generate a strong post-zygotic barrier. We show that egg-laying and brooding snails are closely related, but genetically distinct. Genotyping of 3092 snails from three locations failed to recover any recent hybrid or backcrossed individuals, confirming that RI is strong. There was, however, evidence for a very low level of asymmetrical introgression, suggesting that isolation remains incomplete. The presence of strong, asymmetrical RI was further supported by demographic analysis of these populations. Although the taxa are currently broadly sympatric, demographic modelling suggests that they initially diverged during a short period of geographical separation involving very low gene flow. Our study suggests that some geographical separation may kick-start the evolution of strong RI, facilitating subsequent coexistence of taxa in sympatry. The strength of RI needed to achieve sympatry and the subsequent effect of sympatry on RI remain open questions.

Yamasaki, YY; Kakioka, R; Takahashi, H; Toyoda, A; Nagano, AJ; Machida, Y; Moller, PR; Kitano, J	Genome-wide patterns of divergence and introgression after secondary contact between Pungitius sticklebacks	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Pungitius; freshwater type; brackish-water type; de novo assembly; tipping point; speciation continuum	Speciation is a continuous process. Although it is known that differential adaptation can initiate divergence even in the face of gene flow, we know relatively little about the mechanisms driving complete reproductive isolation and the genomic patterns of divergence and introgression at the later stages of speciation. Sticklebacks contain many pairs of sympatric species differing in levels of reproductive isolation and divergence history. Nevertheless, most previous studies have focused on young species pairs. Here, we investigated two sympatric stickleback species, Pungitius pungitius and P. sinensis, whose habitats overlap in eastern Hokkaido; these species show hybrid male sterility, suggesting that they may be at a late stage of speciation. Our demographic analysis using whole-genome sequence data showed that these species split 1.73 Ma and came into secondary contact 37 200 years ago after a period of allopatry. This long period of allopatry might have promoted the evolution of intrinsic incompatibility. Although we detected on-going gene flow and signatures of introgression, overall genomic divergence was high, with considerable heterogeneity across the genome. The heterogeneity was significantly associated with variation in recombination rate. This sympatric pair provides new avenues to investigate the late stages of the stickleback speciation continuum.

Hybridization and introgression are not uncommon in closely related populations that experience secondary contact during a range expansion. Allen's Hummingbird (Selasphorus sasin) in California comprises two subspecies: the migratoryS. s. sasin,which winters in central Mexico and breeds in central and northern California, and the residentS. s. sedentarius, which lives and breeds year-round on several of the Channel Islands off the California coast. Within recent decades, Allen's Hummingbirds have been found living and breeding year-round in the southern California peri-urban mainland near Los Angeles. Ornithologists assumed that the L.A. birds were an expansion of the island subspecies,S. s. sedentariusdue to similar but very subtle morphological characteristics. However, the genetic relationships among the three putative populations of Allen's hummingbird-migratory, southern California mainland, and island-are unknown. We investigated these relationships by analyzing variation of single nucleotide polymorphisms from the three geographic regions whereS. sasinare present. Our population genomic analyses indicate thatS. sasinhummingbirds inhabiting mainland southern California are a hybrid population resulting from admixture betweenS. s. sasinandS. s. sedentarius. From one perspective, these results may be interpreted as a positive development forS. s. sasinas the growing population represent an overall increase in theS. sasinpopulation, and the expanding population contains a significant representation ofS. s. sasinalleles.

Dreissig, S; Maurer, A; Sharma, R; Milne, L; Flavell, AJ; Schmutzer, T; Pillen, K	Natural variation in meiotic recombination rate shapes introgression patterns in intraspecific hybrids between wild and domesticated barley	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	barley; cohesin; genomic introgression; hybridization; meiotic recombination; REC8	Meiotic recombination rates vary considerably between species, populations and individuals. The genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes plays a major role in evolution by breaking linkage between advantageous and deleterious alleles in the case of introgressions. Identifying recombination rate modifiers is thus of both fundamental and practical interest to understand and utilize variation in meiotic recombination rates. We investigated recombination rate variation in a large intraspecific hybrid population (named HEB-25) derived from a cross between domesticated barley and 25 wild barley accessions. We observed quantitative variation in total crossover number with a maximum of a 1.4-fold difference between subpopulations and increased recombination rates across pericentromeric regions. The meiosis-specific alpha-kleisin cohesin subunitREC8was identified as a candidate gene influencing crossover number and patterning. Furthermore, we quantified wild barley introgression patterns and revealed how local and genome-wide recombination rate variation shapes patterns of introgression. The identification of allelic variation inREC8in combination with the observed changes in crossover patterning suggest a difference in how chromatin loops are tethered to the chromosome axis, resulting in reduced crossover suppression across pericentromeric regions. Local and genome-wide recombination rate variation is shaping patterns of introgressions and thereby directly influences the consequences of linkage drag.

A growing body of literature has reported evidence of ancient hybridization events or natural hybrid zones in primates, including humans; however, we still have relatively limited knowledge about the pattern and history of admixture because there have been little studies that simultaneously achieved genome-scale analysis and a geographically wide sampling of wild populations. Our study applied double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to samples from the six localities in and around the provisional hybrid zone of rhesus and long-tailed macaques and evaluated population structure, phylogenetic relationships, demographic history, and geographic clines of morphology and allele frequencies. A latitudinal gradient of genetic components was observed, highlighting the transition from rhesus (north) to long-tailed macaque distribution (south) as well as the presence of one northern population of long-tailed macaques exhibiting unique genetic structure. Interspecific gene flow was estimated to have recently occurred after an isolation period, and the migration rate from rhesus to long-tailed macaques was slightly greater than in the opposite direction. Although some rhesus macaque-biased alleles have widely introgressed into long-tailed macaque populations, the inflection points of allele frequencies have been observed as concentrated around the traditionally recognized interspecific boundary where morphology discontinuously changed; this pattern was more pronounced in the X chromosome than in autosomes. Thus, due to geographic separation before secondary contact, reproductive isolation could have evolved, contributing to the maintenance of an interspecific boundary and species-specific morphological characteristics.

In this study, we generated a chromosome-level genome assembly ofO. rufipogonusing a combination of short-read sequencing, single-molecule sequencing, BioNano and Hi-C platforms. The genome sequence (399.8 Mb) was assembled into 46 scaffolds on the 12 chromosomes, with contig N50 and scaffold N50 of 13.2 Mb and 20.3 Mb, respectively. The genome contains 36,520 protein-coding genes, and 49.37% of the genome consists of repetitive elements. The genome has strong synteny with those of theO. sativasubspeciesindicaandjaponica, but containing some large structural variations. Evolutionary analysis unveiled the polyphyletic origins ofO. sativa, in which thejaponicaandindicagenome formations involved different divergentO. rufipogon(includingO. nivara) lineages, accompanied by introgression of genomic regions betweenjaponicaandindica. This high-quality reference genome provides insight on the genome evolution of the wild rice and the origins of theO. sativasubspecies, and valuable information for basic research and rice breeding.

Uncovering parallelism and introgressed populations can complicate management of threatened species as parallelism may have influenced conservation unit designations and admixed populations are not generally considered under legislations. We examined high coverage whole-genome sequences of 30 caribou (Rangifer tarandus) from across North America and Greenland, representing divergent intraspecific lineages, to investigate parallelism and levels of introgression contributing to the formation of ecotypes. Caribou are split into four subspecies and 11 extant conservation units, known as designatable units (DUs), in Canada. Using genomes from all four subspecies and six DUs, we undertake demographic reconstruction and confirm two previously inferred instances of parallel evolution in the woodland subspecies and uncover an additional instance of parallelism of the eastern migratory ecotype. Detailed investigations reveal introgression in the woodland subspecies, with introgressed regions found spread throughout the genomes encompassing both neutral and functional sites. Our investigations using whole genomes highlight the difficulties in unequivocally demonstrating parallelism through adaptive introgression in nonmodel species with complex demographic histories, with standing variation and introgression both potentially involved. Additionally, the impact of parallelism and introgression on conservation policy for management units needs to be considered in general, and the caribou designations will need amending in light of our results. Uncovering and decoupling parallelism and differential patterns of introgression will become prevalent with the availability of comprehensive genomic data from nonmodel species, and we highlight the need to incorporate this into conservation unit designations.

The genomic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) remains poorly understood. Besides, the available genetic resources from cotton cultivars are limited. By applying restriction site-associated DNA marker sequencing (RAD-seq) technology to 582 tetraploid cotton accessions, we confirmed distinct genomic regions on chromosomes A06 and A08 in Upland cotton cultivar subgroups. Based on the pedigree, reported QTLs, introgression analyses, and genome-wide association study (GWAS), we suggest that these divergent regions might have resulted from the introgression of exotic lineages ofG. hirsutumlandraces and their wild relatives. These regions were the typical genomic signatures that might be responsible for maturity and fiber quality on chromosome A06 and chromosome A08, respectively. Moreover, these genomic regions are located in the putative pericentromeric regions, implying that their application will be challenging. In the study, based on high-density SNP markers, we reported two genomic signatures on chromosomes A06 and A08, which might originate from the introgression events in the Upland cotton population. Our study provides new insights for understanding the impact of historic introgressions on population divergence and important agronomic traits of modern Upland cotton cultivars.

Furthermore, structural variation as chromosomal rearrangements may facilitate adaptation despite high gene flow. However, our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms impending or favouring local adaptation in the presence of gene flow is still limited to a restricted number of study systems. In this study, we examined how demographic history, shared ancestral polymorphism, arid gene flow among glacial lineages contribute to local adaptation to sea conditions in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We first assembled a 490-Mbp draft genome of M. villosus to map our RAD sequence reads. Then, we used a large data set of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (25,904 filtered SNPs) genotyped in 1,310 individuals collected from 31 spawning sites in the northwest Atlantic. We reconstructed the history of divergence among three glacial lineages and showed that they probably diverged from 3.8 to 1.8 million years ago and experienced secondary contacts. Within each lineage, our analyses provided evidence for large N e and high gene flow among spawning sites. Within the Northwest Atlantic lineage, we detected a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement leading to the occurrence of three haplogroups. Genotype-environment associations revealed molecular signatures of local adaptation to environmental conditions prevailing at spawning sites. Our study also suggests that both shared polymorphisms among lineages, resulting from standing genetic variation or introgression, and chromosomal rearrangements may contribute to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow.

Their rapid radiation has been strongly influenced by hybridization, which has created new species and allowed sharing of color patterning alleles between mimetic species pairs. While these processes have frequently been observed in widespread species with contiguous distributions, many Heliconius species inhabit patchy or rare habitats that may strongly influence the origin and spread of species and color patterns. Here, we assess the effects of historical population fragmentation and unique biology on the origins, genetic health, and color pattern evolution of two rare and sparsely distributed Brazilian butterflies, Heliconius hermathena and Heliconius nattereri.ResultsWe assembled genomes and re-sequenced whole genomes of eight H. nattereri and 71 H. hermathena individuals. These species harbor little genetic diversity, skewed site frequency spectra, and high deleterious mutation loads consistent with recent population bottlenecks. Heliconius hermathena consists of discrete, strongly isolated populations that likely arose from a single population that dispersed after the last glacial maximum. Despite having a unique color pattern combination that suggested a hybrid origin, we found no genome-wide evidence that H. hermathena is a hybrid species. However, H. hermathena mimicry evolved via introgression, from co-mimetic Heliconius erato, of a small genomic region upstream of the color patterning gene cortex.ConclusionsHeliconius hermathena and H. nattereri population fragmentation, potentially driven by historical climate change and recent deforestation, has significantly reduced the genetic health of these rare species. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence that introgression of color patterning alleles between co-mimetic species appears to be a general feature of Heliconius evolution.

Here we report reference genomes for the llama, and for the guanaco and vicuna (their putative wild progenitors), compare these with the published alpaca genome, and resequence seven individuals of all four species to better understand domestication and introgression between the llama and alpaca. Results Phylogenomic analysis confirms that the llama was domesticated from the guanaco and the alpaca from the vicuna. Introgression was much higher in the alpaca genome (36%) than the llama (5%) and could be dated close to the time of the Spanish conquest, approximately 500 years ago. Introgression patterns are at their most variable on the X-chromosome of the alpaca, featuring 53 genes known to have deleterious X-linked phenotypes in humans. Strong genome-wide introgression signatures include olfactory receptor complexes into both species, hypertension resistance into alpaca, and fleece/fiber traits into llama. Genomic signatures of domestication in the llama include male reproductive traits, while in alpaca feature fleece characteristics, olfaction-related and hypoxia adaptation traits. Expression analysis of the introgressed region that is syntenic to human HSA4q21, a gene cluster previously associated with hypertension in humans under hypoxic conditions, shows a previously undocumented role for PRDM8 downregulation as a potential transcriptional regulation mechanism, analogous to that previously reported at high altitude for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. Conclusions The unprecedented introgression signatures within both domestic camelid genomes may reflect post-conquest changes in agriculture and the breakdown of traditional management practices.

Oyster aquaculture industries in many parts of the world depend on commercially available seed (hatchery-farmed) or naturalized/wild oysters to move onto a farm (naturalized-farmed). It is therefore important to understand genetic variation among populations and farm types. Here, we genotype naturalized/wild populations from France, Japan, China, and most extensively in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We also genotype cultured populations from throughout the Northern Hemisphere to compare with naturalized populations. In total, 16,942 markers were identified using double-digest RAD-sequencing in 182 naturalized, 112 hatchery-farmed, and 72 naturalized-farmed oysters (n = 366). Consistent with previous studies, very low genetic differentiation was observed around Vancouver Island (meanF(ST) = 0.0019) and low differentiation between countries in the Japan-Canada-France historical translocation lineage (France-CanadaF(ST) = 0.0024; Japan-CanadaF(ST) = 0.0060). Chinese populations were more differentiated (China-JapanF(ST) = 0.0241). Hatchery-propagated populations had higher interindividual relatedness suggesting family structure. Within-population inbreeding was not detected on farms, but nucleotide diversity and polymorphism rate were lower in one farm population. Moving oysters from nature onto farms did not result in strong within-generation selection. Private alleles at substantial frequency were identified in several hatchery populations grown in BC, suggesting nonlocal origins. Tests of selection identified outlier loci consistent with selective differences associated with domestication, in some cases consistently identified in multiple farms. Top outlier candidates were nearby genes involved in calcium signaling and calmodulin activity. Implications of potential introgression from hatchery-farmed oysters depend on whether naturalized populations are valued as a locally adapted resource or as an introduced, invasive species. Given the value of the industry in BC and the challenges the industry faces (e.g., climate change, crop losses, biotic stressors), this remains an important question.

Zhang, XJ; Kim, B; Lohmueller, KE; Huerta-Sanchez, E	The Impact of Recessive Deleterious Variation on Signals of Adaptive Introgression in Human Populations	GENETICS	adaptive introgression; archaic humans; exon density; heterosis; recessive deleterious mutations	Admixture with archaic hominins has altered the landscape of genomic variation in modern human populations. Several gene regions have been identified previously as candidates of adaptive introgression (AI) that facilitated human adaptation to specific environments. However, simulation-based studies have suggested that population genetic processes other than adaptive mutations, such as heterosis from recessive deleterious variants private to populations before admixture, can also lead to patterns in genomic data that resemble AI. The extent to which the presence of deleterious variants affect the false-positive rate and the power of current methods to detect AI has not been fully assessed. Here, we used extensive simulations under parameters relevant for human evolution to show that recessive deleterious mutations can increase the false positive rates of tests for AI compared to models without deleterious variants, especially when the recombination rates are low. We next examined candidates of AI in modern humans identified from previous studies, and show that 24 out of 26 candidate regions remain significant, even when deleterious variants are included in the null model. However, two AI candidate genes, HYAL2 and HLA, are particularly susceptible to high false positive signals of AI due to recessive deleterious mutations. These genes are located in regions of the human genome with high exon density together with low recombination rate, factors that we show increase the rate of false-positives due to recessive deleterious mutations. Although the combination of such parameters is rare in the human genome, caution is warranted in such regions, as well as in other species with more compact genomes and/or lower recombination rates. In sum, our results suggest that recessive deleterious mutations cannot account for the signals of AI in most, but not all, of the top candidates for AI in humans, suggesting they may be genuine signals of adaptation.

Bangs, MR; Douglas, MR; Brunner, PC; Douglas, ME	Reticulate evolution as a management challenge: Patterns of admixture with phylogenetic distance in endemic fishes of western North America	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	adaptive management; ddRAD; hybridization; introduced species; introgression; reproductive isolation; species of concern	Admixture in natural populations is a long-standing management challenge, with population genomic approaches offering means for adjudication. We now more clearly understand the permeability of species boundaries and the potential of admixture for promoting adaptive evolution. These issues particularly resonate in western North America, where tectonism and aridity have fragmented and reshuffled rivers over millennia, in turn promoting reticulation among endemic fishes, a situation compounded by anthropogenic habitat modifications and non-native introductions. The melding of historic and contemporary admixture has both confused and stymied management. We underscore this situation with a case study that quantifies basin-wide admixture among a group of native and introduced fishes by employing double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing. Our approach: (a) quantifies the admixed history of 343 suckers (10 species of Catostomidae) across the Colorado River Basin; (b) gauges admixture within the context of phylogenetic distance and ecological specialization; and (c) extrapolates potential drivers of introgression across hybrid crosses that involve endemic as well as invasive species. Our study extends across an entire freshwater basin and expands previous studies more limited in scope both geographically and taxonomically. Our results detected admixture involving all 10 species, with habitat alterations not only accelerating the breakdown of reproductive isolation, but also promoting introgression. Hybridization occurred across the genus despite phylogenetic distance, whereas introgression was only detected within subgenera, implicating phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization as drivers of reproductive isolation. Understanding the extent of admixture and reproductive isolation across multiple species serves to disentangle their reticulate evolutionary histories and provides a broadscale perspective for basin-wide conservation and management.

Linde, AM; Sawangproh, W; Cronberg, N; Szovenyi, P; Lagercrantz, U	Evolutionary History of theMarchantia polymorpha Complex	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Marchantia polymorpha; hybridization; bryophytes; incomplete lineage sorting; whole-genome sequencing; phylogeny; introgression	The potential role of introgression in evolution has gained increased interest in recent years. Although some fascinating examples have been reported, more information is needed to generalize the importance of hybridization and introgression for adaptive divergence. As limited data exist on haploid dominant species, we analyzed genomes of three subspecies of the liverwortMarchantia polymorpha. We used available genomic data for subsp.ruderalisand carried out whole-genome (PacBio) sequencing for one individual each of subsp.montivagansand subsp.polymorphaas well as Illumina resequencing of additional genomes for all three subspecies. The three subspecies were compared againstM. paleaceaas outgroup. Our analyses revealed separation of the three taxa, but all three possible topologies were richly represented across the genomes, and the underlying divergence order less obvious. This uncertainty could be the result of the divergence of the three subspecies close in time, or that introgression has been frequent since divergence. In particular, we found that pseudo-chromosome 2 in subsp.montivaganswas much more diverged than other parts of the genomes. This could either be explained by specific capture of chromosome 2 from an unknown related species through hybridization or by conservation of chromosome 2 despite intermittent or ongoing introgression affecting more permeable parts of the genomes. A higher degree of chromosomal rearrangements on pseudo-chromosome 2 support the second hypothesis. Species tree analyses recovered an overall topology where subsp.montivagansdiverged first and subsp.ruderalisand subsp.polymorphaappeared as sister lineages. Each subspecies was associated with its own chloroplast and mitochondrial haplotype group. Our data suggest introgression but refute a previous hypothesis that subsp.ruderalisis a new stabilized hybrid between the other two subspecies.

Here we report the chromosome-level genome assembly and the genomic investigation of a nonclassic domestication example, bitter gourd (Momordica charantia), an important Asian vegetable and medicinal plant of the family Cucurbitaceae. Population resequencing revealed the divergence between wild and South Asian cultivars about 6,000 y ago, followed by the separation of the Southeast Asian cultivars about 800 y ago, with the latter exhibiting more extreme trait divergence from wild progenitors and stronger signs of selection on fruit traits. Unlike some crops where the largest phenotypic changes and traces of selection happened between wild and cultivar groups, in bitter gourd large differences exist between two regional cultivar groups, likely reflecting the distinct consumer preferences in different countries. Despite breeding efforts toward increasing female flower proportion, a gynoecy locus exhibits complex patterns of balanced polymorphism among haplogroups, with potential signs of selective sweep within haplogroups likely reflecting artificial selection and introgression from cultivars back to wild accessions. Our study highlights the importance to investigate such nonclassic example of domestication showing signs of balancing selection and polygenic trait architecture in addition to classic selective sweep in Mendelian factors.

Paguem, A; Abanda, B; Achukwi, MD; Baskaran, P; Czemmel, S; Renz, A; Eisenbarth, A	Whole genome characterization of autochthonousBos taurus brachycerosand introducedBos indicus indicuscattle breeds in Cameroon regarding their adaptive phenotypic traits and pathogen resistance	BMC GENETICS	Whole genome sequencing; Trypanotolerance; Bos taurus; Namchi; Kapsiki; Bos indicus; white Fulani; Red Fulani; Gudali; Cameroon	Background African indigenous taurine cattle display unique adaptive traits shaped by husbandry management, regional climate and exposure to endemic pathogens. They are less productive with respect to milk and meat production which has been associated with amongst others, small size, traditional beliefs, husbandry practices, limited feed resources, disease burden and lack of sustained breeding for trait improvement. This resulted in the severe dwindling of their population size rendering them vulnerable to extinction. The Namchi taurine cattle breed is referred to as [Namchi (Doayo)] and shows resistance traits against trypanosome infection and exposure to tick infestation. Nonetheless, the historically later introduced Zebu cattle are the main cattle breeds in Africa today, even though they suffer more from locally prevailing pathogens. By using a whole genome sequencing approach, we sequenced with high depth for the first time the genomes of five cattle breeds from Cameroon in order to provide a valuable genetic resource for future African cattle breeding: the Namchi, an endangered trypano-tolerant taurine breed, the Kapsiki, an indigenous trypano-susceptible taurine breed, and three Zebu (Bos indicus indicus) breeds: Ngaoundere Gudali, White Fulani and Red Fulani. Results Approximately 167 Gigabases of raw sequencing data were generated for each breed and mapped to the cattle reference genomes ARS-UCD1.2 and UMD3.1.The coverage was 103 to 140-fold when aligning the reads to ARS-UCD1.2 with an average mapping rate of similar to 99%, and 22 to 30-fold when aligning the reads to UMD3.1 with an average mapping rate of similar to 64%. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from analysis using the genome ARS-UCD1.2 were compared with reference genomes of EuropeanBos taurusHolstein, the AsianBos indicusBrahman, and the African trypanotolerant N'Dama breeds. A total of similar to 100 million (M) SNPs were identified and 7.7 M of those were breed-specific. An approximately 11.1 M constituted of small insertions and deletions. By using only breed-specific non-synonymous variants we identified genes as genetic signatures and associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms that could explain certain cattle-breed specific phenotypes such as increased tolerance against trypanosome parasites in the Namchi breed and heat tolerance in the Kapsiki breed. Phylogenetic analysis grouped, except for Namchi, theBos taurusbreeds Kapsiki, N'Dama and Holstein together while theB. indicusbreeds White and Red Fulani, Gudali and Brahman clustered separately. The deviating result for Namchi indicates a hybrid status of the selected animal with a recent introgression of Zebu genes into its genome. Conclusions The findings provide the first comprehensive set of genome-wide variant data of the most important Cameroonian cattle breeds. The genomic data shall constitute a foundation for breed amelioration whilst exploiting the heritable traits and support conservation efforts for the endangered local cattle breeds.

Wagner, DN; Curry, RL; Chen, N; Lovette, IJ; Taylor, SA	Genomic regions underlying metabolic and neuronal signaling pathways are temporally consistent in a moving avian hybrid zone	EVOLUTION	Chickadee; hybrid index; glutamate; synaptic transmission; tension zone	The study of hybrid zones can provide insight into the genetic basis of species differences that are relevant for the maintenance of reproductive isolation. Hybrid zones can also provide insight into climate change, species distributions, and evolution. The hybrid zone between black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) is shifting northward in response to increasing winter temperatures but is not increasing in width. This pattern indicates strong selection against chickadees with admixed genomes. Using high-resolution genomic data, we identified regions of the genomes that are outliers in both time points and do not introgress between the species; these regions may be involved in the maintenance of reproductive isolation. Genes involved in metabolic regulation processes were overrepresented in this dataset. Several gene ontology categories were also temporally consistent-including glutamate signaling, synaptic transmission, and catabolic processes-but the nucleotide variants leading to this pattern were not. Our results support recent findings that hybrids between black-capped and Carolina chickadees have higher basal metabolic rates than either parental species and suffer spatial memory and problem-solving deficits. Metabolic breakdown, as well as spatial memory and problem-solving, in hybrid chickadees may act as strong postzygotic isolation mechanisms in this moving hybrid zone.

There are seven breeds in this region including Meishan (MS), Erhualian (EHL), Jiaxing Black (JXB), Fengjing (FJ), Shawutou (SWT), Mi (MI), and Hongdenglong (HDL). At present, these breeds are facing a great threat of population decline, inbreeding depression and lineage admixture since Western commercial pigs have dominated in Chinese pig industry. To provide better conservation strategies and identify candidate genes under selection for these breeds, we explored genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to uncover genetic variability and relatedness, population structure, historical admixture and genomic signature of selection of 440 pigs representing the most comprehensive lineages of these breeds in TL region in a context of 1228 pigs from 45 Eurasian breeds. We showed that these breeds were more closely related to each other as compared to other Eurasian breeds, defining one of the main ancestral lineages of Chinese indigenous pigs. These breeds can be divided into two subgroups, one including JXB and FJ, and the other comprising of EHL, MI, HDL, MS, and SWT. In addition, HDL was highly inbred whereas EHL and MS had more abundant genetic diversity owing to their multiple conservation populations. Moreover, we identified a list of candidate genes under selection for body size and prolificacy. Our results would benefit the conservation of these valuable breeds and improve our understanding of the genetic mechanisms of body size and fecundity in pigs.

Continual gene flow between domestic and wild populations has compromised its gene pool, especially since the last century when human encroachment and habitat loss would have led to increased contact opportunities. We present the first combined genomic and morphological admixture assessment of a native population of red junglefowl, sampled from recolonized parts of its former range in Singapore, partly using whole genomes resequenced from dozens of individuals. Crucially, this population was genomically anchored to museum samples from adjacent Peninsular Malaysia collected similar to 110-150 years ago to infer the magnitude of modern domestic introgression across individuals. We detected a strong feral-wild genomic continuum with varying levels of domestic introgression in different subpopulations across Singapore. Using a trait scoring scheme, we determined morphological thresholds that can be used by conservation managers to successfully identify individuals with low levels of domestic introgression, and selected traits that were particularly useful for predicting domesticity in genomic profiles. Our study underscores the utility of combined genomic and morphological approaches in population management and suggests a way forward to safeguard the allelic integrity of wild red junglefowl in perpetuity.

Tonzo, V; Papadopoulou, A; Ortego, J	Genomic footprints of an old affair: Single nucleotide polymorphism data reveal historical hybridization and the subsequent evolution of reproductive barriers in two recently diverged grasshoppers with partly overlapping distributions	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	coalescent-based simulations; ddRAD-seq; hybridization; introgression; reproductive isolation	Secondary contact in close relatives can result in hybridization and the admixture of previously isolated gene pools. However, after an initial period of hybridization, reproductive isolation can evolve through different processes and lead to the interruption of gene flow and the completion of the speciation process. Omocestus minutissimus and O. uhagonii are two closely related grasshoppers with partially overlapping distributions in the Central System mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogenomic approaches and a coalescent-based simulation framework to evaluate alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow. Our analyses rejected the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization but revealed past introgression in the area where the distributions of the two species overlap. Overall, these results point to a scenario of historical gene flow after secondary contact followed by the evolution of reproductive isolation that currently prevents hybridization among sympatric populations.

Because of the frequent occurrence of so-called reticulate evolution (i.e. repeated hybridization of partially diverged populations), their taxonomy has not been adequately resolved, despite the fact that they belong to the most abundant rodent genus in Ethiopia and are important as pests and carriers of pathogens (e.g. hantaviruses). Here we analysed material for 623 Stenocephalemys specimens using integrative taxonomy composed of genomic analyses (388 nuclear markers and complete mitogenomes), 2D-geometric morphometry of skulls and classical morphometry of external traits. The genus consists of six clearly defined gene pools (= species), characterized by specific morphology, ecology and distribution. Two of them, described here as new species, live in fragmented populations in Afroalpine habitats in the north-western part of the Ethiopian Highlands. We also showed that mitochondrial DNA is not applicable as a universal diagnostic tool for species discrimination in Stenocephalemys, because of multiple cases of mitochondrial introgression. This finding illustrates the utility of the genus as a suitable model for future studies of mito-nuclear coevolution along an elevational gradient.

Duranton, M; Allal, F; Valiere, S; Bouchez, O; Bonhomme, F; Gagnaire, PA	The contribution of ancient admixture to reproductive isolation between European sea bass lineages	EVOLUTION LETTERS	Ancient admixture; introgression; reproductive isolation; genomic conflicts; marine fish	Understanding how new species arise through the progressive establishment of reproductive isolation (RI) barriers between diverging populations is a major goal in Evolutionary Biology. An important result of speciation genomics studies is that genomic regions involved in RI frequently harbor anciently diverged haplotypes that predate the reconstructed history of species divergence. The possible origins of these old alleles remain much debated, as they relate to contrasting mechanisms of speciation that are not yet fully understood. In the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), the genomic regions involved in RI between Atlantic and Mediterranean lineages are enriched for anciently diverged alleles of unknown origin. Here, we used haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequences to test whether divergent haplotypes could have originated from a closely related species, the spotted sea bass (Dicentrarchus punctatus). We found that an ancient admixture event betweenD. labraxandD. punctatusis responsible for the presence of shared derived alleles that segregate at low frequencies in both lineages ofD. labrax. An exception to this was found within regions involved in RI between the twoD. labraxlineages. In those regions, archaic tracts originating fromD. punctatuslocally reached high frequencies or even fixation in Atlantic genomes but were almost absent in the Mediterranean. We showed that the ancient admixture event most likely occurred betweenD. punctatusand theD. labraxAtlantic lineage, while Atlantic and MediterraneanD. labraxlineages were experiencing allopatric isolation. Our results suggest that local adaptive introgression and/or the resolution of genomic conflicts provoked by ancient admixture have probably contributed to the establishment of RI between the twoD. labraxlineages.

The time, extent, and genomic effect of the introgressions from archaic humans into ancestors of extant human populations remain some of the most exciting venues of population genetics research in the past decade. Several studies have shown population-specific signatures of introgression events from Neanderthals, Denisovans, and potentially other unknown hominin populations in different human groups. Moreover, it was shown that these introgression events may have contributed to phenotypic variation in extant humans, with biomedical and evolutionary consequences. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the unusually divergent haplotypes in the Eurasian genomes and show that they can be traced back to multiple introgression events. In parallel, we document hundreds of deletion polymorphisms shared with Neanderthals. A locus-specific analysis of one such shared deletion suggests the existence of a direct introgression event from the Altai Neanderthal lineage into the ancestors of extant East Asian populations. Overall, our study is in agreement with the emergent notion that various Neanderthal populations contributed to extant human genetic variation in a population-specific manner.

Even though both taxa have traditionally been regarded as valid species, their taxonomic status remains under debate. In the present study, we used phylogeographic approaches and molecular methods of species delimitation to elucidate the taxonomic issues between both species, based on 1478 base pairs from four genomic regions. We found haplotypes shared between the two species, particularly in relation to nuclear DNA (nuDNA) sequences. The molecular delimitation of species supported the discrimination of L. purpureus and L. campechanus as distinct evolutionary units. Nonetheless, a unidirectional gene flow was found from L. campechanus towards L. purpureus. Therefore, it seems plausible to infer that L. campechanus and L. purpureus are two evolutionary units in which the apparent sharing of haplotypes should be driven by introgression.

We affirm the recent taxonomic separation of the two species and then focus on diversity within the more widespread of the two species, C. clarum. To guide further study of the system and what it offers to understanding the genomics of the differentiation and speciation processes, we develop and present a hypothesis to explain mitonuclear discordance that emerged in ourdata. Following a period of historical allopatry, secondary contact has resulted in an eastern mitochondrial genome replacing the western mitochondrial genome in western populations. This is predicted under a population-level invasion in the opposite direction, that of the western population invading the range of the eastern one. Mitochondrial captures can be driven by neutral, demographic processes, or adaptive mechanisms, and we favor the hypothesized capture being driven by neutral means. We cannot fully reject the adaptive process but suggest how these alternatives may be further tested. We acknowledge an alternative hypothesis, which finds some support in phenotypic data published elsewhere, namely that outcomes of secondary contact have been more complex than our current genomic data suggest. Discriminating and reconciling these two alternative hypotheses, which may not be mutually exclusive, could be tested with closer sampling at levels of population, individual, and nucleotide than has so far been possible. This would be further aided by knowledge of the genetic basis to phenotypic variation described elsewhere.

In this study, we assessed the impact of artificial selection and environmental adaptation by comparing whole-genome sequences from European taurine and Asian indicine breeds and from African cattle. Next, we studied the impact of divergent selection by exploiting predicted and experimental functional annotation of the bovine genome. Results We identified selective sweeps in beef cattle taurine and indicine populations, including a 430-kb selective sweep on indicine cattle chromosome 5 that is located between 47,670,001 and 48,100,000 bp and spans five genes, i.e.HELB,IRAK3,ENSBTAG00000026993,GRIP1and part ofHMGA2. Regions under selection in indicine cattle display significant enrichment for promoters and coding genes. At the nucleotide level, sites that show a strong divergence in allele frequency between European taurine and Asian indicine are enriched for the same functional categories. We identified nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding regions that are fixed for different alleles between subspecies, eight of which were located within theDNA helicase B(HELB) gene. By mining information from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project, we found thatHELBcarries mutations that are specific to indicine cattle but also found in taurine cattle, which are known to have been subject to indicine introgression from breeds, such as N'Dama, Anatolian Red, Marchigiana, Chianina, and Piedmontese. Based on in-house genome sequences, we proved that mutations inHELBsegregate independently of the copy number variationHMGA2-CNV, which is located in the same region. Conclusions Major genomic sequence differences betweenBos taurusandBos indicusare enriched for promoter and coding regions. We identified a 430-kb selective sweep in Asian indicine cattle located on chromosome 5, which carries SNPs that are fixed in indicine populations and located in the coding sequences of theHELBgene.HELBis involved in the response to DNA damage including exposure to ultra-violet light and is associated with reproductive traits and yearling weight in tropical cattle. Thus,HELBlikely contributed to the adaptation of tropical cattle to their harsh environment.

Ottenburghs, J; Honka, J; Musken, GJDM; Ellegren, H	Recent introgression between Taiga Bean Goose and Tundra Bean Goose results in a largely homogeneous landscape of genetic differentiation	HEREDITY		Several studies have uncovered a highly heterogeneous landscape of genetic differentiation across the genomes of closely related species. Specifically, genetic differentiation is often concentrated in particular genomic regions (islands of differentiation) that might contain barrier loci contributing to reproductive isolation, whereas the rest of the genome is homogenized by introgression. Alternatively, linked selection can produce differentiation islands in allopatry without introgression. We explored the influence of introgression on the landscape of genetic differentiation in two hybridizing goose taxa: the Taiga Bean Goose (Anser fabalis) and the Tundra Bean Goose (A. serrirostris). We re-sequenced the whole genomes of 18 individuals (9 of each taxon) and, using a combination of population genomic summary statistics and demographic modeling, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of these birds. Next, we quantified the impact of introgression on the build-up and maintenance of genetic differentiation. We found evidence for a scenario of allopatric divergence (about 2.5 million years ago) followed by recent secondary contact (about 60,000 years ago). Subsequent introgression events led to high levels of gene flow, mainly from the Tundra Bean Goose into the Taiga Bean Goose. This scenario resulted in a largely undifferentiated genomic landscape (genome-wide F-ST = 0.033) with a few notable differentiation peaks that were scattered across chromosomes. The summary statistics indicated that some peaks might contain barrier loci while others arose in allopatry through linked selection. Finally, based on the low genetic differentiation, considerable morphological variation and incomplete reproductive isolation, we argue that the Taiga and the Tundra Bean Goose should be treated as subspecies.

Sexual selection can contribute to the evolution of reproductive barriers, but it remains poorly understood how sexual traits impact gene flow in secondary contact. Here, we show that a recently evolved suite of sexual traits that function in male-male competition mediates gene flow between two lineages of wall lizards (Podarcis muralis). Gene flow was relatively low and asymmetric in the presence of exaggerated male morphology and coloration compared to when the lineages share the ancestral phenotype. Putative barrier loci were enriched in genomic regions that were highly differentiated between the two lineages and showed low concordance between the transects. The exception was a consistently low genetic exchange around ATXN1, a gene that modulates social behavior. We suggest that this gene may contribute to the male mate preferences that are known to cause lineage-assortative mating in this species. Although female choice modulates the degree of reproductive isolation in a variety of taxa, wall lizards demonstrate that both male-male competition and male mate choice can contribute to the extent of gene flow between lineages.

Jones, MR; Mills, LS; Jensen, JD; Good, JM	Convergent evolution of seasonal camouflage in response to reduced snow cover across the snowshoe hare range	EVOLUTION	Climate change; dominance; introgression; local adaptation; migration; parallel evolution	Determining how different populations adapt to similar environments is fundamental to understanding the limits of adaptation under changing environments. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) typically molt into white winter coats to remain camouflaged against snow. In some warmer climates, hares have evolved brown winter camouflage-an adaptation that may spread in response to climate change. We used extensive range-wide genomic data to (1) resolve broad patterns of population structure and gene flow and (2) investigate the factors shaping the origins and distribution of winter-brown camouflage variation. In coastal Pacific Northwest (PNW) populations, winter-brown camouflage is known to be determined by a recessive haplotype at the Agouti pigmentation gene. Our phylogeographic analyses revealed deep structure and limited gene flow between PNW and more northern Boreal populations, where winter-brown camouflage is rare along the range edge. Genome sequencing of a winter-brown snowshoe hare from Alaska shows that it lacks the winter-brown PNW haplotype, reflecting a history of convergent phenotypic evolution. However, the PNW haplotype does occur at low frequency in a winter-white population from Montana, consistent with the spread of a locally deleterious recessive variant that is masked from selection when rare. Simulations of this population further show that this masking effect would greatly slow the selective increase of the winter-brown Agouti allele should it suddenly become beneficial (e.g., owing to dramatic declines in snow cover). Our findings underscore how allelic dominance can shape the geographic extent and rate of convergent adaptation in response to rapidly changing environments.

As a group, X. fastidiosa is divided into distinct subspecies with allopatric historical distributions and patterns of multiple introductions from numerous source populations. The capacity of X. fastidiosa to successfully colonize and cause disease in naive plant hosts varies among subspecies, and potentially, among populations. Within Central America (i.e. Costa Rica) two X. fastidiosa subspecies coexist: the native subsp. fastidiosa and the introduced subsp. pauca. Using whole genome sequences, the patterns of gene gain/loss, genomic introgression, and genetic diversity were characterized within Costa Rica and contrasted to other X. fastidiosa populations.ResultsWithin Costa Rica, accessory and core genome analyses showed a highly malleable genome with numerous intra- and inter-subspecific gain/loss events. Likewise, variable levels of inter-subspecific introgression were found within and between both coexisting subspecies; nonetheless, the direction of donor/recipient subspecies to the recombinant segments varied. Some strains appeared to recombine more frequently than others; however, no group of genes or gene functions were overrepresented within recombinant segments. Finally, the patterns of genetic diversity of subsp. fastidiosa in Costa Rica were consistent with those of other native populations (i.e. subsp. pauca in Brazil).ConclusionsOverall, this study shows the importance of characterizing local evolutionary and ecological history in the context of world-wide pathogen distribution.

Markova, S; Hornikova, M; Lanier, HC; Henttonen, H; Searle, JB; Weider, LJ; Kotlik, P	High genomic diversity in the bank vole at the northern apex of a range expansion: The role of multiple colonizations and end-glacial refugia	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	approximate Bayesian computation; Clethrionomys glareolus; climate change; cryptic refugia; genotyping-by-sequencing; population genomics	The history of repeated northern glacial cycling and southern climatic stability has long dominated explanations for how genetic diversity is distributed within temperate species in Eurasia and North America. However, growing evidence indicates the importance of cryptic refugia for northern colonization dynamics. An important geographic region to assess this is Fennoscandia, where recolonization at the end of the last glaciation was restricted to specific routes and temporal windows. We used genomic data to analyse genetic diversity and colonization history of the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) throughout Europe (>800 samples) with Fennoscandia as the northern apex. We inferred that bank voles colonized Fennoscandia multiple times by two different routes; with three separate colonizations via a southern land-bridge route deriving from a Carpathian glacial refugium and one via a north-eastern route from an Eastern glacial refugium near the Ural Mountains. Clustering of genome-wide SNPs revealed high diversity in Fennoscandia, with eight genomic clusters: three of Carpathian origin and five Eastern. Time estimates revealed that the first of the Carpathian colonizations occurred before the Younger Dryas (YD), meaning that the first colonists survived the YD in Fennoscandia. Results also indicated that introgression between bank and northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus) took place in Fennoscandia just after end-glacial colonization. Therefore, multiple colonizations from the same and different cryptic refugia, temporal and spatial separations and interspecific introgression have shaped bank vole genetic variability in Fennoscandia. Together, these processes drive high genetic diversity at the apex of the northern expansion in this emerging model species.

Yurchenko, AA; Masri, RA; Khrabrova, NV; Sibataev, AK; Fritz, ML; Sharakhova, MV	Genomic differentiation and intercontinental population structure of mosquito vectors Culex pipiens pipiens and Culex pipiens molestus	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS		Understanding the population structure and mechanisms of taxa diversification is important for organisms responsible for the transmission of human diseases. Two vectors of West Nile virus, Culex pipiens pipiens and Cx. p. molestus, exhibit epidemiologically important behavioral and physiological differences, but the whole-genome divergence between them was unexplored. The goal of this study is to better understand the level of genomic differentiation and population structures of Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. molestus from different continents. We sequenced and compared the whole genomes of 40 individual mosquitoes from two locations in Eurasia and two in North America. Principal Component, ADMIXTURE, and neighbor joining analyses of the nuclear genomes identified two major intercontinental, monophyletic clusters of Cx. p. pipiens and Cx. p. molestus. The level of genomic differentiation between the subspecies was uniform along chromosomes. The ADMIXTURE analysis determined signatures of admixture in Cx. p. pipens populations but not in Cx. p. molestus populations. Comparison of mitochondrial genomes among the specimens showed a paraphyletic origin of the major haplogroups between the subspecies but a monophyletic structure between the continents. Thus, our study identified that Cx. p. molestus and Cx. p. pipiens represent different evolutionary units with monophyletic origin that have undergone incipient ecological speciation.

Lamichhaney, S; Han, F; Webster, MT; Grant, BR; Grant, PR; Andersson, L	Female-biased gene flow between two species of Darwin's finches	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION		By analysing pooled whole-genome sequences from two species of Darwin's finches, both before and after interbreeding and back-crossing, the authors show that gene exchange between the two species is asymmetric and female biased. The mosaic nature of hybrid genomes is well recognized, but little is known of how they are shaped initially by patterns of breeding, selection, recombination and differential incompatibilities. On the small Galapagos island of Daphne Major, two species of Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis and G. scandens, hybridize rarely and back-cross bidirectionally with little or no loss of fitness under conditions of plentiful food. We used whole-genome sequences to compare genomes from periods before and after successful interbreeding followed by back-crossing. We inferred extensive introgression from G. fortis to G. scandens on autosomes and mitochondria but not on the Z chromosome. The unique combination of long-term field observations and genomic data shows that the reduction of gene flow for Z-linked loci primarily reflects female-biased gene flow, arising from a hybrid-male disadvantage in competition for high-quality territories and mates, rather than from genetic incompatibilities at Z-linked loci.

In this study, we present a genetic analysis of 547 samples of cassava grown by 192 smallholder farmers, which were sampled at random within four districts in Uganda. We genotyped these samples at 287,952 single nucleotide polymorphisms using genotyping-by-sequencing and co-analyzed them with 349 cassava samples from the national breeding program in Uganda. The samples collected from smallholders consisted of 86 genetically unique varieties, as assessed using a genetic distance-based approach. Of these varieties, most were cultivated in only one district (30 in Kibaale, 19 in Masindi, 14 in Arua, and three in Apac), and only three were cultivated across all districts. The genetic differentiation we observed among farming districts in Uganda (mean fixation index [F-ST] = .003) is similar to divergence observed within other countries. Despite the fact that none of the breeding lines were directly observed in farmer fields, genetic divergence between the populations was low (F-ST = .020). Interestingly, we detected the presence of introgressions from the wild relative M. glaziovii Mull. Arg. on chromosomes 1 and 4, which implies ancestry with cassava breeding lines. Given the apparently similar pool of alleles in the breeding germplasm, it is likely that breeders have the raw genetic material they require to match the farmer-preferred trait combinations necessary for adoption. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic makeup of cassava currently grown by smallholder farmers and relative to that of plant breeding germplasm.

This paper describes the genotyping of nine stable allolines isolated in the offspring from crossing of T. dicoccum x T. aestivum L. using 21 microsatellite (simple sequence repeats-SSR) markers and two cytoplasmic mitochondrial markers to orf256, rps19-p genes; evaluation of drought tolerance of allolines at different stages of ontogenesis (growth parameters, relative water content, quantum efficiency of Photosystem II, electron transport rate, energy dissipated in Photosystem II); and the study of drought tolerance regulator gene Dreb-1 with allele-specific PCR (AS-MARKER) and partial sequence analysis. Most allolines differ in genomic composition and T. dicoccum introgressions. Four allolines-D-b-05, D-d-05, D-d-05b, and D-41-05-revealed signs of drought tolerance of varying degrees. The more drought tolerant D-41-05 line was also characterized by Dreb-B1 allele introgression from T. dicoccum. A number of non-specific patterns and significant differences in allolines in regulation of physiological parameters in drought conditions is identified. Changes in photosynthetic activity in stress-drought are shown to reflect the level of drought tolerance of the forms studied. The contribution of different combinations of nuclear/cytoplasmic genome and alleles of Dreb-1 gene in allolines to the formation of stress tolerance and photosynthetic activity is discussed.

Chaturvedi, S; Lucas, LK; Buerkle, CA; Fordyce, JA; Forister, ML; Nice, CC; Gompert, Z	Recent hybrids recapitulate ancient hybrid outcomes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS		Genomic outcomes of hybridization depend on selection and recombination in hybrids. Whether these processes have similar effects on hybrid genome composition in contemporary hybrid zones versus ancient hybrid lineages is unknown. Here we show that patterns of introgression in a contemporary hybrid zone in Lycaeides butterflies predict patterns of ancestry in geographically adjacent, older hybrid populations. We find a particularly striking lack of ancestry from one of the hybridizing taxa, Lycaeides melissa, on the Z chromosome in both the old and contemporary hybrids. The same pattern of reduced L. melissa ancestry on the Z chromosome is seen in two other ancient hybrid lineages. More generally, we find that patterns of ancestry in old or ancient hybrids are remarkably predictable from contemporary hybrids, which suggests selection and recombination affect hybrid genomes in a similar way across disparate time scales and during distinct stages of speciation and species breakdown. Hybrid genomes provide a window into the speciation process over time. Here, Chaturvedi et al. use Lycaeides butterflies from hybrid zones of different ages to show that selection and recombination have repeatable effects on hybrid genome composition across timescales.

Crowl, AA; Manos, PS; McVay, JD; Lemmon, AR; Lemmon, EM; Hipp, AL	Uncovering the genomic signature of ancient introgression between white oak lineages (Quercus)	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	anchored hybrid enrichment; ancient introgression; gene flow; hybridisation; phylogenetic network; phylogenomics; Quercus; white oaks	Botanists have long recognised interspecific gene flow as a common occurrence within white oaks (Quercus section Quercus). Historical allele exchange, however, has not been fully characterised and the complex genomic signals resulting from the combination of vertical and horizontal gene transmission may confound phylogenetic inference and obscure our ability to accurately infer the deep evolutionary history of oaks. Using anchored enrichment, we obtained a phylogenomic dataset consisting of hundreds of single-copy nuclear loci. Concatenation, species-tree and network analyses were carried out in an attempt to uncover the genomic signal of ancient introgression and infer the divergent phylogenetic topology for the white oak clade. Locus and site-level likelihood comparisons were then conducted to further explore the introgressed signal within our dataset. Historical, intersectional gene flow is suggested to have occurred between an ancestor of the Eurasian Roburoid lineage and Quercus pontica and North American Dumosae and Prinoideae lineages. Despite extensive time past, our approach proved successful in detecting the genomic signature of ancient introgression. Our results, however, highlight the importance of sampling and the use of a plurality of analytical tools and methods to sufficiently explore genomic datasets, uncover this signal, and accurately infer evolutionary history.

In this study, we investigate global patterns of oak diversity and test the hypothesis that there are regions of the oak genome that are broadly informative about phylogeny. We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing nearly 250 Quercus species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world's oaks. We use a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method to reconstruct shifts in lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling biases. We then map the > 20 000 RAD-seq loci back to an annotated oak genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and phylogenetic support across the phylogeny. Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification, probably in response to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity. The strong support for the phylogeny contrasts with high genomic heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal and introgression. Oaks are phylogenomic mosaics, and their diversity may in fact depend on the gene flow that shapes the oak genome.

Vendrami, DLJ; De Noia, M; Telesca, L; Brodte, EM; Hoffman, JI	Genome-wide insights into introgression and its consequences for genome-wide heterozygosity in the Mytilus species complex across Europe	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	genetic variation; genome-wide heterozygosity; hybridization; introgression; Mytilus; Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD sequencing); stock structure	The three mussel species comprising the Mytilus complex are widespread across Europe and readily hybridize when they occur in sympatry, resulting in a mosaic of populations with varying genomic backgrounds. Two of these species, M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis, are extensively cultivated across Europe, with annual production exceeding 230,000 tonnes. The third species, M. trossulus, is considered commercially damaging as hybridization with this species results in weaker shells and poor meat quality. We therefore used restriction site associated DNA sequencing to generate high-resolution insights into the structure of the Mytilus complex across Europe and to resolve patterns of introgression. Inferred species distributions were concordant with the results of previous studies based on smaller numbers of genetic markers, with M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis predominating in northern and southern Europe respectively, while introgression between these species was most pronounced in northern France and the Shetland Islands. We also detected traces of M. trossulus ancestry in several northern European populations, especially around the Baltic and in northern Scotland. Finally, genome-wide heterozygosity, whether quantified at the population or individual level, was lowest in M. edulis, intermediate in M. galloprovincialis, and highest in M. trossulus, while introgression was positively associated with heterozygosity in M. edulis but negatively associated with heterozygosity in M. galloprovincialis. Our study will help to inform mussel aquaculture by providing baseline information on the genomic backgrounds of different Mytilus populations across Europe and by elucidating the effects of introgression on genome-wide heterozygosity, which is known to influence commercially important traits such as growth, viability, and fecundity in mussels.

Moreno-Letelier, A; Aguirre-Liguori, JA; Pinero, D; Vazquez-Lobo, A; Eguiarte, LE	The relevance of gene flow with wild relatives in understanding the domestication process	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE	domestication; gene flow; introgression; maize; Mexico; teosinte	The widespread use of genomic tools has allowed for a deeper understanding of the genetics and the evolutionary dynamics of domestication. Recent studies have suggested that multiple domestications and introgression are more common than previously thought. However, the ability to correctly infer the many aspects of domestication process depends on having an adequate representation of wild relatives. Cultivated maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is one of the most important crops in the world, with a long and a relatively well-documented history of domestication. The current consensus points towards a single domestication event from teosinte Zea mays ssp. parviglumis from the Balsas Basin in Southwestern Mexico. However, the underlying diversity of teosintes from Z. mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea mays ssp. mexicana was not taken into account in early studies. We used 32 739 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from 29 teosinte populations and 43 maize landraces to explore the relationship between wild and cultivated members of Zea. We then inferred the levels of gene flow among teosinte populations and maize, the degree of population structure of Zea mays subspecies, and the potential domestication location of maize. We confirmed a strong geographic structure within Z. mays ssp. parviglumis and documented multiple gene flow events with other members of the genus, including an event between Z. mays ssp. mexicana and maize. Our results suggest that the likely ancestor of maize may have been domesticated in Jalisco or in the southern Pacific Coast and not in the Balsas Basin as previously thought. In this context, different populations of both teosinte subspecies have contributed to modern maize's gene pool. Our results point towards a long period of domestication marked by gene flow with wild relatives, confirming domestication as long and ongoing process.

Bariah, I; Keidar-Friedman, D; Kashkush, K	Identification and characterization of large-scale genomic rearrangements during wheat evolution	PLOS ONE		Following allopolyploidization, nascent polyploid wheat species react with massive genomic rearrangements, including deletion of transposable element-containing sequences. While such massive rearrangements are considered to be a prominent process in wheat genome evolution and speciation, their structure, extent, and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we retrieved similar to 3500 insertions of a specific variant of Fatima, one of the most dynamic gypsy long-terminal repeat retrotransposons in wheat from the recently available high-quality genome drafts of Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) and Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides or wild emmer, the allotetraploid mother of all modern wheats. The dynamic nature of Fatima facilitated the identification of large (i.e., up to similar to 1 million bases) Fatima-containing insertions/deletions (indels) upon comparison of bread wheat and wild emmer genomes. We characterized 11 such indels using computer-assisted analysis followed by PCR validation, and found that they might have occurred via unequal intra-strand recombination or double-strand break (DSB) events. Additionally, we observed one case of introgression of novel DNA fragments from an unknown source into the wheat genome. Our data thus indicate that massive large-scale DNA rearrangements might play a prominent role in wheat speciation.

Since then, the two species have been in contact in southern Europe and, therefore, have the potential to exchange genes. Recent evolutionary genomic works have provided empirical evidence that C. gigas and C. angulata exhibit partial reproductive isolation. Although hybridization occurs in nature, the rate of interspecific gene flow varies across the genome, resulting in highly heterogeneous genome divergence. Taking this biological property into account is important to characterize genetic ancestry and population structure in oysters. Here, we identified a subset of ancestry-informative makers from the most differentiated regions of the genome using existing genomic resources. We developed two different panels in order to (i) easily differentiate C. gigas and C. angulata, and (ii) describe the genetic diversity and structure of the cupped oyster with a particular focus on French Atlantic populations. Our results confirm high genetic homogeneity among Pacific cupped oyster populations in France and reveal several cases of introgressions between Portuguese and Japanese oysters in France and Portugal.

These can cross rhizobium species boundaries, but it is unclear how many other genes show similar mobility. Here, we investigate inter-species introgression using de novo assembly of 196 Rhizobium leguminosarum sv. trifolii genomes. The 196 strains constituted a five-species complex, and we calculated introgression scores based on gene-tree traversal to identify 171 genes that frequently cross species boundaries. Rather than relying on the gene order of a single reference strain, we clustered the introgressing genes into four blocks based on population structure-corrected linkage disequilibrium patterns. The two largest blocks comprised 125 genes and included the symbiosis genes, a smaller block contained 43 mainly chromosomal genes, and the last block consisted of three genes with variable genomic location. All introgression events were likely mediated by conjugation, but only the genes in the symbiosis linkage blocks displayed overrepresentation of distinct, high-frequency haplotypes. The three genes in the last block were core genes essential for symbiosis that had, in some cases, been mobilized on symbiosis plasmids. Inter-species introgression is thus not limited to symbiosis genes and plasmids, but other cases are infrequent and show distinct selection signatures.

Suture zones offer the opportunity to compare these processes across multiple species. In this paper we use reduced-complexity genomic data to compare the genetic and phenotypic structure and hybridization patterns of two mimetic butterfly species, Ithomia salapia and Oleria onega (Nymphalidae: Ithomiini), each consisting of a pair of lineages differentiated for their wing colour pattern and that come into contact in the Andean foothills of Peru. Despite similarities in their life history, we highlight major differences, both at the genomic and phenotypic level, between the two species. These differences include the presence of hybrids, variations in wing phenotype, and genomic patterns of introgression and differentiation. In I. salapia, the two lineages appear to hybridize only rarely, whereas in O. onega the hybrids are not only more common, but also genetically and phenotypically more variable. We also detected loci statistically associated with wing colour pattern variation, but in both species these loci were not over-represented among the candidate barrier loci, suggesting that traits other than wing colour pattern may be important for reproductive isolation. Our results contrast with the genomic patterns observed between hybridizing lineages in the mimetic Heliconius butterflies, and call for a broader investigation into the genomics of speciation in Ithomiini - the largest radiation of mimetic butterflies.

Redmond, SN; Sharma, A; Sharakhov, I; Tu, ZJ; Sharakhova, M; Neafsey, DE	Linked-read sequencing identifies abundant microinversions and introgression in the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti	BMC BIOLOGY	Structural variation; Chromosomal inversions; Introgression; Aedes aegypti	Background Aedes aegypti is the principal mosquito vector of Zika, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. Two subspecies of Ae. aegypti exhibit phenotypic divergence with regard to habitat, host preference, and vectorial capacity. Chromosomal inversions have been shown to play a major role in adaptation and speciation in dipteran insects and would be of great utility for studies of Ae. aegypti. However, the large and highly repetitive genome of Ae. aegypti makes it difficult to detect inversions with paired-end short-read sequencing data, and polytene chromosome analysis does not provide sufficient resolution to detect chromosome banding patterns indicative of inversions. Results To characterize chromosomal diversity in this species, we have carried out deep Illumina sequencing of linked-read (10X Genomics) libraries in order to discover inversion loci as well as SNPs. We analyzed individuals from colonies representing the geographic limits of each subspecies, one contact zone between subspecies, and a closely related sister species. Despite genome-wide SNP divergence and abundant microinversions, we do not find any inversions occurring as fixed differences between subspecies. Many microinversions are found in regions that have introgressed and have captured genes that could impact behavior, such as a cluster of odorant-binding proteins that may play a role in host feeding preference. Conclusions Our study shows that inversions are abundant and widely shared among subspecies of Aedes aegypti and that introgression has occurred in regions of secondary contact. This library of 32 novel chromosomal inversions demonstrates the capacity for linked-read sequencing to identify previously intractable genomic rearrangements and provides a foundation for future population genetics studies in this species.

Hybridization and the resulting introgression can drive the success of invasive species via the rapid acquisition of adaptive traits. The Dutch elm disease pandemics in the past 100 years were caused by three fungal lineages with permeable reproductive barriers: Ophiostoma ulmi, Ophiostoma novo-ulmi subspecies novo-ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi subspecies americana. Using whole-genome sequences and growth phenotyping of a worldwide collection of isolates, we show that introgression has been the main driver of genomic diversity and that it impacted fitness-related traits. Introgressions contain genes involved in host-pathogen interactions and reproduction. Introgressed isolates have enhanced growth rate at high temperature and produce different necrosis sizes on an in vivo model for pathogenicity. In addition, lineages diverge in many pathogenicity-associated genes and exhibit differential mycelial growth in the presence of a proxy of a host defence compound, implying an important role of host trees in the molecular and functional differentiation of these pathogens.

However, little is known about the underlying genomic changes that occurred during introgression and the types of traits affected by introgression. To address these questions, 525 animals were characterized using an SNP array to detect genomic regions that had been introgressed from European to indigenous Chinese breeds. The functions of genes located in introgressed regions were also investigated. Our data show that five out of six indigenous Chinese breeds show evidence of introgression from Western pigs, and eight introgressed genome regions are shared by five of the Chinese breeds. A region located on chr13: 12.8-13.1 M was affected by both introgression and artificial selection, and this region contains the glucose absorption related gene, OXSM, and the sensory related gene, NGLY.

Hartmann, FE; de la Vega, RCR; Gladieux, P; Ma, WJ; Hood, ME; Giraud, T	Higher Gene Flow in Sex-Related Chromosomes than in Autosomes during Fungal Divergence	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	sex chromosomes; inversions; local adaptation; host specialization; fungi; divergence with gene flow; speciation; introgression	Nonrecombining sex chromosomes are widely found to be more differentiated than autosomes among closely related species, due to smaller effective population size and/or to a disproportionally large-X effect in reproductive isolation. Although fungal mating-type chromosomes can also display large nonrecombining regions, their levels of differentiation compared with autosomes have been little studied. Anther-smut fungi from the Microbotryum genus are castrating pathogens of Caryophyllaceae plants with largely nonrecombining mating-type chromosomes. Using whole genome sequences of 40 fungal strains, we quantified genetic differentiation among strains isolated from the geographically overlapping North American species and subspecies of Silene virginica and S. caroliniana. We inferred that gene flow likely occurred at the early stages of divergence and then completely stopped. We identified large autosomal genomic regions with chromosomal inversions, with higher genetic divergence than the rest of the genomes and highly enriched in selective sweeps, supporting a role of rearrangements in preventing gene flow in genomic regions involved in ecological divergence. Unexpectedly, the nonrecombiningmating-type chromosomes showed lower divergence than autosomes due to higher gene flow, which may be promoted by adaptive introgressions of less degenerated mating-type chromosomes. The fact that both mating-type chromosomes are always heterozygous and nonrecombining may explain such patterns that oppose to those found for XY or ZW sex chromosomes. The specific features of mating-type chromosomes may also apply to the UV sex chromosomes determining sexes at the haploid stage in algae and bryophytes and may help test general hypotheses on the evolutionary specificities of sex-related chromosomes.

Choi, JY; Purugganan, M; Stacy, EA	Divergent Selection and Primary Gene Flow Shape Incipient Speciation of a Riparian Tree on Hawaii Island	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Metrosideros; sympatric speciation; ecological speciation; incipient speciation; gene flow; genomic islands of divergence	A long-standing goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of species. Of particular interest is whether or not speciation can occur in the presence of gene flow and without a period of physical isolation. Here, we investigated this process within Hawaiian Metrosideros, a hypervariable and highly dispersible woody species complex that dominates the Hawaiian Islands in continuous stands. Specifically, we investigated the origin of Metrosideros polymorpha var. newellii (newellii), a riparian ecotype endemic to Hawaii Island that is purportedly derived from the archipelago-wide M. polymorpha var. glaberrima (glaberrima). Disruptive selection across a sharp forestriparian ecotone contributes to the isolation of these varieties and is a likely driver of newellii's origin. We examined genome-wide variation of 42 trees from Hawaii Island and older islands. Results revealed a split between glaberrima and newellii within the past 0.3-1.2 My. Admixture was extensive between lineages within Hawaii Island and between islands, but introgression from populations on older islands (i.e., secondary gene flow) did not appear to contribute to the emergence of newellii. In contrast, recurrent gene flow (i.e., primary gene flow) between glaberrima and newellii contributed to the formation of genomic islands of elevated absolute and relative divergence. These regions were enriched for genes with regulatory functions as well as for signals of positive selection, especially in newellii, consistent with divergent selection underlying their formation. In sum, our results support riparian newellii as a rare case of incipient ecological speciation with primary gene flow in trees.

Wang, J; Street, NR; Park, EJ; Liu, JQ; Ingvarsson, PK	Evidence for widespread selection in shaping the genomic landscape during speciation of Populus	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	ancient introgression; incomplete lineage sorting; linked selection; phylogenetic relationship; Populus; recombination	Increasing our understanding of how evolutionary processes drive the genomic landscape of variation is fundamental to a better understanding of the genomic consequences of speciation. However, genome-wide patterns of within- and between- species variation have not been fully investigated in most forest tree species despite their global ecological and economic importance. Here, we use whole-genome resequencing data from four Populus species spanning the speciation continuum to reconstruct their demographic histories and investigate patterns of diversity and divergence within and between species. Using Populus trichocarpa as an outgroup species, we further infer the genealogical relationships and estimate the extent of ancient introgression among the three aspen species (Populus tremula, Populus davidiana and Populus tremuloides) throughout the genome. Our results show substantial variation in these patterns along the genomes with this variation being strongly predicted by local recombination rates and the density of functional elements. This implies that the interaction between recurrent selection and intrinsic genomic features has dramatically sculpted the genomic landscape over long periods of time. In addition, our findings provide evidence that, apart from background selection, recent positive selection and long-term balancing selection have also been crucial components in shaping patterns of genome-wide variation during the speciation process.

We used genome-wide markers to investigate the diversification of the Reunion grey white-eye (Zosterops borbonicus) on the small volcanic island of Reunion (Mascarene archipelago), where this species complex exhibits four geographical forms that are parapatrically distributed across the island and differ strikingly in plumage colour. One form restricted to the highlands is separated by a steep ecological gradient from three distinct lowland forms which meet at narrow hybrid zones that are not associated with environmental variables. Analyses of genomic variation based on single nucleotide polymorphism data from genotyping-by-sequencing and pooled RAD-seq approaches show that signatures of selection associated with elevation can be found at multiple regions across the genome, whereas most loci associated with the lowland forms are located on the Z sex chromosome. We identified TYRP1, a Z-linked colour gene, as a likely candidate locus underlying colour variation among lowland forms. Tests of demographic models revealed that highland and lowland forms diverged in the presence of gene flow, and divergence has progressed as gene flow was restricted by selection at loci across the genome. This system holds promise for investigating how adaptation and reproductive isolation shape the genomic landscape of divergence at multiple stages of the speciation process.

Hamlin, JAP; Hibbins, MS; Moyle, LC	Assessing biological factors affecting postspeciation introgression	EVOLUTION LETTERS	Geographic proximity; hybridization; mating system variation; Solanum; tomato; whole-genome	An increasing number of phylogenomic studies have documented a clear footprint of postspeciation introgression among closely related species. Nonetheless, systematic genome-wide studies of factors that determine the likelihood of introgression remain rare. Here, we propose an a priori hypothesis-testing framework that uses introgression statistics-including a new metric of estimated introgression, D-p-to evaluate general patterns of introgression prevalence and direction across multiple closely related species. We demonstrate this approach using whole genome sequences from 32 lineages in 11 wild tomato species to assess the effect of three factors on introgression-genetic relatedness, geographical proximity, and mating system differences-based on multiple trios within the ABBA-BABA test. Our analyses suggest each factor affects the prevalence of introgression, although our power to detect these is limited by the number of comparisons currently available. We find that of 14 species pairs with geographically proximate versus distant population comparisons, 13 showed evidence of introgression; in 10 of these cases, this was more prevalent between geographically closer populations. We also find modest evidence that introgression declines with increasing genetic divergence between lineages, is more prevalent between lineages that share the same mating system, and-when it does occur between mating systems-tends to involve gene flow from more inbreeding to more outbreeding lineages. Although our analysis indicates that recent postspeciation introgression is frequent in this group-detected in 15 of 17 tested trios-estimated levels of genetic exchange are modest (0.2-2.5% of the genome), so the relative importance of hybridization in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of these species could be limited. Regardless, similar clade-wide analyses of genomic introgression would be valuable for disentangling the major ecological, reproductive, and historical determinants of postspeciation gene flow, and for assessing the relative contribution of introgression as a source of genetic variation.

Cong, Q; Zhang, J; Shen, JH; Cao, XL; Brevignon, C; Grishin, NV	Speciation in North American Junonia from a genomic perspective	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY		Delineating species boundaries in phylogenetic groups undergoing recent radiation is a daunting challenge akin to discretizing continuity. Here, we propose a general approach exemplified by American butterflies from the genus Junonia Hubner notorious for the variety of similar phenotypes, ease of hybridization, and the lack of consensus about their classification. We obtain whole-genome shotgun sequences of about 200 specimens. We reason that discreteness emerges from continuity by means of a small number of key players, and search for the proteins that diverged markedly between sympatric populations of different species, while keeping low polymorphism within these species. Being 0.25% of the total number, these three dozen 'speciation' proteins indeed partition pairs of Junonia populations into two clusters with a prominent break in between, while all proteins taken together fail to reveal this discontinuity. Populations with larger divergence from each other, comparable to that between two sympatric species, form the first cluster and correspond to different species. The other cluster is characterized by smaller divergence, similar to that between allopatric populations of the same species and comprise conspecific pairs. Using this method, we conclude that J. genoveva (Cramer), J. litoralis Brevignon, J. evarete (Cramer), and J. divaricata C. & R. Felder are restricted to South America. We find that six species of Junonia are present in the United States, one of which is new: Junonia stemosa Grishin, sp.n. (i), found in south Texas and phenotypically closest to J. nigrosuffusa W. Barnes & McDunnough (ii) in its dark appearance. In the pale nudum of the antennal club, these two species resemble J. zonalis C. & R. Felder (iii) from Florida and the Caribbean Islands. The pair of sister species, J. grisea Austin & J. Emmel (iv) and J. coenia Hubner (v), represent the classic west/east U.S.A. split. The mangrove feeder (as caterpillar), dark nudum J. neildi Brevignon (vi) enters south Texas as a new subspecies Junonia neildi varia Grishin ssp.n. characterized by more extensive hybridization with and introgression from J. coenia, and, as a consequence, more variable wing patterns compared with the nominal J. n. neildi in Florida. Furthermore, a new mangrove-feeding species from the Pacific Coast of Mexico is described as Junonia pacoma Grishin sp.n. Finally, genomic analysis suggests that J. nigrosuffusa may be a hybrid species formed by the ancestors of J. grisea and J. stemosa sp.n. This published work has been registered on Zoobank, .

Chen, L; Wolf, AB; Fu, WQ; Li, LM; Akey, JM	Identifying and Interpreting Apparent Neanderthal Ancestry in African Individuals	CELL		Admixture has played a prominent role in shaping patterns of human genomic variation, including gene flow with now-extinct hominins like Neanderthals and Denisovans. Here, we describe a novel probabilistic method called IBDmix to identify introgressed hominin sequences, which, unlike existing approaches, does not use a modern reference population. We applied IBDmix to 2,504 individuals from geographically diverse populations to identify and analyze Neanderthal sequences segregating in modern humans. Strikingly, we find that African individuals carry a stronger signal of Neanderthal ancestry than previously thought. We show that this can be explained by genuine Neanderthal ancestry due to migrations back to Africa, predominately from ancestral Europeans, and gene flow into Neanderthals from an early dispersing group of humans out of Africa. Our results refine our understanding of Neanderthal ancestry in African and non-African populations and demonstrate that remnants of Neanderthal genomes survive in every modern human population studied to date.

Here we use graph clustering implemented in the RepeatExplorer (RE) pipeline to analyze homoeologous 5S rDNA arrays at the genomic level searching for hybridogenic origin of species. Data were obtained from more than 80 plant species, including several well-defined allopolyploids and homoploid hybrids of different evolutionary ages and from widely dispersed taxonomic groups. Results (i) Diploids show simple circular-shaped graphs of their 5S rDNA clusters. In contrast, most allopolyploids and other interspecific hybrids exhibit more complex graphs composed of two or more interconnected loops representing intergenic spacers (IGS). (ii) There was a relationship between graph complexity and locus numbers. (iii) The sequences and lengths of the 5S rDNA units reconstituted in silico from k-mers were congruent with those experimentally determined. (iv) Three-genomic comparative cluster analysis of reads from allopolyploids and progenitor diploids allowed identification of homoeologous 5S rRNA gene families even in relatively ancient (c. 1 Myr) Gossypium and Brachypodium allopolyploids which already exhibit uniparental partial loss of rDNA repeats. (v) Finally, species harboring introgressed genomes exhibit exceptionally complex graph structures. Conclusion We found that the cluster graph shapes and graph parameters (k-mer coverage scores and connected component index) well-reflect the organization and intragenomic homogeneity of 5S rDNA repeats. We propose that the analysis of 5S rDNA cluster graphs computed by the RE pipeline together with the cytogenetic analysis might be a reliable approach for the determination of the hybrid or allopolyploid plant species parentage and may also be useful for detecting historical introgression events.

Capblancq, T; Despres, A; Mavarez, J	Genetic, morphological and ecological variation across a sharp hybrid zone between two alpine butterfly species	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Alps; Coenonympha; genetic cline; hybrid zone; morphometrics; speciation	Identifying the mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of species is a central question in evolutionary biology, and distinguishing the selective drivers of populations' divergence from demographic processes is of particular interest to better understand the speciation process. Hybrid zones are recognized to provide ideal places to investigate the genetic architecture of speciation and to identify the mechanisms allowing diverging species to maintain their integrity in the face of gene flow. Here, we studied two alpine butterfly species, Coenonympha macromma and C. gardetta, which can be found flying together and hybridizing in narrow contact zones in the southern French Alps. We characterized the genomic composition of individuals, their morphology and their local habitat requirements, within and around a hybrid zone. Genetic diversity analysis at 794 SNPs revealed that all individuals within the hybrid zone were highly admixed, which was not the case outside the hybrid zone. Cline analysis showed that, despite ongoing hybridization, 56 out of 122 loci differentially fixed or nearly so between the two species were impermeable to introgression across the sharp hybrid zone (9 km wide). We also found concordance in cline position and width among genetic, morphological and environmental variation, suggesting a coupling of different reproductive barriers. Habitat characteristics such as the presence of trees and shrubs and the start of the growing season were strongly associated with the genetic variation, and we found evidence of divergence at genetic markers associated with morphology and physiology, putatively involved in visual or environmental reproductive isolation. We discuss the various behavioural and ecological factors that might interplay to maintain current levels of divergence and gene flow between this species pair.

Ebersbach, J; Posso-Terranova, A; Bogdanowicz, S; Gomez-Diaz, M; Garcia-Gonzalez, MX; Bolivar-Garcia, W; Andres, J	Complex patterns of differentiation and gene flow underly the divergence of aposematic phenotypes in Oophaga poison frogs	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	conservation; endangered species; genomics; hybrid zones	Hybridization and introgression can have complex consequences for both species evolution and conservation. Here, we investigated the origin and characteristics of a putative hybrid zone between two South American poison dart frog species, Oophaga anchicayensis and the critically endangered Oophaga lehmanni, which are heavily sought after on the illegal pet market. Using a combination of phenotypic (49 traits) and genomic (ddRADseq) data, we found that the putative hybrids are morphologically distinct from their parental species and confirmed genomic signatures of admixture in these populations. Several lines of evidence (hybrid indices, interspecific hybrid heterozygosity, genomic clines, comparisons with simulated hybrids and demographic modelling) support the conclusion that these populations are not comprised of early-generation hybrids and thus, they probably did not arise as a result of illegal translocations associated with wildlife trafficking. Instead, they probably represent an independent lineage which has persisted through isolation and has only relatively recently re-established gene flow with both parental species. Furthermore, we detected signals of differential introgression from parental species into these hybrid populations which suggest relaxed stabilizing selection on these aposematic colour morphs, potentially via context-dependent female choice. These populations thus provide a fascinating window into the role of hybridization, isolation and female choice in the diversification of South American poison dart frogs. In addition, our results underline the importance of landscape conservation measures to protect, not only known localities of nominal species, but also the phenotypic and genomic variation harbored by admixed lineages which represent crucial repositories for the impressive diversity in this system.

Thanou, E; Kornilios, P; Lymberakis, P; Leache, AD	Genomic and mitochondrial evidence of ancient isolations and extreme introgression in the four-lined snake	CURRENT ZOOLOGY	Aegean Islands; Elaphe quatuorlineata species-tree; genome-wide SNPs; mitochondrial introgression; phylogeography; refugia within refugia	Comparing mitochondrial and genomic phylogenies is an essential tool for investigating speciation processes, because each genome carries different inheritance properties and evolutionary characteristics. Furthermore, mitonuclear discordance may arise from ecological adaptation, historic isolation, population size changes, and sex-biased dispersal. Closely related taxa are expected to experience gene flow; however, this may not be true for insular populations or populations isolated in refugia. The four-lined snake Elaphe quatuorlineata has a fragmented distribution, separating populations of the Italian and Balkan Peninsulas, whereas several insular Aegean populations of significantly smaller body size (Cyclades island group and Skyros Island, Greece) are currently considered distinct subspecies. We constructed the species-tree phylogeny of this species utilizing genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and a gene-tree based on complete cytochrome b sequences, aiming to detect convergence and discrepancies between biparentally and maternally inherited genomes. Population structuring, phylogenetic patterns and migration events among geographically defined lineages supported our hypothesis of isolation in multiple sub-refugia. Where biogeographical barriers did not restrict subsequent dispersal, extensive genetic exchange occurred between mainland Balkan populations. This process has led to the mitochondrial sweep of an ancestral mitolineage that survived only in peripheral (East Greece) and insular populations (North Cyclades and Skyros). The Central Cyclades represent an ancient lineage for both molecular markers that emerged almost 3.3 Mya. Considering their distinct morphology, insular E. quatuorlineata populations should be the future focus of an extensive sampling, especially since the mitonuclear discordance observed in this species could be related to ecological adaptations, such as the island-dwarfism phenomenon.

Amundson, KR; Ordonez, B; Santayana, M; Tan, EH; Henry, IM; Mihovilovich, E; Bonierbale, M; Comai, L	Genomic Outcomes of Haploid Induction Crosses in Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)	GENETICS	aneuploidy; copy number variation; genome elimination; SNP analysis	The challenges of breeding autotetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum) have motivated the development of alternative breeding strategies. A common approach is to obtain uniparental dihaploids from a tetraploid of interest through pollination with S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (formerly S. phureja) cultivars. The mechanism underlying haploid formation of these crosses is unclear, and questions regarding the frequency of paternal DNA transmission remain. Previous reports have described aneuploid and euploid progeny that, in some cases, displayed genetic markers from the haploid inducer (HI). Here, we surveyed a population of 167 presumed dihaploids for large-scale structural variation that would underlie chromosomal addition from the HI, and for small-scale introgression of genetic markers. In 19 progeny, we detected 10 of the 12 possible trisomies and, in all cases, demonstrated the noninducer parent origin of the additional chromosome. Deep sequencing indicated that occasional, short-tract signals appearing to be of HI origin were better explained as technical artifacts. Leveraging recurring copy number variation patterns, we documented subchromosomal dosage variation indicating segregation of polymorphic maternal haplotypes. Collectively, 52% of the assayed chromosomal loci were classified as dosage variable. Our findings help elucidate the genomic consequences of potato haploid induction and suggest that most potato dihaploids will be free of residual pollinator DNA.

Prous, M; Lee, KM; Mutanen, M	Cross-contamination and strong mitonuclear discordance in Empria sawflies (Hymenoptera, Tenthredinidae) in the light of phylogenomic data	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	COI barcoding; ddRAD sequencing; DNA barcode sharing; Phylogenomics; Species delimitation	In several sawfly taxa strong mitonuclear discordance has been observed, with nuclear genes supporting species assignments based on morphology, whereas the barcode region of the mitochondrial COI gene suggests different relationships. As previous studies were based on only a few nuclear genes, the causes and the degree of mitonuclear discordance remain ambiguous. Here, we obtained genomic-scale ddRAD data together with Sanger sequences of mitochondrial COI and two to three nuclear protein coding genes to investigate species limbs and mitonuclear discordance in two closely related species groups of the sawfly genus Empria. As found previously based on nuclear ITS and mitochondrial COI sequences, species are in most cases supported as monophyletic based on new nuclear data reported here, but not based on mitochondrial COI. This mitonuclear discordance can be explained by occasional mitochondrial introgression with little or no nuclear gene flow, a pattern that might be common in haplodiploid taxa with slowly evolving mitochondrial genomes. Some species in the E. immersa group are not recovered as monophyletic according to either mitochondrial or nuclear data, but this could partly be because of unresolved taxonomy. Preliminary analyses of ddRAD data did not recover monophyly of E. japonica within the E. longicornis group (three Sanger sequenced nuclear genes strongly supported monophyly), but closer examination of the data and additional Sanger sequencing suggested that both specimens were substantially (possibly 10-20% of recovered loci) cross-contaminated. A reason could be specimen identification tag jumps during sequencing library preparation that in previous studies have been shown to affect up to 2.5% of the sequenced reads. We provide an R script to examine patterns of identical loci among the specimens and estimate that the cross-contamination rate is not unusually high for our ddRAD dataset as a whole (based on counting of identical sequences in the immersa and longicornis groups, which are well separated from each other and probably do not hybridise). The high rate of cross-contamination for both E. japonica specimens might be explained by the small number of recovered loci (similar to 1000) compared to most other specimens ( > 10 000 in some cases) because of poor sequencing results. We caution against drawing unexpected biological conclusions when closely related specimens are pooled before sequencing and tagged only at one end of the molecule or at both ends using a unique combination of limbed number of tags (less than the number of specimens).

Silverside fishes (Odontesthes) in the region comprise a radiation of 19 marine and freshwater species that have been hypothesized on the basis of morphological or mitochondrial DNA data to have either transitioned repeatedly into continental waters from the sea or colonized marine habitats following freshwater diversification. New double digest restriction-site associated DNA data presented here provide a robust framework to investigate the biogeographical history of and habitat transitions in Odontesthes. We show that Odontesthes silversides originally diversified in the Pacific but independently colonized the Atlantic three times, producing three independent marine-to-freshwater transitions. Our results also indicate recent introgression of marine mitochondrial haplotypes into two freshwater clades, with more recurring instances of hybridization among Atlantic- versus Pacific-slope species. In Pacific freshwater drainages, hybridization with a marine species appears to be geographically isolated and may be related to glaciation events. Substantial structural differences of estuarine gradients between these two geographical areas may have influenced the frequency, intensity and evolutionary effects of hybridization events.

European cattle diversity is generally dominated by taurine cattle, although elevated levels of indicine ancestry have been recorded in several breeds from southern Europe. Here we use genome-wide high-density SNP genotyping data to investigate the taurine and indicine ancestry in southern European cattle, based on a dataset comprising 508 individuals from 23 cattle breeds of taurine, indicine and mixed ancestry, including three breeds from Central Italy known to exhibit the highest levels of indicine introgression among southern European breeds. Based on local genomic ancestry analyses, we reconstruct taurine and indicine ancestry genome-wide and along chromosomes. We scrutinise local genomic introgression signals and identify genomic regions that have introgressed from indicine into taurine cattle under positive selection, harbouring genes with functions related to body size and feed efficiency. These findings suggest that indicine-derived traits helped enhance Central Italian cattle through adaptive introgression. The identified genes could provide genomic targets for selection for improved cattle performance. Our findings elucidate the key role of adaptive introgression in shaping the phenotypic features of modern cattle, aided by cultural and livestock exchange among historic human societies.

Alternatively, the extent of introgression at phylogeographic transitions can provide a more direct test to assign candidate taxa into subspecies or species categories. Here, we compared phylogenetic versus hybrid zone approaches of species delimitation in two groups of frogs from the Western Mediterranean region (Discoglossus and Pelodytes), by using genomic data (ddRAD). In both genera, coalescent analyses recovered almost all nominal taxa as species. However, the least-diverged pairs D. g. galganoi/jeanneae and P. punctatus/hespericus admix over hundreds of kilometers, suggesting that they have not yet developed strong reproductive isolation and should be treated as conspecifics. In contrast, the comparatively older D. scovazzi/pictus and P. atlanticus/ibericus form narrow contact zones, consistent with species distinctiveness. Due to their complementarity, we recommend taxonomists to combine phylogenomics with hybrid zone analyses to scale the gray zone of speciation, i.e., the evolutionary window separating widely admixing lineages versus nascent reproductively isolated species. The radically different transitions documented here conform to the view that genetic incompatibilities accumulating with divergence generate a weak barrier to gene flow for long periods of time, until their effects multiply and the speciation process then advances rapidly. Given the variability of the gray zone among taxonomic groups, at least from our current abilities to measure it, we recommend to customize divergence thresholds within radiations to categorize lineages for which no direct test of speciation is possible.

We show that North American mallards may well be becoming a hybrid swarm due to interbreeding with domesticated game-farm mallards released for hunting. Next, to attain a historical perspective, we applied a bait-capture array targeting thousands of loci in century-old (1842-1915) and contemporary (2009-2010) mallard and American black duck (Anas rubripes) specimens. We conclude that American black ducks and mallards have always been closely related, with a divergence time of similar to 600,000 years before present, and likely evolved through prolonged isolation followed by limited bouts of gene flow (i.e., secondary contact). They continue to maintain genetic separation, a finding that overturns decades of prior research and speculation suggesting the genetic extinction of the American black duck due to contemporary interbreeding with mallards. Thus, despite having high rates of hybridization, actual gene flow is limited between mallards and American black ducks. Conversely, our historical and contemporary data confirm that the intensive stocking of game-farm mallards during the last similar to 100 years has fundamentally changed the genetic integrity of North America's wild mallard population, especially in the east. It thus becomes of great interest to ask whether the iconic North American mallard is declining in the wild due to introgression of maladaptive traits from domesticated forms. Moreover, we hypothesize that differential gene flow from domestic game-farm mallards into the wild mallard population may explain the overall temporal increase in differentiation between wild black ducks and mallards, as well as the uncoupling of genetic diversity and effective population size estimates across time in our results. Finally, our findings highlight how genomic methods can recover complex population histories by capturing DNA preserved in traditional museum specimens.

Battey, CJ	Evidence of linked selection on the Z chromosome of hybridizing hummingbirds	EVOLUTION	Evolutionary genomics; hybridization; introgression; migration; phylogeography; speciation	Levels of genetic differentiation vary widely along the genomes of recently diverged species. What processes cause this variation? Here, I analyze geographic population structure and genome-wide patterns of variation in the Rufous, Allen's, and Calliope Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus/Selasphorus sasin/Selasphorus calliope) and assess evidence that linked selection on the Z chromosome drives patterns of genetic differentiation in a pair of hybridizing species. Demographic models, introgression tests, and genotype clustering analyses support a reticulate evolutionary history consistent with divergence during the late Pleistocene followed by gene flow across migrant Rufous and Allen's Hummingbirds during the Holocene. Relative genetic differentiation (Fst) is elevated, and within-population diversity (pi) is depressed on the Z chromosome in all interspecific comparisons. The ratio of Z to autosomal within-population diversity is much lower than that expected from population size effects alone, and Tajima's D is depressed on the Z chromosome in S. rufus and S. calliope. These results suggest that conserved structural features of the genome play a prominent role in shaping genetic differentiation through the early stages of speciation in northern Selasphorus hummingbirds, and that the Z chromosome is a likely site of genes underlying behavioral and morphological variation in the group.

Nikolic, N; Liu, SL; Jacobsen, MW; Jonsson, B; Bernatchez, L; Gagnaire, PA; Hansen, MM	Speciation history of European (Anguilla anguilla) and American eel (A. rostrata), analysed using genomic data	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	allele frequency spectrum; Anguilla spp; PSMC; secondary contact; sympatric speciation; vicariance	Speciation in the ocean could differ from terrestrial environments due to fewer barriers to gene flow. Hence, sympatric speciation might be common, with American and European eel being candidates for exemplifying this. They show disjunct continental distributions on both sides of the Atlantic, but spawn in overlapping regions of the Sargasso Sea from where juveniles are advected to North American, European and North African coasts. Hybridization and introgression are known to occur, with hybrids almost exclusively observed in Iceland. Different speciation scenarios have been suggested, involving either vicariance or sympatric ecological speciation. Using RAD sequencing and whole-genome sequencing data from parental species and F1 hybrids, we analysed speciation history based on the joint allele frequency spectrum (JAFS) and pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) plots. JAFS supported a model involving a split without gene flow 150,000-160,000 generations ago, followed by secondary contact 87,000-92,000 generations ago, with 64% of the genome experiencing restricted gene flow. This supports vicariance rather than sympatric speciation, likely associated with Pleistocene glaciation cycles and ocean current changes. Whole-genome PSMC analysis of F1 hybrids from Iceland suggested divergence 200,000 generations ago and indicated subsequent gene flow rather than strict isolation. Finally, simulations showed that results from both approaches (JAFS and PSMC) were congruent. Hence, there is strong evidence against sympatric speciation in North Atlantic eels. These results reiterate the need for careful consideration of cases of possible sympatric speciation, as even in seemingly barrier-free oceanic environments palaeoceanographic factors may have promoted vicariance and allopatric speciation.

Wilde, BC; Rutherford, S; van der Merwe, M; Murray, ML; Rossetto, M	First example of hybridisation between two Australian figs (Moraceae)	AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	DArTseq; genomic; introgression; morphological Ficus	The chance discovery of an unusual Ficus specimen near Katherine in the Northern Territory prompted an investigation into hybridisation between two morphologically distinct endemic Australian sandpaper figs, Ficus aculeata A.Cunn. ex Miq. and F. coronulata Miq. In this study, genome-wide scans and morphological measurements were used to investigate the perceived hybridisation by using herbarium and freshly collected samples. Most of the putative hybrids displayed a wide variety of intermediate morphology and some individuals had characteristics consistent with the description of a third species, F. carpentariensis D.J.Dixon. Both genomic and morphometric results provided evidence of naturally occurring hybridisation events within Ficus. Additionally, the findings from this study showed possible taxonomic issues within the Northern Australian sandpaper figs that warrant further investigation.

van der Valk, T; Gonda, CM; Silegowa, H; Almanza, S; Sifuentes-Romero, I; Hart, TB; Hart, JA; Detwiler, KM; Guschanski, K	The Genome of the Endangered Dryas Monkey Provides New Insights into the Evolutionary History of the Vervets	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	genomics; conservation; introgression; guenons; genetic diversity; inbreeding	Genomic data can be a powerful tool for inferring ecology, behavior, and conservation needs of highly elusive species, particularly, when other sources of information are hard to come by. Here, we focus on the Dryas monkey (Cercopithecus dryas), an endangered primate endemic to the Congo Basin with cryptic behavior and possibly <250 remaining adult individuals. Using whole-genome sequencing data, we show that the Dryas monkey represents a sister lineage to the vervets (Chlorocebus sp.) and has diverged from them similar to 1.4 Ma with additional bidirectional gene flow similar to 750,000-similar to 500,000years ago that has likely involved the crossing of the Congo River. Together with evidence of gene flow across the Congo River in bonobos and okapis, our results suggest that the fluvial topology of the Congo River might have been more dynamic than previously recognized. Despite the presence of several homozygous loss-of-function mutations in genes associated with sperm mobility and immunity, we find high genetic diversity and low levels of inbreeding and genetic load in the studied Dryas monkey individual. This suggests that the current population carries sufficient genetic variability for long-term survival and might be larger than currently recognized. We thus provide an example of how genomic data can directly improve our understanding of highly elusive species.

Mai, D; Nalley, MJ; Bachtrog, D	Patterns of Genomic Differentiation in the Drosophila nasuta Species Complex	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	speciation; Drosophila; introgression	The Drosophila nasuta species complex contains over a dozen recently diverged species that are distributed widely across South-East Asia, and which shows varying degrees of pre- and postzygotic isolation. Here, we assemble a high-quality genome for D. albomicans using single-molecule sequencing and chromatin conformation capture, and draft genomes for 11 additional species and 67 individuals across the clade, to infer the species phylogeny and patterns of genetic diversity in this group. Our assembly recovers entire chromosomes, and we date the origin of this radiation similar to 2 Ma. Despite low levels of overall differentiation, most species or subspecies show clear clustering into their designated taxonomic groups using population genetics and phylogenetic methods. Local evolutionary history is heterogeneous across the genome, and differs between the autosomes and the X chromosome for species in the sulfurigaster subgroup, likely due to autosomal introgression. Our study establishes the nasuta species complex as a promising model system to further characterize the evolution of pre- and postzygotic isolation in this clade.

Hirase, S; Kokita, T; Nagano, AJ; Kikuchi, K	Genomic and phenotypic consequences of two independent secondary contact zones between allopatric lineages of the anadromous ice goby Leucopsarion petersii	HEREDITY		Genetic and phenotypic analyses of independent secondary contact zones between certain pairs of divergent populations offer powerful opportunities to assess whether the consequences vary with different environmental backgrounds. Populations of the ice goby Leucopsarion petersii are distributed throughout the Japanese archipelago and comprise genetically and phenotypically divergent groups in the Japan Sea and the Pacific Ocean. In particular, populations in the Japan Sea have a larger body size and numbers of vertebrae than those in the Pacific Ocean. Herein, we performed integrated analyses of genotypes and phenotypes of two independent secondary contact zones and investigated their consequences. Population genetic analyses revealed asymmetric introgression of the mitochondrial genome of either lineage relative to little admixture of nuclear genomes in both secondary contact zones. On phenotype analyses, vertebral numbers were clearly explained by nuclear genomic ancestry in both secondary contact zones, whereas body size was not, suggesting that a little introgression of nuclear genes regulates body size. Actually, we observed biased introgression of a candidate gene, neuropeptide Y (NPY), which potentially controls body size in the ice goby. Moreover, the body size changes in the introgressed populations possibly affect the introgression patterns of mitochondrial genomes across these zones. Collectively, our results demonstrated that genomic and phenotypic consequences of secondary contact varied in marine variable environments.

Williams, RC; Blanco, MB; Poelstra, JW; Hunnicutt, KE; Comeault, AA; Yoder, AD	Conservation genomic analysis reveals ancient introgression and declining levels of genetic diversity in Madagascar's hibernating dwarf lemurs	HEREDITY		Madagascar's biodiversity is notoriously threatened by deforestation and climate change. Many of these organisms are rare, cryptic, and severely threatened, making population-level sampling unrealistic. Such is the case with Madagascar's dwarf lemurs (genus Cheirogaleus), the only obligate hibernating primate. We here apply comparative genomic approaches to generate the first genome-wide estimates of genetic diversity within dwarf lemurs. We generate a reference genome for the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, Cheirogaleus medius, and use this resource to facilitate analyses of high-coverage (similar to 30x) genome sequences for wild-caught individuals representing species: C. sp. cf. medius, C. major, C. crossleyi, and C. sibreei. This study represents the largest contribution to date of novel genomic resources for Madagascar's lemurs. We find concordant phylogenetic relationships among the four lineages of Cheirogaleus across most of the genome, and yet detect a number of discordant genomic regions consistent with ancient admixture. We hypothesized that these regions could have resulted from adaptive introgression related to hibernation, indeed finding that genes associated with hibernation are present, though most significantly, that gene ontology categories relating to transcription are over-represented. We estimate levels of heterozygosity and find particularly low levels in an individual sampled from an isolated population of C. medius that we refer to as C. sp. cf. medius. Results are consistent with a recent decline in effective population size, which is evident across species. Our study highlights the power of comparative genomic analysis for identifying species and populations of conservation concern, as well as for illuminating possible mechanisms of adaptive phenotypic evolution.

Khan, G; Franco, FF; Silva, GAR; Bombonato, JR; Machado, M; Alonso, DP; Ribolla, PEM; Albach, DC; Moraes, EM	Maintaining genetic integrity with high promiscuity: Frequent hybridization with low introgression in multiple hybrid zones of Melocactus (Cactaceae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Cactaceae; Hybridization; ddRAD-Seq; Interspecific gene flow; Xeric enclaves; Diamantina Plateau	Hybridization and introgression between species in contact/hybrid zones provide important insight into the genetic and ecological mechanisms of speciation. Cactaceae represents the most important radiation of true succulent angiosperms in the New World. This diversification continues to date, with species experiencing few intrinsic barriers to gene flow and the frequent occurrence of natural hybridization. Here, we used RAD-Seq single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to investigate the genetic architecture of hybridization in four hybrid zones hosting Melocactus concinnus and four congeneric species (M. ernestii, M. glaucescens, M. paucispinus, and M. zehntneri). Our results revealed that M. concinnus is highly promiscuous in sympatric areas and hybridizes with various species distributed in Morro do Chapeu (Diamantina Plateau, Bahia), eastern Brazil. However, the contemporary genomic introgression among the investigated species is very low (c. 2-5%), confirming that even in the face of hybridization, Melocactus species maintain their genetic integrity. The genomic cline approach showed a large fraction of loci deviating from a model of neutral introgression, where most of the loci are consistent with selection favoring parental genotypes. Our results suggest the occurrence of weak premating but strong postmating reproductive isolation in the analyzed cactus species. Furthermore, as most of the Melocactus species are restricted in distribution, hybridization might negatively affect their integrity if hybrids replace the parental species.

Perpina, G; Rosello, S; Esteras, C; Beltran, J; Monforte, A; Cebolla-Cornejo, J; Pico, B	Analysis of aroma-related volatile compounds affected by 'Ginsen Makuwa' genomic regions introgressed in 'Vedrantais' melon background	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	Cucumis melo L.; Introgression line; Quality; Genomics; Metabolomics	Volatile profile of melon fruit from 25 introgression lines (ILs), developed by introgressing specific genomic regions from the Japanese cultivar 'Ginsen makuwa' (MAK) into the 'Charentais' recurrent genetic background of the cultivar 'Vedrantais' (VED), was characterized in two environments. Fifty-seven VOCs were identified by purge and trap extraction followed by chromatography-mass spectrometry. IL population was also genotyped by GBS with 2,146 SNP distributed throughout the melon genome to tag MAK introgressions. The aromatic profiles of both parents and their hybrid suggested the dominance of MAK alleles. MAK introgressions in the VED background in general reduced the accumulation of VOCs in fruit, mainly alkyl esters and apocarotenoids. The environmental effect was remarkable, although some ILs showed a volatile profile stability in both environments. Some ILs with specific MAK introgressions displayed specific VOC profiles. The joint analysis of VOC profiles and GBS genotypes allowed for the identification of candidate genes, such as MELO3C024886, a 4-coumarate:CoA ligase which can be involved in the eugenol pathway, and other genes previously reported to be involved in melon VOCs production from fatty acids, aminoacids or carotenoids (CmLOX18, CmAAT, CmBAMT, CmCRTISO1), whose MAK alleles introgressed on VED genetic background might change the Charentais VOC profile. Additionally, some ILs showed changes in VOC profiles due to pleiotropic effects of changes in other traits, such as the low levels of apocarotenoids in the two green fleshed ILs (CmOrCmOr genotype), associated to the lack of carotenoid precursors, and the new ester profile of the ILs with altered ripening pattern (likely due to the introgression of the MAK NAC factor MELO3C012215). The information generated about the candidate regions and genes will be of interest for further genetic studies, to optimize the use of MAK genetic resources in melon breeding, and also to develop new lines with Charentais background and novel aroma profiles.

Here we report the genetic basis of nitrogen-use efficiency associated with adaptation to local soils in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Using a panel of diverse rice germplasm collected from different ecogeographical regions, we performed a genome-wide association study on the tillering response to nitrogen-the trait that is most closely correlated with nitrogen-use efficiency in rice-and identified OsTCP19 as a modulator of this tillering response through its transcriptional response to nitrogen and its targeting to the tiller-promoting gene DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT)(3,4). A 29-bp insertion and/or deletion in the OsTCP19 promoter confers a differential transcriptional response and variation in the tillering response to nitrogen among rice varieties. The allele of OsTCP19 associated with a high tillering response to nitrogen is prevalent in wild rice populations, but has largely been lost in modern cultivars: this loss correlates with increased local soil nitrogen content, which suggests that it might have contributed to geographical adaptation in rice. Introgression of the allele associated with a high tillering response into modern rice cultivars boosts grain yield and nitrogen-use efficiency under low or moderate levels of nitrogen, which demonstrates substantial potential for rice breeding and the amelioration of negative environment effects by reducing the application of nitrogen to crops.

Burbrink, FT; Gehara, M; McKelvy, AD; Myers, EA	Resolving spatial complexities of hybridization in the context of the gray zone of speciation in North American ratsnakes (Pantherophis obsoletus complex)	EVOLUTION	Eastern Nearctic; migration; isolation; neural networks; reproductive isolation; cline; hybrid zone	Inferring the history of divergence between species in a framework that permits the presence of gene flow has been crucial for characterizing the gray zone of speciation, which is the period of time where lineages have diverged but have not yet achieved strict reproductive isolation. However, estimates of both divergence times and rates of gene flow often ignore spatial information, for example when considering the location and width of hybrid zones with respect to changes in the environment between lineages. Using population genomic data from the North American ratsnake complex (Pantherophis obsoletus), we connected phylogeographic estimates of lineage structure, migration, historical demography, and timing of divergence with hybrid zone dynamics. We examined the spatial context of diversification by linking migration and timing of divergence to the location and widths of hybrid zones. Artificial neural network approaches were applied to understand how landscape features and past climate have influenced population genetic structure among these lineages. We found that rates of migration between lineages were associated with the overall width of hybrid zones. Timing of divergence was not related to migration rate or hybrid zone width across species pairs but may be related to the number of alleles weakly introgressing through hybrid zones. This research underscores how incomplete reproductive isolation can be better understood by considering differential allelic introgression and the effects of historical and contemporary landscape features on the formation of lineages as well as overall genomic estimates of migration rates through time.

Major CD processes governing genetic flow include the cell cycle, DNA replication, chromosome packaging, epigenetic changes, transcription, posttranscriptional alterations, translation, and posttranslational modifications. The CD processes are tightly regulated in plants to maintain genetic integrity throughout the life cycle and to pass genetic materials to next generation. Engineering of various CD processes involved in gene regulation will accelerate crop improvement to feed the growing world population. CRISPR technology enables programmable editing of CD processes to alter DNA, RNA, or protein, which would have been impossible in the past. Here, an overview of recent advancements in CRISPR tool development and CRISPR- based CD modulations that expedite basic and applied plant research is provided. Furthermore, CRISPR applications in major thriving areas of research, such as gene discovery (allele mining and cryptic gene activation), introgression (de novo domestication and haploid induction), and application of desired traits beneficial to farmers or consumers (biotic/abiotic stress-resilient crops, plant cell factories, and delayed senescence), are described. Finally, the global regulatory policies, challenges, and prospects for CRISPR-mediated crop improvement are discussed.	MOL PLANT		10.1016/j.molp.2020.11.002	  			TRUE	TRUE	review paper	FALSE			FALSE

GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	Wild peanut; Breeding; Polyploidy; Disease resistance; Genomic variation; Arachis	Introgression of desirable traits from wild relatives plays an important role in crop improvement, as wild species have important characters such as high resistance to pests and pathogens. However, use of wild peanut relatives is challenging because almost all wild species are diploid and sexually incompatible with cultivated peanut, which is tetraploid (AABB genome type; 2n = 4x = 40). To overcome the ploidy barrier, we used 2 wild species to make a tetraploid with the same allotetraploid genome composition as cultivated peanut. Crosses were made between 2 diploid wild species, Arachis valida Krapov. and W.C. Greg. (BB genome; 2n = 2x = 20) and Arachis stenosperma Krapov. and W.C. Greg. (AA genome; 2n = 2x = 20). Cuttings from the diploid F-1 AB hybrid were treated with colchicine to induce chromosome doubling thus generating an induced allotetraploid. Chromosome counts confirmed polyploidy (AABB genome; 2n = 4x = 40). We named the new allotetraploid ValSten. Plants had well-developed fertile pollen, produced abundant seed and were sexually compatible with cultivated peanut. ValSten exhibits the same high resistance to early and late leaf spot and rust as its diploid parents. Notably, we observed morphological variations, including flower width and branch angles in the earliest generation (S-0) of allotetraploids. A SNP array was used to genotype 47 S-0 allotetraploids. The great majority of markers showed the additive allelic state from both parents (AABB). However, some loci were AAAA or BBBB, indicating homeologous recombination. ValSten provides a new, vigorous, highly fertile, disease resistant germplasm for peanut research and improvement.

Knowledge of the mechanisms implicated in meiosis can contribute to facilitating the transfer of desirable traits from related species into a crop like wheat in the framework of breeding. It is particularly interesting to shed light on the mechanisms controlling correct pairing between homologous (equivalent) chromosomes and recombination, even more in polyploid species. The Ph1 (Pairing homoeologous 1) locus is implicated in recombination. In this work, we aimed to study whether homoeologous (equivalent chromosomes from different genomes) Hordeum chilense (wild barley) and H. vulgare (cultivated barley) chromosomes can associate and recombine during meiosis in the wheat background in the absence of the Ph1 locus. For this, we have developed H. chilense and H. vulgare double monosomic addition lines for the same and for different homoeology group in wheat in the ph1b mutant background. Using genomic in situ hybridization, we visualized the two (wild and cultivated) barley chromosomes during meiosis and we studied the processes of recognition, association, and recombination between homoeologous chromosomes in the absence of the Ph1 locus. Our results showed that the Ph1 locus does not prevent homoeologous chromosome pairing but it can regulate recombination.

In early 2000, an introgression line (IL) population of the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites (SH) acc. LA1777 was developed and made publicly available. Despite the potentiality of the donor parent, so far, these lines have been poorly explored for their agronomic performance and for the identification of genomic regions underlying the variation of quantitative traits (QTLs). Here, we report the evaluation of 19 morpho-agronomic and chemical traits on a set of 39 ILs grown in three consecutive field seasons with the aim to: (a) Determine the overall phenotypic performances of the studied collection, (b) estimate the influence of the genotype (G) and the year of cultivation (Y) and their interaction on the traits analyzed, (c) investigate the plasticity of the traits, and (d) identify whole-genome QTLs in the wild SH background. The ILs showed lower productivity compared to the control genotype, while no major effects were found for the morphological fruit-related traits. Instead, a general increase in the soluble solids content was observed. The combined analysis of G x Y highlighted a major effect of the genotype on trait variation, although yield-related traits were more influenced by environmental factors. In total, 75 associations for 17 traits were detected. Major QTLs increasing soluble solids, pericarp thickness, and trichome density were respectively found on chromosomes 1, 5, and 11 with a percentage variation (PV) of 24.01%, 32.49%, and 200%. Furthermore, different QTLs increasing the color intensity and fruit shape were detected. These results suggest that SH could be a potential source of favorable alleles for qualitative traits despite its inferior phenotype compared to the cultivated parent. The evaluated set of SH LA1777 ILs is a potential for novel allele discovery in wild tomatoes and for breeding purposes towards the exploitation of the available introgressions and for the pyramiding of traits.

Jiao, XY; Yang, ZH	Defining Species When There is Gene Flow	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	Gene flow; introgression; migration; multispecies coalescent; species concept; species delimitation	Whatever one's definition of species, it is generally expected that individuals of the same species should be genetically more similar to each other than they are to individuals of another species. Here, we show that in the presence of cross-species gene flow, this expectation may be incorrect. We use the multispecies coalescent model with continuous-time migration or episodic introgression to study the impact of gene flow on genetic differences within and between species and highlight a surprising but plausible scenario in which different population sizes and asymmetrical migration rates cause a genetic sequence to be on average more closely related to a sequence from another species than to a sequence from the same species. Our results highlight the extraordinary impact that even a small amount of gene flow may have on the genetic history of the species. We suggest that contrasting long-term migration rate and short-term hybridization rate, both of which can be estimated using genetic data, may be a powerful approach to detecting the presence of reproductive barriers and to define species boundaries.

Faria, R; Johannesson, K; Stankowski, S	Speciation in marine environments: Diving under the surface	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	demographic history; dispersal; effective population size; gene flow; genomic architecture; geographic isolation; hybridization; interdisciplinary research; natural selection; reproductive barriers	Marine environments are inhabited by a broad representation of the tree of life, yet our understanding of speciation in marine ecosystems is extremely limited compared with terrestrial and freshwater environments. Developing a more comprehensive picture of speciation in marine environments requires that we 'dive under the surface' by studying a wider range of taxa and ecosystems is necessary for a more comprehensive picture of speciation. Although studying marine evolutionary processes is often challenging, recent technological advances in different fields, from maritime engineering to genomics, are making it increasingly possible to study speciation of marine life forms across diverse ecosystems and taxa. Motivated by recent research in the field, including the 14 contributions in this issue, we highlight and discuss six axes of research that we think will deepen our understanding of speciation in the marine realm: (a) study a broader range of marine environments and organisms; (b) identify the reproductive barriers driving speciation between marine taxa; (c) understand the role of different genomic architectures underlying reproductive isolation; (d) infer the evolutionary history of divergence using model-based approaches; (e) study patterns of hybridization and introgression between marine taxa; and (f) implement highly interdisciplinary, collaborative research programmes. In outlining these goals, we hope to inspire researchers to continue filling this critical knowledge gap surrounding the origins of marine biodiversity.

In this study, we performed admixture and genetic relatedness analysis of northern highbush (NHB, primarily V. corymbosum) and southern highbush (SHB, V. corymbosum introgressed with V. darrowii, V. virgatum, or V. tenellum) blueberry genotypes, and progenies of the BNJ16-5 cross (V. corymbosum x V. darrowii). Using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we generated more than 334 million reads (75 bp). The GBS reads were aligned to the V. corymbosum cv. Draper v1.0 reference genome sequence, and similar to 2.8 million reads were successfully mapped. From the alignments, we identified 2,244,039 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were used for principal component, haplotype, and admixture analysis. Principal component analysis revealed three main groups: (1) NHB cultivars, (2) SHB cultivars, and (3) BNJ16-5 progenies. The overall fixation index (F-ST) and nucleotide diversity for NHB and SHB cultivars indicated wide genetic differentiation, and haplotype analysis revealed that SHB cultivars are more genetically diverse than NHB cultivars. The admixture analysis identified a mixture of various lineages of parental genomic introgression. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of GBS-derived single-nucleotide polymorphism markers in genetic and admixture analyses to reveal genetic relatedness and to examine parental lineages in blueberry, which may be useful for future breeding plans.

Wang, LY; He, SP; Dia, S; Sun, GF; Liu, XY; Wang, XY; Pan, Z; Jia, YH; Wang, LR; Pang, BY; Sun, XZ; Song, XL; Du, XM	Alien genomic introgressions enhanced fiber strength in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS	Upland cotton; Fiber quality; Segregation distortion; Introgression	Cotton (Gossypium) is a worldwide natural fiber crop. Fiber quality improvement lags far behind that of fiber yield. Although interspecific hybridization contributes significantly to improve fiber quality, the mechanism of alien genomic introgression to improve fiber quality has rarely been reported. In this study, a superior fiber strength line (J02-508) derived from interspecific hybridization was used to dissect the genetic and genomic bases for fiber quality by forward-genetics technologies. Both F-2 and F-2:5 populations were developed from a cross between superior line J02-508 and a weak fiber-quality line (ZRI015). Based on the linkage map constructed from the F-2:5 population, 27 stable quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected for fiber yield and quality. Unexpectedly, an abnormally high segregation distortion ratio was found for all chromosomes (reaching an average of 83.13 % for each chromosome), and the highest ratio of segregation distortion markers (SDMs) was on chromosome D08, reaching 99.39 %. Taking the SDMs into account, a distinct genome region on chromosome D08 was identified, which had a sizeable physical interval (similar to 53 Mb length) with low recombination frequency and was significantly associated with fiber strength (named qFS_D08, LOD value = 11.49). Additionally, by integrating different approaches, we initially confirmed that this region was an alien fragment introgressed from wild diploid cotton, G. thurberi (D1), accounting for nearly 77 % of the length of chromosome D08 in the J02-508 genome. We provided molecular evidence for fiber strength improvement caused by introgression. This study is also beneficial to understand the importance of interspecific hybridization for improving fiber strength during cotton breeding.

Liu, MS; Tseng, SH; Chen, TC; Chung, MC	Visualizing Meiotic Chromosome Pairing and Segregation in Interspecific Hybrids of Rice by Genomic in situ Hybridization	RICE SCIENCE	Oryza; wide hybridization; genomic affinity; allosyndesis; autosyndesis; pollen viability	Meiotic disturbances in F-1 hybrids and their progenies are still major problems in wide hybridization. To investigate the genome affinity reflected in chromosome pairing and segregation, we studied chromosome behaviors during meiosis in two interspecific F-1 hybrids [O. minuta x O. australiensis (Om x Oa, BCE genome) and Oa x O. ridleyi (Or, EHJ genome)] by using both traditional staining methods and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). GISH analysis has been successfully performed on mitotic chromosomes to distinguish different Oryza genomes, but relatively fewer systematic analyses of meiotic chromosomes of interspecific hybrids have been reported. In the hybrids, highly irregular chromosome behaviors through meiosis resulted in producing microspores with unbalanced genome. At diakinesis of these two hybrids, most chromosomes present as univalent, with low frequency as bivalents and occasionally as trivalents. In a pollen mother cell, 2 to 8 bivalents and 0 to 4 trivalents were observed in the hybrid Oa x Or, and 1 to 8 bivalents and 0 to 5 trivalents were observed in the hybrid Om x Oa. GISH results indicated that 51.52% bivalents in Oa x Or and 79.65% bivalents in Om x Oa involved allosyndetic association, which indicates that recombination and introgression should be possible if viable backcrosses can be recovered even from triploid hybrids. In this study, we revealed that the meiotic disturbance due to low affinities between parental genomes is the major reason for the sterility of these two triploid interspecific hybrids. The two hybrids showing vigor in reproductive growth are potential genetic resources in future breeding programs. A better understanding of genomic affinities between these distant Oryza species can facilitate planning an effective breeding program by using wide hybridization, and efficient and routine GISH analysis is helpful to monitor alien introgression in the process.

Typical genotyping datasets may have thousands to millions of data points per accession, across tens to thousands of accessions. There is a need for tools to help rapidly explore such datasets, to assess characteristics such as overall differences between accessions and regional anomalies across the genome.ResultsWe present GCViT (Genotype Comparison Visualization Tool), for visualizing and exploring large genotyping datasets. GCViT can be used to identify introgressions, conserved or divergent genomic regions, pedigrees, and other features for more detailed exploration. The program can be used online or as a local instance for whole genome visualization of resequencing or SNP array data. The program performs comparisons of variants among user-selected accessions to identify allele differences and similarities between accessions and a user-selected reference, providing visualizations through histogram, heatmap, or haplotype views. The resulting analyses and images can be exported in various formats.ConclusionsGCViT provides methods for interactively visualizing SNP data on a whole genome scale, and can produce publication-ready figures. It can be used in online or local installations. GCViT enables users to confirm or identify genomics regions of interest associated with particular traits.GCViT is freely available at https://github.com/LegumeFederation/gcvit.

We quantified the effects of non-native rainbow trout admixture on important life-history traits including growth and partial migration behavior in three populations of westslope cutthroat trout over five years. Rainbow trout admixture was associated with increased summer growth rates in all populations and decreased spring growth rates in two populations with cooler spring temperatures. These results indicate that non-native admixture may increase growth under warmer conditions, but cutthroat trout have higher growth rates during cooler periods. Non-native admixture consistently increased expression of migratory behavior, suggesting that there is a genomic basis for life-history differences between these species. Our results show that effects of interspecific hybridization on fitness traits can be the product of genotype-by-environment interactions even when there are minor differences in environmental optima between hybridizing species. These results also indicate that while environmentally mediated traits like growth may play a role in population-level consequences of admixture, strong genetic influences on migratory life-history differences between these species likely explains the continued spread of non-native hybridization at the landscape-level, despite selection against hybrids at the population-level.

Leal, BSS; Brandao, MM; Palma-Silva, C; Pinheiro, F	Differential gene expression reveals mechanisms related to habitat divergence between hybridizing orchids from the Neotropical coastal plains	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Ecological genomics; Edaphic adaptation; Neotropical speciation; Orchids; Restingas; Transcription profile	BackgroundClosely related hybridizing species are ideal systems for identifying genomic regions underlying adaptive divergence. Although gene expression plays a central role in determining ecologically-based phenotypic differences, few studies have inferred the role of gene expression for adaptive divergence in Neotropical systems. In this study, we conduct genome-wide expression analysis alongside soil elemental analysis in sympatric and allopatric populations of Epidendrum fulgens and E. puniceoluteum (Orchidaceae), which occur in contrasting adjacent habitats in the Neotropical coastal plains.ResultsThese species were highly differentiated by their gene expression profiles, as determined by 18-21% of transcripts. Gene ontology (GO) terms associated with reproductive processes were enriched according to comparisons between species in both allopatric and sympatric populations. Species showed differential expression in genes linked to salt and waterlogging tolerance according to comparisons between species in sympatry, and biological processes related to environmental stimulus appeared as representative among those transcripts associated with edaphic characteristics in each sympatric zone. Hybrids, in their turn, were well differentiated from E. fulgens, but exhibited a similar gene expression profile to flooding-tolerant E. puniceolutem. When compared with parental species, hybrids showed no transcripts with additive pattern of expression and increased expression for almost all transgressive transcripts.ConclusionsThis study sheds light on general mechanisms promoting ecological differentiation and assortative mating, and suggests candidate genes, such as those encoding catalase and calcium-dependent protein kinase, underling adaptation to harsh edaphic conditions in the Neotropical coastal plains. Moreover, it demonstrates that differential gene expression plays a central role in determining ecologically-based phenotypic differences among co-occurring species and their hybrids.

Tennessen, JA; Ingham, VA; Toe, KH; Guelbeogo, WM; Sagnon, N; Kuzma, R; Ranson, H; Neafsey, DE	A population genomic unveiling of a new cryptic mosquito taxon within the malaria-transmitting Anopheles gambiae complex	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	admixture; Anopheles; cryptic taxa; reproductive barrier; selective sweep; vector	The Anopheles gambiae complex consists of multiple morphologically indistinguishable mosquito species including the most important vectors of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in sub-Saharan Africa. Nine cryptic species have been described so far within the complex. The ecological, immunological and reproductive differences among these species will critically impact population responses to disease control strategies and environmental changes. Here, we examine whole-genome sequencing data from a longitudinal study of putative A. coluzzii in western Burkina Faso. Surprisingly, many specimens are genetically divergent from A. coluzzii and all other Anopheles species and represent a new taxon, here designated Anopheles TENGRELA (AT). Population genetic analysis suggests that the cryptic GOUNDRY subgroup, previously collected as larvae in central Burkina Faso, represents an admixed population descended from both A. coluzzii and AT. AT harbours low nucleotide diversity except for the 2La inversion polymorphism which is maintained by overdominance. It shows numerous fixed differences with A. coluzzii concentrated in several regions reflecting selective sweeps, but the two taxa are identical at standard diagnostic loci used for taxon identification, and thus, AT may often go unnoticed. We present an amplicon-based genotyping assay for identifying AT which could be usefully applied to numerous existing samples. Misidentified cryptic taxa could seriously confound ongoing studies of Anopheles ecology and evolution in western Africa, including phenotypic and genotypic surveys of insecticide resistance. Reproductive barriers between cryptic species may also complicate novel vector control efforts, for example gene drives, and hinder predictions about evolutionary dynamics of Anopheles and Plasmodium.

Smolinsky, R; Balaz, V; Nurnberger, B	Tadpoles of hybridising fire-bellied toads (B. bombina and B. variegata) differ in their susceptibility to predation	PLOS ONE		The role of adaptive divergence in the formation of new species has been the subject of much recent debate. The most direct evidence comes from traits that can be shown to have diverged under natural selection and that now contribute to reproductive isolation. Here, we investigate differential adaptation of two fire-bellied toads (Anura, Bombinatoridae) to two types of aquatic habitat. Bombina bombina and B. variegata are two anciently diverged taxa that now reproduce in predator-rich ponds and ephemeral aquatic sites, respectively. Nevertheless, they hybridise extensively wherever their distribution ranges adjoin. We show in laboratory experiments that, as expected, B. variegata tadpoles are at relatively greater risk of predation from dragonfly larvae, even when they display a predator-induced phenotype. These tadpoles spent relatively more time swimming and so prompted more attacks from the visually hunting predators. We argue in the discussion that genomic regions linked to high activity in B. variegata should be barred from introgression into the B. bombina gene pool and thus contribute to gene flow barriers that keep the two taxa from merging into one.

Important prerequisites are large populations that are genomically analyzed by medium- to high-density marker arrays and extensive phenotyping across locations and years of the same populations. The latter is important to train a genomic model that is used to predict genomic estimated breeding values of phenotypically untested genotypes. After reviewing the specific features of quantitative resistances and the basic genomic techniques, the possibilities for genomics-assisted breeding are evaluated for six pathosystems with hemi-biotrophic fungi: Small-grain cereals/Fusarium head blight (FHB), wheat/Septoria tritici blotch (STB) and Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB), maize/Gibberella ear rot (GER) and Fusarium ear rot (FER), maize/Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB). Typically, all quantitative disease resistances are caused by hundreds of QTL scattered across the whole genome, but often available in hotspots as exemplified for NCLB resistance in maize. Because all crops are suffering from many diseases, multi-disease resistance (MDR) is an attractive aim that can be selected by specific MDR QTL. Finally, the integration of genomic data in the breeding process for introgression of genetic resources and for the improvement within elite materials is discussed.

Prior phylogenetic analyses on Euclidieae are inadequate. In this study, sequence data from the plastid genome and nuclear ribosomal DNA of 72 species in 27 genera of Euclidieae were used to infer the inter- and infra-generic relationships within. The well-resolved and strongly supported plastome phylogenies revealed that Euclidieae could be divided into five clades. Both Cymatocarpus and Neotorularia are polyphyletic in nuclear and plastome phylogenies. Besides, the conflicts of systematic positions of three species of Braya and two species of Solms-laubachia s.l. indicated that hybridization and or introgression might have happened during the evolutionary history of the tribe. Results from divergence-time analyses suggested an early Miocene origin of Euclidieae, and it probably originated from the Central Asia, Pamir Plateau and West Himalaya. In addition, multiple ndh genes loss and pseudogenization were detected in eight species based on comparative genomic study.

Hirase, S; Tezuka, A; Nagano, AJ; Sato, M; Hosoya, S; Kikuchi, K; Iwasaki, W	Integrative genomic phylogeography reveals signs of mitonuclear incompatibility in a natural hybrid goby population	EVOLUTION	Dobzhansky&#8208; Muller incompatibility; hybridization; microRNA; mitonuclear interactions; oxidative phosphorylation; secondary contact	Hybridization between divergent lineages generates new allelic combinations. One mechanism that can hinder the formation of hybrid populations is mitonuclear incompatibility, that is, dysfunctional interactions between proteins encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of diverged lineages. Theoretically, selective pressure due to mitonuclear incompatibility can affect genotypes in a hybrid population in which nuclear genomes and mitogenomes from divergent lineages admix. To directly and thoroughly observe this key process, we de novo sequenced the 747-Mb genome of the coastal goby, Chaenogobius annularis, and investigated its integrative genomic phylogeographics using RNA-sequencing, RAD-sequencing, genome resequencing, whole mitogenome sequencing, amplicon sequencing, and small RNA-sequencing. Chaenogobius annularis populations have been geographically separated into Pacific Ocean (PO) and Sea of Japan (SJ) lineages by past isolation events around the Japanese archipelago. Despite the divergence history and potential mitonuclear incompatibility between these lineages, the mitogenomes of the PO and SJ lineages have coexisted for generations in a hybrid population on the Sanriku Coast. Our analyses revealed accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions in the PO-lineage mitogenomes, including two convergent substitutions, as well as signals of mitochondrial lineage-specific selection on mitochondria-related nuclear genes. Finally, our data implied that a microRNA gene was involved in resolving mitonuclear incompatibility. Our integrative genomic phylogeographic approach revealed that mitonuclear incompatibility can affect genome evolution in a natural hybrid population.

Kumari, P; Singh, KP; Kumar, S; Yadava, DK	Development of a Yellow-Seeded Stable Allohexaploid Brassica Through Inter-Generic Somatic Hybridization With a High Degree of Fertility and Resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	inter-generic somatic hybridization; allohexaploids brassica; genomic in situ hybridization; seed color; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum resistance; Sinapis alba	The Brassica coenospeceis have treasure troves of genes that could be beneficial if introgressed into cultivated Brassicas to combat the current conditions of climate change. Introducing genetic variability through plant speciation with polyploidization is well documented, where ploidy augmentation of inter-generic allohexaploids using somatic hybridization has significantly contributed to genetic base broadening. Sinapis alba is a member of the Brassicaceae family that possesses valuable genes, including genes conferring resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Alternaria brassicae, pod shattering, heat, and drought stress. This work aimed to synthesize stable allohexaploid (AABBSS) Brassica while incorporating the yellow-seed trait and resistance to S. sclerotiorum stem rot. The two fertile and stable allohexaploids were developed by polyethylene glycol mediated protoplast fusions between Brassica juncea (AABB) and S. alba (SS) and named as JS1 and JS2. These symmetric hybrids (2n = 60) were validated using morphological and molecular cytology techniques and were found to be stable over consecutive generations. The complete chromosome constitution of the three genomes was determined through genomic in situ hybridization of mitotic cells probed with S. alba genomic DNA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. These two allohexaploids showed 24 hybridization signals demonstrating the presence of complete diploid chromosomes from S. alba and 36 chromosomes from B. juncea. The meiotic pollen mother cell showed 30 bivalent sets of all the 60 chromosomes and none of univalent or trivalent observed during meiosis. Moreover, the backcross progeny 1 plant revealed 12 hybridization signals out of a total of 48 chromosome counts. Proper pairing and separation were recorded at the meiotic metaphase and anaphase, which proved the stability of the allohexaploid and their backcross progeny. When screening, the allohexaploid (JS2) of B. juncea and S. alba displayed a high degree of resistance to S. sclerotiorum rot along with a half-yellow and half-brown (mosaic) seed coat color, while the B. juncea and S. alba allohexaplopid1 (JS1) displayed a yellow seed coat color with the same degree of resistance to Sclerotinia rot.

Shaibu, AS; Miko, ZL; Ajeigbe, HA; Mohammed, SG; Usman, A; Muhammad, MS; Umar, ML; Ahmed, HO; Adnan, AA; Sneller, C	Genome-wide detection of markers associated with early leaf spot and pod weight in groundnut using SNP and DArT markers	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT	DArT-seq (TM); early leaf spot; groundnut; marker-trait association; pod weight; single nucleotide polymorphism	Early leaf spot (ELS) disease, caused by Cercospora arachidicola S. Hori, severely affects groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) production worldwide. Breeding for resistant varieties using conventional breeding is difficult because multiple genes control the resistance and heritability is moderate. Our objective was to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) for ELS resistance in a mini-core collection of 168 accessions. The accessions were genotyped using diversity array technology (DArTseq (TM)) and phenotyped at two locations with and without inoculation. Two types of DArTseq markers were scored; Silico DArT markers and biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Genotype effects were significant for both ELS and pod weight (PW), with several accessions showing good levels for resistance. The heritability of ELS was moderate (0.37 to 0.64), whereas heritability for PW was low (0.10 to 0.18). The DArTseq generated 3592 biallelic SNP markers and 15,237 dominant silico markers. The distribution of the biallelic and dominant markers across the genome shows that chromosomes B04 and A04 had the highest number of markers. The MTA analysis revealed 25 significant (p < 0.001) MTAs. One MTA for ELS was found across treatments and rating dates and may be suitable for marker-assisted selection upon validation. No MTA for PW was repeatable. The germplasm and markers identified in this study can serve as useful genomic resources to initiate marker-assisted selection and trait introgression for ELS resistance in groundnut.

Lindl x E. deflexa (Hemsl.) Nakai	EUPHYTICA	Loquat; Bronze loquat; Interspecific hybridization; Allotriploid	A triploid was obtained from loquat (Eriobotrya japonica cv. 'Ninghaibai') (2n = 2x = 34) x bronze loquat (Eriobotrya deflexa, 2n = 2x = 34). The leaves of the triploid had no petioles, similar to the female parent, and its stipules were obvious and dark green, similar to those of the male parent. There were signals of male parent DNA on ten chromosomes of the triploid according to genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) when DNA of bronze loquat was used as probe; the diploid hybrid also had ten chromosomes with signals of male parent DNA. All five selected simple sequence repeats (SSR) primers amplified specific loci of both parents. In particular, primer CH04c06 amplified both specific loci of the female parent but only amplified one specific locus of the male parent. The results of GISH and SSR marker analysis indicated that the 2n gamete which formed the triploid was from first-division restitution or pre-meiotic doubling of the female parent cv. 'Ninghaibai'. The allotriploid can be used to breed seedless loquat germplasm with different flowering times from loquat directly or to breed new germplasm containing a few genomic components from bronze loquat, such as monosomic alien addition lines, monosomic alien substitution lines, and introgression lines. This is the first report of allotriploid in the genus Eriobotrya and it will provide a basis for breeding new loquat germplasms by distant hybridization and provide an ideal material for breeding new loquat varieties with different flowering time or time to maturity.

Genome introgressions drive evolution across the animal(1), plant(2) and fungal(3) kingdoms. Introgressions initiate from archaic admixtures followed by repeated backcrossing to one parental species. However, how introgressions arise in reproductively isolated species, such as yeast(4), has remained unclear. Here we identify a clonal descendant of the ancestral yeast hybrid that founded the extant Saccharomyces cerevisiae Alpechin lineage(5), which carries abundant Saccharomyces paradoxus introgressions. We show that this clonal descendant, hereafter defined as a 'living ancestor', retained the ancestral genome structure of the first-generation hybrid with contiguous S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus subgenomes. The ancestral first-generation hybrid underwent catastrophic genomic instability through more than a hundred mitotic recombination events, mainly manifesting as homozygous genome blocks generated by loss of heterozygosity. These homozygous sequence blocks rescue hybrid fertility by restoring meiotic recombination and are the direct origins of the introgressions present in the Alpechin lineage. We suggest a plausible route for introgression evolution through the reconstruction of extinct stages and propose that genome instability allows hybrids to overcome reproductive isolation and enables introgressions to emerge.

Four perennial wheat lines SX12-480, SX12-787, SX12-1150, and SX12-1269 were developed from a series of interspecific crosses between common wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 42) or durum wheat (T. turgidum var. durum, 2n = 28) and the intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium, 2n = 42). These lines were characterized by the vigorous regrowth for at least 3 years. The one- and 2-year-old plants had higher grain yield potential than the 3-year-old perennial plants. The decline of grain yield was associated with plant age-related effects on yield components. The perennial wheat lines were all resistant to both Heterodera avenae and H. filipjevi, the two distinct cereal cyst nematode species that occur in China, except that line SX12-787 exhibited moderate resistance only to H. avenae. The dual-purpose perennial wheat lines were evaluated for quality values of both defoliated grass and harvested grains in the form of amino acid profile, mineral concentration, and contents of protein and fiber. Difference in the quality profile was observed between the perennial lines. These perennial lines had an overall improved quality levels over those of the perennial wheat control Montana-2 (T. turgidum x Th. intermedium) and the annual wheat cultivar Jinchun 9. The amplification profiles of the molecular markers provided molecular evidence for the introgression of alien chromatin. Genomic in situ hybridization detected 16, 14, 14, and 12 Th. intermedium chromosomes in lines SX12-480 (2n = 48), SX12-787 (2n = 56), SX12-1150 (2n = 56), and SX12-1269 (2n = 54), respectively, in addition to either 32 or the complete set of wheat chromosomes. The four perennial wheat-Th. intermedium lines described here provide valuable sources of perennial wheat for the dual-purpose application of both grain and forage.

Although these traits have been recently linked with the maintenance of a high genetic variation within natural populations, the factors underlying the evolutionary success of this species remain unclear. Results Here, after the assembly of a 1.28-Gb reference genome and the resequencing of 14 individuals from two independent populations, we reveal a complex pan-genomic architecture in M. galloprovincialis, with a core set of 45,000 genes plus a strikingly high number of dispensable genes (20,000) subject to presence-absence variation, which may be entirely missing in several individuals. We show that dispensable genes are associated with hemizygous genomic regions affected by structural variants, which overall account for nearly 580 Mb of DNA sequence not included in the reference genome assembly. As such, this is the first study to report the widespread occurrence of gene presence-absence variation at a whole-genome scale in the animal kingdom. Conclusions Dispensable genes usually belong to young and recently expanded gene families enriched in survival functions, which might be the key to explain the resilience and invasiveness of this species. This unique pan-genome architecture is characterized by dispensable genes in accessory genomic regions that exceed by orders of magnitude those observed in other metazoans, including humans, and closely mirror the open pan-genomes found in prokaryotes and in a few non-metazoan eukaryotes.

Schreiber, D; Pfenninger, M	Genomic divergence landscape in recurrently hybridizing Chironomus sister taxa suggests stable steady state between mutual gene flow and isolation	EVOLUTION LETTERS	Admixture inference; islands of divergence; reproductive isolation; speciation	Divergence is mostly viewed as a progressive process often initiated by selection targeting individual loci, ultimately resulting in ever increasing genomic isolation due to linkage. However, recent studies show that this process may stall at intermediate stable equilibrium states without achieving complete genomic isolation. We tested the extent of genomic isolation between two recurrently hybridizing nonbiting midge sister taxa, Chironomus riparius and Chironomus piger, by analyzing the divergence landscape. Using a principal component-based method, we estimated that only about 28.44% of the genomes were mutually isolated, whereas the rest was still exchanged. The divergence landscape was fragmented into isolated regions of on average 30 kb, distributed throughout the genome. Selection and divergence time strongly influenced lengths of isolated regions, whereas local recombination rate only had minor impact. Comparison of divergence time distributions obtained from several coalescence-simulated divergence scenarios with the observed divergence time estimates in an approximate Bayesian computation framework favored a short and concluded divergence event in the past. Most divergence happened during a short time span about 4.5 million generations ago, followed by a stable equilibrium between mutual gene flow through ongoing hybridization for the larger part of the genome and isolation in some regions due to rapid purifying selection of introgression, supported by high effective population sizes and recombination rates.

Zhao, HH; Li, YJ; Petkowski, J; Kant, S; Hayden, MJ; Daetwyler, HD	Genomic prediction and genomic heritability of grain yield and its related traits in a safflower genebank collection	PLANT GENOME		Safflower, a minor oilseed crop, is gaining increased attention for food and industrial uses. Safflower genebank collections are an important genetic resource for crop enhancement and future breeding programs. In this study, we investigated the population structure of a safflower collection sourced from the Australian Grain Genebank and assessed the potential of genomic prediction (GP) to evaluate grain yield and related traits using single and multi-site models. Prediction accuracies (PA) of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) from single site models ranged from 0.21 to 0.86 for all traits examined and were consistent with estimated genomic heritability (h(2)), which varied from low to moderate across traits. We generally observed a low level of genome x environment interactions (g x E). Multi-site g x E GBLUP models only improved PA for accessions with at least some phenotypes in the training set. We observed that relaxing quality filtering parameters for genotype-by-sequencing (GBS), such as missing genotype call rate, did not affect PA but upwardly biased h(2) estimation. Our results indicate that GP is feasible in safflower evaluation and is potentially a cost-effective tool to facilitate fast introgression of desired safflower trait variation from genebank germplasm into breeding lines.

Huang, J; Flouri, T; Yang, ZH	A Simulation Study to Examine the Information Content in Phylogenomic Data Sets under the Multispecies Coalescent Model	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Bayesian inference; BPP; information content; multispecies coalescent; MSC; MSC with introgression; MSci	We use computer simulation to examine the information content in multilocus data sets for inference under the multispecies coalescent model. Inference problems considered include estimation of evolutionary parameters (such as species divergence times, population sizes, and cross-species introgression probabilities), species tree estimation, and species delimitation based on Bayesian comparison of delimitation models. We found that the number of loci is the most influential factor for almost all inference problems examined. Although the number of sequences per species does not appear to be important to species tree estimation, it is very influential to species delimitation. Increasing the number of sites and the per-sitemutation rate both increase the mutation rate for the whole locus and these have the same effect on estimation of parameters, but the sequence length has a greater effect than the per-site mutation rate for species tree estimation. We discuss the computational costs when the data size increases and provide guidelines concerning the subsampling of genomic data to enable the application of full-likelihood methods of inference.

Chukwu, SC; Rafii, MY; Ramlee, SI; Ismail, SI; Oladosu, Y; Muhammad, I; Musa, I; Ahmed, M; Jatto, MI; Yusuf, BR	Recovery of Recurrent Parent Genome in a Marker-Assisted Backcrossing Against Rice Blast and Blight Infections Using Functional Markers and SSRs	PLANTS-BASEL	Oryza sativa L; chromosome; introgression; microsatellites; foreground selection; background selection; RPGR	The most vital aspect of marker-assisted backcross breeding is the recurrent parent genome recovery. This enables the selection of only parents with recovered recipient/recurrent parent genome in addition to the targeted genes. The recurrent parent genome recovery (RPGR) ensures that non-desirable genomic segments are removed while the gene of interest is sustained in the recombined progenies without further segregations. This work was aimed at quantifying the RPGR of backcross populations with introgression of bacterial leaf blight resistance genes. Putra-1, a Malaysian elite variety, high yielding with inherent resistance to blast but susceptible to bacterial leaf blight (BLB), was crossed with IRBB60 which is resistant to BLB disease. The IRBB60 has four Xoo resistance genes-Xa4, xa5, xa13 and Xa21. Tightly linked polymorphic functional and SSR markers were used for foreground selection at every stage of backcrossing to select progenies with introgressed target genes. Background selection was done to quantify the percentage of RPGR in the selected lines using 79 confirmed polymorphic microsatellites. Result obtained showed that the percentage of RPGR was 80.11% at BC1F1, 95.30% at BC2F1 and 95.9% at BC2F2. The introgression of Xa4, xa5, xa13 and Xa21 Xoo resistance genes were faster through the adopted marker-assisted backcross breeding compared to what could be obtained through conventional breeding. All the 16 selected lines displayed resistance to BLB with three lines showing high resistance to the disease. The blast resistance contained in the genetic background of Putra-1 was also sustained in all the selected lines. The newly developed lines were recommended as new rice varieties for commercial cultivation.	PLANTS-BASEL		10.3390/plants9111411	  			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE
Gramazio, P; Pereira-Dias, L; Vilanova, S; Prohens, J; Soler, S; Esteras, J; Garmendia, A; Diez, MJ	Morphoagronomic characterization and whole-genome resequencing of eight highly diverse wild and weedy S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme accessions used for the first interspecific tomato MAGIC population	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH		The wild Solanum pimpinellifolium (SP) and the weedy S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme (SLC) are largely unexploited genetic reservoirs easily accessible to breeders, as they are fully cross-compatible with cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum var. lycopersicum). We performed a comprehensive morphological and genomic characterization of four wild SP and four weedy SLC accessions, selected to maximize the range of variation of both taxa. These eight accessions are the founders of the first tomato interspecific multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population. The morphoagronomic characterization was carried out with 39 descriptors to assess plant, inflorescence, fruit and agronomic traits, revealing the broad range of diversity captured. Part of the morphological variation observed in SP was likely associated to the adaptation of the accessions to different environments, while in the case of SLC to both human activity and adaptation to the environment. Whole-genome resequencing of the eight accessions revealed over 12 million variants, ranging from 1.2 to 1.9 million variants in SLC and from 3.1 to 4.8 million in SP, being 46.3% of them (4,897,803) private variants. The genetic principal component analysis also confirmed the high diversity of SP and the complex evolutionary history of SLC. This was also reflected in the analysis of the potential footprint of common ancestors or old introgressions identified within and between the two taxa. The functional characterization of the variants revealed a significative enrichment of GO terms related to changes in cell walls that would have been negatively selected during domestication and breeding. The comprehensive morphoagronomic and genetic characterization of these accessions will be of great relevance for the genetic analysis of the first interspecific MAGIC population of tomato and provides valuable knowledge and tools to the tomato community for genetic and genomic studies and for breeding purposes.

Marimon, N; Luque, J; Arus, P; Eduardo, I	Fine mapping and identification of candidate genes for the peach powdery mildew resistance gene Vr3	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH		Powdery mildew is one of the major diseases of peach (Prunus persica), caused by the ascomycete Podosphaera pannosa. Currently, it is controlled through calendar-based fungicide treatments starting at petal fall, but an alternative is to develop resistant peach varieties. Previous studies mapped a resistance gene (Vr3) in interspecific populations between almond ('Texas') and peach ('Earlygold'). To obtain molecular markers highly linked to Vr3 and to reduce the number of candidate genes, we fine-mapped Vr3 to a genomic region of 270kb with 27 annotated genes. To find evidence supporting one of these positional candidate genes as being responsible of Vr3, we analyzed the polymorphisms of the resequences of both parents and used near-isogenic lines (NILs) for expression analysis of the positional candidate genes in symptomatic or asymptomatic leaves. Genes differentially expressed between resistant and susceptible individuals were annotated as a Disease Resistance Protein RGA2 (Prupe2G111700) or an Eceriferum 1 protein involved in epicuticular wax biosynthesis (Prupe2G112800). Only Prupe2G111700 contained a variant predicted to have a disruptive effect on the encoded protein, and was overexpressed in both heterozygous and homozygous individuals containing the Vr3 almond allele, compared with susceptible individuals. This information was also useful to identify and validate molecular markers tightly linked and flanking Vr3. In addition, the NILs used in this work will facilitate the introgression of this gene into peach elite materials, alone or pyramided with other known resistance genes such as peach powdery mildew resistance gene Vr2.

Pomianowski, K; Ocalewicz, K	Cytogenetic investigation of Arctic char x brook trout F-1, F-2 and backcross hybrids revealed remnants of the chromosomal rearrangements	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS	Chromosome fragments; Fish; Internal telomeric sites (ITS); Interspecific hybrids; Salvelinus; Triploid fish	Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) hybridize and their offspring is viable and fertile. This may be a real treat for the native European stocks of Arctic char which gene pools might be unintendedly contaminated with the genetic elements of brook trout. On the other hand, hybrids of these two species are appreciated by customers and have some potential for the aquaculture. Moreover, Salvelinus hybrids and backcross individuals are interesting models in the research focused on influence of hybridization on the genomic organization and chromosome rearrangements. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to examine chromosomes of Arctic char x brook trout F-1, F-2 hybrids and backcross individuals and compare with genomic information concerning parental species to recognize karyotypic changes provoked by the hybridization events. Application of conventional and molecular (FISH) techniques allow to identify characteristic chromosomes for both parental species in the hybrid progeny and show multiplicity of cytotypes among different types of crosses with variability in structure and number of chromosome (81-85) and chromosome arm (99-101). Chromosome fragment was detected in the karyotype of one F-1 and one backcross individual and the presence of one triploid (3n) fish was documented. Occurrence of chromosomes containing internally located telomeric sequences (ITS) inherited after brook trout or both parental species was shown in F-1 and backcross progeny. Moreover, additional CMA(3)-positive signal on chromosome from Arctic char pair no. 2 in F-1 fish and interstitially located active NOR visible on subtelo-acrocentric (F-2 hybrid) and acrocentric (Sf x H individual) chromosomes were detected. Described polymorphic chromosomes together with specific, interstitial location of CMA(3)-positive found in F-2 and Sf x H hybrids and DAPI-positive regions observed in H x Sa fish at different uniarmed chromosomes pair presumably are remnants of chromosomal rearrangements. Provided results strongly indicate that the hybridization process influenced the genome organization in the Salvelinus hybrid progeny.

A review	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE	Rice; climate change; high-temperature stress; breeding for heat tolerance	The consequences of climate change are drastically impacting field crop production; it is an immense prerequisite to attribute resilience through crop improvement. Thus, the breeders' task is to sustain yield potential in changing climate, which imperils the food grain security. Globally, high temperature is one of the grounds that support climate change. High temperature critically affects the sensitive stages of rice, starting from anthesis to grain filling, which dictates plant reproduction. In tropical conditions, it is often the yield-limiting factor and sources for yield penalty with poor grain quality. Exploring the ways to mitigate heat tolerance in rice resulted in identifying key traits like early morning flowering, pollen fertility, pollen shedding percentage, stigma receptivity, and spikelet fertility. Identifying germplasm resources with heat-tolerance traits is the foremost task followed by exploiting them in climate-resilient rice breeding. It prompts the breeding practices to improve tolerant varieties as an adaptation option suggested by various simulated crop models. With the advances in biotechnology, there are still more comprehensions required in connection to genetics, physiology, and molecular responses of heat tolerance. Herein, we reviewed the consequence of heat tolerance, germplasm resources, genetic and genomic mechanisms for attenuating heat stress impact of rice.

Currently available implementations often require custom file formats, implement only small subsets of the available statistics, and are impractical to evaluate all gene flow hypotheses across data sets with many populations or species due to computational inefficiencies. Here, we present a new software package Dsuite, an efficient implementation allowing genome scale calculations of the D and f(4)-ratio statistics across all combinations of tens or hundreds of populations or species directly from a variant call format (VCF) file. Our program also implements statistics suited for application to genomic windows, providing evidence of whether introgression is confined to specific loci, and it can also aid in interpretation of a system of f(4)-ratio results with the use of the f-branch method. Dsuite is available at , is straightforward to use, substantially more computationally efficient than comparable programs, and provides a convenient suite of tools and statistics, including some not previously available in any software package. Thus, Dsuite facilitates the assessment of evidence for gene flow, especially across larger genomic data sets.	MOL ECOL RESOUR		10.1111/1755-0998.13265	  			TRUE	TRUE	methods paper	FALSE			FALSE
Saxena, RK; Hake, A; Bohra, A; Khan, AW; Hingane, A; Sultana, R; Singh, IP; Naik, SJS; Varshney, RK	A diagnostic marker kit for Fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic diseases resistance in pigeonpea	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Fusarium wilt (FW) and sterility mosaic diseases (SMD) are key biotic constraints to pigeonpea production. Occurrence of these two diseases in congenial conditions is reported to cause complete yield loss in susceptible pigeonpea cultivars. Various studies to elucidate genomic architecture of the two traits have revealed significant marker-trait associations for use in breeding programs. However, these DNA markers could not be used effectively in genomics-assisted breeding for developing FW and SMD resistant varieties primarily due to pathogen variability, location or background specificity, lesser phenotypic variance explained by the reported QTL and cost-inefficiency of the genotyping assays. Therefore, in the present study, a novel approach has been used to develop a diagnostic kit for identification of suitable FW and SMD resistant lines. This kit was developed with 10 markers each for FW and SMD resistance. Investigation of the diversity of these loci has shown the role of different alleles in different resistant genotypes. Two genes (C.cajan_03691andC.cajan_18888) for FW resistance and four genes (C.cajan_07858, C.cajan_20995, C.cajan_21801andC.cajan_17341) for SMD resistance have been identified. More importantly, we developed a customized and cost-effective Kompetitive allele-specific PCR genotyping assay for the identified genes in order to encourage their downstream applications in pigeonpea breeding programs. The diagnostic marker kit developed here will offer great strength to pigeonpea varietal development program, since the resistance against these two diseases is essentially required for nominating an improved line in varietal release pipeline.

Wang, SL; Rohwer, S; de Zwaan, DR; Toews, DPL; Lovette, IJ; Mackenzie, J; Irwin, D	Selection on a small genomic region underpins differentiation in multiple color traits between two warbler species	EVOLUTION LETTERS	ASIP; cline; GWAS; hybrid zone; hybridization; pigmentation; RALY; Setophaga; speciation	Speciation is one of the most important processes in biology, yet the study of the genomic changes underlying this process is in its infancy. North American warbler speciesSetophaga townsendiandSetophaga occidentalishybridize in a stable hybrid zone, following a period of geographic separation. Genomic differentiation accumulated during geographic isolation can be homogenized by introgression at secondary contact, whereas genetic regions that cause low hybrid fitness can be shielded from such introgression. Here, we examined the genomic underpinning of speciation by investigating (1) the genetic basis of divergent pigmentation traits between species, (2) variation in differentiation across the genome, and (3) the evidence for selection maintaining differentiation in the pigmentation genes. Using tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in hundreds of individuals within and near the hybrid zone, genome-wide association mapping revealed a single SNP associated with cheek, crown, breast coloration, and flank streaking, reflecting pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits) or close physical linkage of different genes affecting different traits. This SNP is within an intron of the RALY gene, hence we refer to it as the RALY SNP. We then examined between-species genomic differentiation, using both genotyping-by-sequencing and whole genome sequencing. We found that the RALY SNP is within one of the highest peaks of differentiation, which contains three genes known to influence pigmentation: ASIP, EIF2S2, and RALY (the ASIP-RALY gene block). Heterozygotes at this gene block are likely of reduced fitness, as the geographic cline of the RALY SNP has been narrow over two decades. Together, these results reflect at least one barrier to gene flow within this narrow (similar to 200 kb) genomic region that modulates plumage difference between species. Despite extensive gene flow between species across the genome, this study provides evidence that selection on a phenotype-associated genomic region maintains a stable species boundary.

Patino, LH; Munoz, M; Cruz-Saavedra, L; Muskus, C; Ramirez, JD	Genomic Diversification, Structural Plasticity, and Hybridization in Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY	DNA-seq; genomic variability; copy number variations; single-nucleotide polymorphisms; Leishmania braziliensis	Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is an important Leishmania species circulating in several Central and South American countries. Among Leishmania species circulating in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, L. braziliensis has the highest genomic variability. However, genomic variability at the whole genome level has been only studied in Brazilian and Peruvian isolates; to date, no Colombian isolates have been studied. Considering that in Colombia, L. braziliensis is a species with great clinical and therapeutic relevance, as well as the role of genetic variability in the epidemiology of leishmaniasis, we analyzed and evaluated intraspecific genomic variability of L. braziliensis from Colombian and Bolivian isolates and compared them with Brazilian isolates. Twenty-one genomes were analyzed, six from Colombian patients, one from a Bolivian patient, and 14 Brazilian isolates downloaded from public databases. The results obtained of Phylogenomic analysis showed the existence of four well-supported clades, which evidenced intraspecific variability. The whole-genome analysis revealed structural variations in the somy, mainly in the Brazilian genomes (clade 1 and clade 3), low copy number variations, and a moderate number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all genomes analyzed. Interestingly, the genomes belonging to clades 2 and 3 from Colombia and Brazil, respectively, were characterized by low heterozygosity (similar to 90% of SNP loci were homozygous) and regions suggestive of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Additionally, we observed the drastic whole genome loss of heterozygosity and possible hybridization events in one genome belonging to clade 4. Unique/shared SNPs between and within the four clades were identified, revealing the importance of some of them in biological processes of L. braziliensis. Our analyses demonstrate high genomic variability of L. braziliensis in different regions of South America, mainly in Colombia and suggest that this species exhibits striking genomic diversity and a capacity of genomic hybridization; additionally, this is the first study to report whole-genome sequences of Colombian L. braziliensis isolates.

Dufresnes, C; Probonas, NM; Strachinis, I	A reassessment of the diversity of green toads (Bufotes) in the circum-Aegean region	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY	Cyclades; hybrid zone; Naxos; phylogeography; speciation	The dynamic biogeography of glacial refugia may cause complex patterns of genetic admixture between parapatric taxa, which in turn can mislead their systematics, diversity, and distributions. We investigated this issue for green toads (Bufotes) inhabiting the circum-Aegean region, a biodiversity hotspot of the Eastern Mediterranean. A previous phylogeographic study based on mitochondrial and microsatellite loci identified the hybrid zone between the European (viridis) and Anatolian (sitibundus) lineages ofB. viridisall over the Balkan Peninsula, but subsequent range-wide genomic analyses (>1000 SNPs) located this transition in Turkey, a thousand kilometers eastwards. In order to clarify the diversity and taxonomy of the circum-Aegean populations, we reconciled these conflicting findings by integrating previous data with puresitibundusindividuals. Our results confirmed that theviridis/sitibundushybrid zone extends in Western Anatolia, but that southeastern European populations feature cytonuclear discordances and a high and structured microsatellite diversity. This remarkable situation may stem from a massive geographic displacement of the hybrid zone during the last glacial fluctuations, an underappreciated yet seemingly common feature among the herpetofauna of the region. Our study thus contributes to the rising view that mitochondrial DNA can be a poor predictor of current phylogeographic structure, hence the need for genomic data, especially for narrowly distributed taxa. Finally, the analyses unambiguously support the distinction of a micro-endemic clade of green toads unique to some Cyclades islands, for which we provide a formal taxonomic description.

Gupta, P; Dholaniya, PS; Devulapalli, S; Tawari, NR; Sreelakshmi, Y; Sharma, R	Reanalysis of genome sequences of tomato accessions and its wild relatives: development of Tomato Genomic Variation (TGV) database integrating SNPs and INDELs polymorphisms	BIOINFORMATICS		Motivation: Facilitated by technological advances and expeditious decrease in the sequencing costs, whole-genome sequencing is increasingly implemented to uncover variations in cultivars/accessions of many crop plants. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars. Results: A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20 766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the '100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and insertion/deletion events and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene. This database can be used for selecting SNPs, which can be potentially deployed for improving tomato traits.

Nayfa, MG; Jones, DB; Benzie, JAH; Jerry, DR; Zenger, KR	Comparing Genomic Signatures of Selection Between the Abbassa Strain and Eight Wild Populations of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in Egypt	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS	domestication; natural population; population genetics; population structure; outlier analysis; selection; farm management; aquaculture	Domestication to captive rearing conditions, along with targeted selective breeding have genetic consequences that vary from those in wild environments. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the most translocated and farmed aquaculture species globally, farmed throughout Asia, North and South America, and its African native range. In Egypt, a breeding program established the Abbassa Strain of Nile tilapia (AS) in 2002 based on local broodstock sourced from the Nile River. The AS has been intensively selected for growth and has gone through genetic bottlenecks which have likely shifted levels and composition of genetic diversity within the strain. Consequently, there are questions on the possible genetic impact AS escapees may have on endemic populations of Nile tilapia. However, to date there have been no genetic studies comparing genetic changes in the domesticated AS to local wild populations. This study used 9,827 genome-wide SNPs to investigate population genetic structure and signatures of selection in the AS (generations 9-11) and eight wild Nile tilapia populations from Egypt. SNP analyses identified two major genetic clusters (captive and wild populations), with wild populations showing evidence of isolation-by-distance among the Nile Delta and upstream riverine populations. Between genetic clusters, approximately 6.9% of SNPs were identified as outliers with outliers identified on all 22 O. niloticus chromosomes. A lack of localized outlier clustering on the genome suggests that no genes of major effect were presently detected. The AS has retained high levels of genetic diversity (H-o_All = 0.21 +/- 0.01; H-e_All = 0.23 +/- 0.01) when compared to wild populations (H-o_All = 0.18 +/- 0.01; H-e_All = 0.17 +/- 0.01) after 11 years of domestication and selective breeding. Additionally, 565 SNPs were unique within the AS line. While these private SNPs may be due to domestication signals or founder effects, it is suspected that introgression with blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) has occurred. This study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of domestication in addition to wild population structure to inform future management and dissemination decisions. Furthermore, by conducting a baseline genetic study of wild populations prior to the dissemination of a domestic line, the effects of aquaculture on these populations can be monitored over time.

Orsman, ZHF; Ritson-Williams, R; Isthammer, KHT; Knapp, ISS; Oonen, RJT	Host-symbiont coevolution, cryptic structure, and bleaching susceptibility, in a coral species complex (Scleractinia; Poritidae)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS		The 'species' is a key concept for conservation and evolutionary biology, yet the lines between population and species-level variation are often blurred, especially for corals. The 'Porites lobata species complex' consists of branching and mounding corals that form reefs across the Pacific. We used reduced representation meta-genomic sequencing to examine genetic relationships within this species complex and to identify candidate loci associated with colony morphology, cryptic genetic structure, and apparent bleaching susceptibility. We compared existing Porites data with bleached and unbleached colonies of the branching coral P. compressa collected in Kaneohe Bay Hawai'i during the 2015 coral bleaching event. Loci that mapped to coral, symbiont, and microbial references revealed genetic structure consistent with recent host-symbiont co-evolution. Cryptic genetic clades were resolved that previous work has associated with distance from shore, but no genetic structure was associated with bleaching. We identified many candidate loci associated with morphospecies, including candidate host and symbiont loci with fixed differences between branching and mounding corals. We also found many loci associated with cryptic genetic structure, yet relatively few loci associated with bleaching. Recent host-symbiont co-evolution and rapid diversification suggests that variation and therefore the capacity of these corals to adapt may be underappreciated.

Vendelbo, NM; Sarup, P; Orabi, J; Kristensen, PS; Jahoor, A	Genetic structure of a germplasm for hybrid breeding in rye (Secale cereale L.)	PLOS ONE		Rye (Secale cereale L.) responds strongly to changes in heterozygosity with hybrids portraying strong heterosis effect on all developmental and yielding characteristics. In order to achieve the highest potential heterosis effect parental lines must originate from genetically distinct gene pools. Here we report the first comprehensive SNP-based population study of an elite germplasm using fertilization control system for hybrid breeding in rye that is genetically different to the predominating P-type. In total 376 inbred lines from Nordic Seed Germany GmbH were genotyped for 4419 polymorphic SNPs. The aim of this study was to confirm and quantify the genetic separation of parental populations, unveil their genetic characteristics and investigate underlying population structures. Through a palette of complimenting analysis, we confirmed a strong genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.332) of parental populations validating the germplasms suitability for hybrid breeding. These were, furthermore, found to diverge considerably in several features with the maternal population portraying a strong population structure characterized by a narrow genetic profile, small effective population size and high genome-wise linkage disequilibrium. We propose that the employed male-sterility system putatively constitutes a population determining parameter by influencing the rate of introducing novel genetic variation to the parental populations. Functional analysis of linkage blocks led to identification of a conserved segment on the distal 4RL chromosomal region annotated to the Rfp3 male-fertility restoration 'Pampa' type gene. Findings of our study emphasized the immediate value of comprehensive population studies on elite breeding germplasms as a pre-requisite for application of genomic-based breeding techniques, introgression of novel material and to support breeder decision-making.

Gueuning, M; Frey, JE; Praz, C	Ultraconserved yet informative for species delimitation: Ultraconserved elements resolve long-standing systematic enigma in Central European bees	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	conservation biology; DNA barcoding; mitochondrial introgression; species delimitation; ultraconserved elements; wild bees	Accurate and testable species hypotheses are essential for measuring, surveying and managing biodiversity. Taxonomists often rely on mitochondrial DNA barcoding to complement morphological species delimitations. Although COI-barcoding has largely proven successful in assisting identifications for most animal taxa, there are nevertheless numerous cases where mitochondrial barcodes do not reflect species hypotheses. For instance, what is regarded as a single species can be associated with two distinct DNA barcodes, which can point either to cryptic diversity or to within-species mitochondrial divergences without reproductive isolation. In contrast, two or more species can share barcodes, for instance due to mitochondrial introgression. These intrinsic limitations of DNA barcoding are commonly addressed with nuclear genomic markers, which are expensive, may have low repeatability and often require high-quality DNA. To overcome these limitations, we examined the use of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) as a quick and robust genomic approach to address such problematic cases of species delimitation in bees. This genomic method was assessed using six different species complexes suspected to harbour cryptic diversity, mitochondrial introgression or mitochondrial paraphyly. The sequencing of UCEs recovered between 686 and 1,860 homologous nuclear loci and provided explicit species delimitation in all investigated species complexes. These results provide strong evidence for the suitability of UCEs as a fast method for species delimitation even in recently diverged lineages. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence for both mitochondrial introgression among distinct bee species, and mitochondrial paraphyly within a single bee species.

Yang, WF; Zheng, LZ; He, Y; Zhu, LY; Chen, XQ; Tao, YS	Fine mapping and candidate gene prediction of a major quantitative trait locus for tassel branch number in maize	GENE	Zea mays; QTL fine mapping; Tassel inflorescence architecture; Pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein; Histone deacetylase	Tassel branch number (TBN) is the principal component of tassel inflorescence architecture in the maize plant. TBN is believed to be controlled by a set of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, it is necessary to identify and genetically evaluate these QTLs before the TBN can be improved upon using a molecular breeding approach. Therefore, in this study, we developed the chromosome segment introgression line (CSIL) TBN1 with the Zong31 (Z31) background and a higher TBN, and then we utilized the CSIL-TBN1-derived populations and identified a major QTL, qTBN6a, by linkage analysis. Fine mapping of the qTBN6a QTL was validated using a set of sub-CSILs and located in a 240-kb genomic region (Bin6.07) in B73RefGen_v4. One allele included in the introgression fragment had a positive effect, noticeably increasing the TBN and demonstrating the potential to improve the TBN of Z31. Afterward, in the qTBN6a interval, gene expression, sequence alignment, functional analysis, and the analysis of motifs in the 5' UTR suggested that candidate genes of qTBN6a are important functional genes at the early stage of immature infected tassel development. Among these candidate genes, a long W22::Mu-insertion/deletion in exon one and an 11-bp insertion/deletion in the promoter region may affect the variation of the qTBN6a QTL observed between Z31 and TBN1. In addition, the candidate genes of qTBN6a were found to encode a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)-containing protein and a histone deacetylase (HDA), which are known to be closely associated with RNA editing and stability and chromatin state activity for the transcription of gene expression, respectively. Finally, a model of qTBN6a based on the synergistic regulation of PPR and HDA for the maintenance of inflorescence meristem (IM) identity and its differentiation to the branch meristem (BM) in TBN1 was suggested. Collectively, our results provide an available locus for the molecular improvement of TBN and the isolation of functional genes underlying this QTL.

Singh, G; Kuzniar, A; Brouwer, M; Martinez-Ortiz, C; Bachem, CWB; Tikunov, YM; Bovy, AG; Visser, RGF; Finkers, R	Linked Data Platform for Solanaceae Species	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL	prioritization of candidate genes; plant breeding; Solanaceae; QTLs; semantic web; linked data	Genetics research is increasingly focusing on mining fully sequenced genomes and their annotations to identify the causal genes associated with traits (phenotypes) of interest. However, a complex trait is typically associated with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs), each comprising many genes, that can positively or negatively affect the trait of interest. To help breeders in ranking candidate genes, we developed an analytical platform called pbg-ld that provides semantically integrated geno- and phenotypic data on Solanaceae species. This platform combines both unstructured data from scientific literature and structured data from publicly available biological databases using the Linked Data approach. In particular, QTLs were extracted from tables of full-text articles from the Europe PubMed Central (PMC) repository using QTLTableMiner(++) (QTM), while the genomic annotations were obtained from the Sol Genomics Network (SGN), UniProt and Ensembl Plants databases. These datasets were transformed into Linked Data graphs, which include cross-references to many other relevant databases such as Gramene, Plant Reactome, InterPro and KEGG Orthology (KO). Users can query and analyze the integrated data through a web interface or programmatically via the SPARQL and RESTful services (APIs). We illustrate the usability of pbg-ld by querying genome annotations, by comparing genome graphs, and by two biological use cases in Jupyter Notebooks. In the first use case, we performed a comparative genomics study using pbg-ld to compare the difference in the genetic mechanism underlying tomato fruit shape and potato tuber shape. In the second use case, we developed a seamlessly integrated workflow that uses genomic data from pbg-ld knowledge graphs and prioritization pipelines to predict candidate genes within QTL regions for metabolic traits of tomato.

Nyine, M; Adhikari, E; Clinesmith, M; Jordan, KW; Fritz, AK; Akhunov, E	Genomic Patterns of Introgression in Interspecific Populations Created by Crossing Wheat with Its Wild Relative	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Aegilops tauschii; wild relative; introgression; hexaploid wheat; recombination; tenacious glume	Introgression from wild relatives is a valuable source of novel allelic diversity for breeding. We investigated the genomic patterns of introgression fromAegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars. The population of 351 BC1F3:(5)lines was selected based on phenology from crosses between six hexaploid wheat lines and 21 wheat-Ae. tauschiioctoploids. SNP markers developed for this population and a diverse panel of 116Ae. tauschiiaccessions by complexity-reduced genome sequencing were used to detect introgression based on the identity-by-descent analysis. Overall, introgression frequency positively correlated with recombination rate, with a high incidence of introgression at the ends of chromosomes and low in the pericentromeric regions, and was negatively related to sequence divergence between the parental genomes. Reduced introgression in the pericentromeric low-recombining regions spans nearly 2/3 of each chromosome arm, suggestive of the polygenic nature of introgression barriers that could be associated with multilocus negative epistasis between the alleles of wild and cultivated wheat. On the contrary, negative selection against the wild allele ofTg, controlling free-threshing trait and located in the high-recombining chromosomal region, led to reduced introgression only within similar to 10 Mbp region aroundTg. These results are consistent with the effect of selection on linked variation described by the Hill-Robertson effect, and offer insights into the introgression population development for crop improvement to maximize retention of introgressed diversity across entire genome.

Shchur, V; Svedberg, J; Medina, P; Corbett-Detig, R; Nielsen, R	On the Distribution of Tract Lengths During Adaptive Introgression	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	adaptive introgression; tract length; adaptation; EPAS1; admixture; selection	Admixture is increasingly being recognized as an important factor in evolutionary genetics. The distribution of genomic admixture tracts, and the resulting effects on admixture linkage disequilibrium, can be used to date the timing of admixture between species or populations. However, the theory used for such prediction assumes selective neutrality despite the fact that many famous examples of admixture involve natural selection acting for or against admixture. In this paper, we investigate the effects of positive selection on the distribution of tract lengths. We develop a theoretical framework that relies on approximating the trajectory of the selected allele using a logistic function. By numerically calculating the expected allele trajectory, we also show that the approach can be extended to cases where the logistic approximation is poor due to the effects of genetic drift. Using simulations, we show that the model is highly accurate under most scenarios. We use the model to show that positive selection on average will tend to increase the admixture tract length. However, perhaps counter-intuitively, conditional on the allele frequency at the time of sampling, positive selection will actually produce shorter expected tract lengths. We discuss the consequences of our results in interpreting the timing of the introgression ofEPAS1from Denisovans into the ancestors of Tibetans.

Use of genomic tools including, genetic engineering, functional genomics, genome wide association and bioinformatics facilitate exploitation of traits to shorten breeding cycles. Short breeding cycles can be achieved by selection and screening of the best cultivars in the genebank. However, it is time consuming to develop new cultivars. The incorporation of traits to the new grape cultivar is done through conventional breeding by crossing male and female parents with contrasting traits. In addition, application of molecular markers can easily identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) influencing traits of interest for fastening introgression into the recipient grape cultivars by backcrossing method. Genetic engineering is another tool that uses Agrobacterium tumefaciens and biolistic mediated transformation whereby targeted genes are inserted into a DNA of a new grape cultivar for regeneration for example, grape transgenes. In a hybridization study, in which a seedless cultivar is used as maternal genotype, embryo rescue technique is necessary. Some traits in consideration in grape breeding include, flowering time, yield, drought tolerant, diseases resistance, sugar content and wine quality. Therefore, the application of genomic and genetic engineering tools is inevitable for grape improvement.

Quilodran, CS; Tsoupas, A; Currat, M	The Spatial Signature of Introgression After a Biological Invasion With Hybridization	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	hybridization; introgression; invasive species; range expansion; spatially explicit simulations	The accumulation of genome-wide molecular data has emphasized the important role of hybridization in the evolution of many organisms, which may carry introgressed genomic segments resulting from past admixture events with other taxa. Despite a number of examples of hybridization occurring during biological invasions, the resulting spatial patterns of genomic introgression remain poorly understood. Preliminary simulation studies have suggested a heterogeneous spatial level of introgression for invasive taxa after range expansion. We investigated in detail the robustness of this pattern and its persistence over time for both invasive and local organisms. Using spatially explicit simulations, we explored the spatial distribution of introgression across the area of colonization of an invasive taxon hybridizing with a local taxon. The general pattern for neutral loci supported by our results is an increasing introgression of local genes into the invasive taxon with the increase in the distance from the source of the invasion and a decreasing introgression of invasive genes into the local taxon. However, we also show there is some variation in this general trend depending on the scenario investigated. Spatial heterogeneity of introgression within a given taxon is thus an expected neutral pattern in structured populations after a biological invasion with a low to moderate amount of hybridization. We further show that this pattern is consistent with published empirical observations. Using additional simulations, we argue that the spatial pattern of Neanderthal introgression in modern humans, which has been documented to be higher in Asia than in Europe, can be explained by a model of hybridization with Neanderthals in Eurasia during the range expansion of modern humans from Africa. Our results support the view that weak hybridization during range expansion may explain spatially heterogeneous introgression patterns without the need to invoke selection.

Here, we exploited an introgression population representing wild desert-adapted species and a domesticated cultivar to establish the genetic basis of gene expression and chemical variation accompanying the transfer of wild-species-associated fruit traits. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis of 580 lines coupled to pathogen sensitivity assays resulted in the identification of genomic loci associated with levels of hundreds of transcripts and metabolites. These associations occurred in hotspots representing coordinated perturbation of metabolic pathways and ripening-related processes. Here, we identify components of theSolanumalkaloid pathway, as well as genes and metabolites involved in pathogen defense and linking fungal resistance with changes in the fruit ripening regulatory network. Our results outline a framework for understanding metabolism and pathogen resistance during tomato fruit ripening and provide insights into key fruit quality traits. A study of 580 tomato lines resulting from a cross between a wild desert-adapted species and a domesticated cultivar elucidates the genetic basis of gene expression and metabolite variation associated with fruit traits and defense against pathogens.

Spike-Stalk injection method (SSI) has long been applied in rice genetic improvement by directly introducing genetic materials from non-mating donor species, while its inheritance patterns and the underlying mechanisms are poorly elucidated. In this study, a rice variantERV1with improved yield-related traits was screened out in the way of introducing genomic DNA ofOryza eichingeri(2n=24, CC genome) intoRH78(Oryza sativa L. 2n=24, AA genome) using SSI method. Genome-wide comparison revealed that the genomic heterozygosity ofERV1was approximately 8-fold higher thanRH78. Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing technology (RAD-seq) and association analysis of theERV1inbred F2 population identified 5 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regions responsible for these yield-related traits, and found that genomic heterozygosity ofERV1inbred lines was significantly lower thanERV1, while spontaneous mutation rate of theERV1inbred lines was significantly higher thanERV1. Our results preliminarily uncovered the inheritance patterns of SSI variant rice, and the potential genomic regions for traits changes, which yielded novel insights into the mechanisms of SSI method, and may accelerate our understanding of plant genome evolution, domestication, and speciation in nature.

We compiled data on social pairing from nine studies for 2,679 residentVermivorato assess evolutionary divergence. Hybridization between pure phenotypes occurred with 1.2% of resident males for sympatric populations. Pairing success rates for Golden-winged Warblers was 83% and for Blue-winged Warblers was 77%. Pairing success for the hybrid Brewster's Warbler was significantly lower from both species at 54%, showing sexual selection against hybrids. Backcross frequencies for Golden-winged Warblers at 4.9% were significantly higher than for Blue-winged Warblers at 1.7%. More frequent backcrossing by Golden-winged Warblers, which produces hybrid phenotypes, may contribute to the replacement of Golden-winged by Blue-winged Warblers. Reproductive isolation due to behavioral isolation plus sexual selection against hybrids was 0.960. Our analyses suggest that plumage differences are the main driving force for this strong isolation with reduced hybrid fitness contributing to a lesser degree. The major impact of plumage differences to reproductive isolation is compatible with genomic analyses (Current Biology, 2016, 26, 2313), which showed the largest genetic difference between these phenotypes occurred with plumage genes. These phenotypes have maintained morphological, behavioral, and ecological differences during two centuries of hybridization. Our estimate of reproductive isolation supports recognition of these phenotypes as two species. The decline and extirpation of the Golden-winged Warbler in almost all areas of recent sympatry suggest that continued coexistence of both species will require eco-geographic isolation.

Genetic diversity in cultivated and wild germplasm is characterized for use with various breeding objectives. Molecular markers have been developed to facilitate sunflower breeding. This review was undertaken to discuss molecular markers, which have been validated in different genetic backgrounds for traits of economic interest in sunflower. Markers found to be linked to monogenic traits in mapping populations may be used to select plants with those traits; review of the literature identified markers available for several monogenic traits including resistance against pests and pathogens. Markers linked to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for many disease resistance and economically important traits that have also been identified in specific populations and target environments are also reported here. These identified linked markers should be validated in different genetic backgrounds and environments to ensure widespread utility. Publicly available inbred lines carrying traits of interest and validated markers related to them are summarized in this review, which also highlights traits for which these resources are still lacking, possibly due to lack of funding despite the importance of this hybrid crop. Genomic sequence data is now available for sunflower, which must now be exploited to develop new SNP based markers linked to genes of interest to mine allelic diversity related to economically important traits, especially traits well studied in other organisms, such as seed oil content and resistance genes.

Such data are useful to address phylogenetic congruence among individual genes. Concatenated analyses of unlinked genes often produce well-resolved phylogenetic trees with bootstrap support on major nodes at or approaching 100%, but they have been criticized for providing incorrect phylogenies for various reasons to include a history of hybridization, introgression, and incomplete lineage sorting. The present study compares next-generation sequencing results of the same accessions ofDaucuswith different genomic regions, of which three have been reported before: (i) the entire plastid genome, (ii) 47 mitochondrial genes, and (iii) 94 conserved nuclear orthologs. Here, we report a fourth dataset, (iv) 564 895 nuclear SNPs. There are areas of discordance in all four results using the same accessions analyzed with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and with the nuclear data species trees through a coalescent analysis. The nuclear results show significant areas of discordance that were unexpected, because these studies used the same DNA samples, the nuclear studies were generated from large and high-quality datasets with the SNPs distributed on all nine linkage groups ofDaucus carota, and the results were supported by high bootstrap values. These results raise questions concerning the best data and analytical methods to reconstruct and understand the truth of a phylogeny.

Early seed germination (ESG) and early seedling vigor (ESV) are the crucial traits for WCA. This study attempted to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and hotspot regions governing ESG and ESV traits. A total of 167 BC(1)F(5)selective introgression lines developed from an early backcross population involving Weed Tolerant Rice 1 (WTR-1) as the recipient parent and Y-134 as the donor parent were phenotyped for ESG and ESV traits. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in ESG-related traits except for root length and in ESV-related traits except for plant height at 7 days after sowing. A total of 677-high quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to analyze the marker-trait association from a 6 K SNP genotyping array. Forty-three QTLs were identified on all chromosomes, except on chromosomes 4 and 8. Thirty QTLs were contributed by a desirable allele from Y-134, whereas 13 QTLs were from WTR-1. Twenty-eight of the identified genetic loci associated with ESG and ESV traits were novel. Two QTL hotspot regions were mapped on chromosomes 11 and 12. The genomic regions of QTL hotspots were fine-tuned and a total of 13 putative candidate genes were discovered on chromosomes 11 and 12 collectively. The mapped QTLs will be useful in advancing the marker aided-selection schemes and breeding programs for the development of rice cultivars with WCA traits.

Over the past few decades new breeding and genomic approaches have been used to enhance the genotypic performance under abiotic stress conditions. In sugarcane, introgression of genes from wild species and allied genera for abiotic stress tolerance traits plays a significant role in the development of several stress-tolerant varieties. Moreover, the genomics and transcriptomics approaches have helped to elucidate the key genes/TFs and pathways involved in abiotic stress tolerance in sugarcane. Several novel miRNAs families /proteins or regulatory elements that are responsible for drought, salinity, and cold tolerance have been identified through high-throughput sequencing. The existing sugarcane monoploid genome sequence information opens new gateways and opportunities for researchers to improve the desired traits through efficient genome editing tools, such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas (CRISPR/Cas) system. TALEN mediated mutations in a highly conserved region of the caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) of sugarcane significantly reduces the lignin content in the cell wall which is amenable for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. In this review, we focus on current breeding with genomic approaches and their substantial role in enhancing cane production under the abiotic stress conditions, which is expected to provide new insights to plant breeders and biotechnologists to modify their strategy in developing stress-tolerant sugarcane varieties, which can highlight the future demand of cane, bio-energy, and viability of sugar industries.	3 BIOTECH		10.1007/s13205-020-02416-w	  			TRUE	TRUE	review paper	FALSE			FALSE

The impact of terminal heat stress is generally reported in the case of late sown wheat. In this study, our aim was to identify genomic regions for various agronomic traits under late sown conditions by using genome-wide association approach. An association mapping panel of 205 wheat accessions was evaluated under late sown conditions at three different locations in India. Genotyping of the association panel revealed 15,886 SNPs, out of which 11,911 SNPs with exact physical locations on the wheat reference genome were used in association analysis. A total of 69 QTLs (10 significantly associated and 59 suggestive) were identified for ten different traits including productive tiller number (17), grain yield (14), plant height (12), grain filling rate (6), grain filling duration (5), days to physiological maturity (4), grain number (3), thousand grain weight (3), harvest index (3), and biomass (2). Out of these associated QTLs, 17 were novel for traits, namely PTL (3), GY (2), GFR (6), HI (3) and GNM (3). Moreover, five consistent QTLs across environments were identified for GY (4) and TGW (1). Also, 11 multi-trait SNPs and three hot spot regions on Chr1Ds, Chr2BS, Chr2DS harboring many QTLs for many traits were identified. In addition, identification of heat tolerant germplasm lines based on favorable alleles HD2888, IC611071, IC611273, IC75240, IC321906, IC416188, and J31-170 would facilitate their targeted introgression into popular wheat cultivars. The significantly associated QTLs identified in the present study can be further validated to identify robust markers for utilization in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for development of heat tolerant wheat cultivars.

Bernos, TA; Jeffries, KM; Mandrak, NE	Linking genomics and fish conservation decision making: a review	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES	Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Invasive species; Management units; Monitoring; Conservation decision framework	Despite the promising applications of genome-wide information to conservation, the field of conservation genomics remains hindered by a research-practice gap. Identifying the benefits from genomics in relation to fish conservation planning and decision-making could contribute to bridging this gap. The goals of our study were twofold. First, we reviewed the fish conservation genomic literature to determine how genomic information has been used to inform conservation decision making; and second, we examined how genomic information can be linked to an existing conservation decision framework. Our review showed that, as fish conservation genomics studies accumulate over time, collaborations between researchers and conservation practitioners are becoming increasingly frequent. While the field is dominated by studies of economically important families (e.g. salmonids, acipenserids) in first-world countries (North America, Europe), it has a broad taxonomic coverage where species of both local and global conservation concern are well represented. We also show that genomic information can readily be harnessed to guide decisions within existing conservation decision frameworks, from the conceptualization (identification of conservation targets and threats) to the implementation and the monitoring of conservation actions. In addition, our review identifies some limitations related to genomic inferences for conservation and proposes solutions to address these uncertainties and improve communication between conservation genomic scientists and practitioners. For genomic researchers, we outline how conservation decisions are made; for practitioners, we illustrate how genomic information can inform decision-making.

Earlier breeding efforts in India led to the adoption of tomato cultivars carrying the resistance geneTy-2. However, it has been observed recently that such cultivars/hybrids are susceptible to begomoviruses. This requires the identification of additional or new sources of resistance against ToLCBaV. The present study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of severalTygenes in providing resistance against infection by ToLCBaV. The kinetics of virus multiplication in differentTyresistance gene stocks of tomato were estimated and compared using quantitative PCR data. Accumulation of viral genomic units and symptom severity were lower in tomato lines carryingTy-3andTy-2 + Ty-3compared with those carryingTy-2alone. All tested lines carryingTy-2showed typical tomato leaf curl disease symptoms. Tomato lines carryingTy-2 + ty-5andty-5 + Ty-6combinations had a significantly higher disease severity index and viral genomic units compared to those carryingTy-3andTy-2 + Ty-3at 30 days postinoculation. The accumulation level of ToLCBaV genomic units serves as a good indicator for resistance selection along with other parameters of disease.

Phifer-Rixey, M; Harr, B; Hey, J	Further resolution of the house mouse (Mus musculus) phylogeny by integration over isolation-with-migration histories	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Speciation; Divergence; Population size; IMa3	Background The three main subspecies of house mice,Mus musculus castaneus, Mus musculus domesticus, andMus musculus musculus,are estimated to have diverged similar to 350-500KYA. Resolution of the details of their evolutionary history is complicated by their relatively recent divergence, ongoing gene flow among the subspecies, and complex demographic histories. Previous studies have been limited to some extent by the number of loci surveyed and/or by the scope of the method used. Here, we apply a method (IMa3) that provides an estimate of a population phylogeny while allowing for complex histories of gene exchange. Results Results strongly support a topology withM. m. domesticusas sister toM. m. castaneusandM. m. musculus. In addition, we find evidence of gene flow between all pairs of subspecies, but that gene flow is most restricted fromM. m. musculusintoM. m. domesticus. Estimates of other key parameters are dependent on assumptions regarding generation time and mutation rate in house mice. Nevertheless, our results support previous findings that the effective population size,N(e,)ofM. m. castaneusis larger than that of the other two subspecies, that the three subspecies began diverging similar to 130 - 420KYA, and that the time between divergence events was short. Conclusions Joint demographic and phylogenetic analyses of genomic data provide a clearer picture of the history of divergence in house mice.

Zhang, MY; Zhang, W; Zhu, XW; Sun, Q; Yan, CH; Xu, SS; Fiedler, J; Cai, XW	Dissection and physical mapping of wheat chromosome 7B by inducing meiotic recombination with its homoeologues inAegilops speltoidesandThinopyrum elongatum	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Key message We constructed a homoeologous recombination-based bin map of wheat chromosome 7B, providing a unique physical framework for further study of chromosome 7B and its homoeologues in wheat and its relatives. Homoeologous recombination leads to the dissection and diversification of the wheat genome. Advances in genome sequencing and genotyping have dramatically improved the efficacy and throughput of homoeologous recombination-based genome studies and alien introgression in wheat and its relatives. In this study, we aimed to physically dissect and map wheat chromosome 7B by inducing meiotic recombination of chromosome 7B with its homoeologues 7E inThinopyrum elongatumand 7S inAegilops speltoides. The special genotypes, which were double monosomic for chromosomes 7B' + 7E' or 7B' + 7S' and homozygous for theph1bmutant, were produced to enhance 7B - 7E and 7B - 7S recombination. Chromosome-specific DNA markers were developed and used to pre-screen the large recombination populations for 7B - 7E and 7B - 7S recombinants. The DNA marker-mediated preselections were verified by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). In total, 29 7B - 7E and 61 7B - 7S recombinants and multiple chromosome aberrations were recovered and delineated by GISH and the wheat 90 K SNP assay. Integrated GISH and SNP analysis of the recombinants physically mapped the recombination breakpoints and partitioned wheat chromosome 7B into 44 bins with 523 SNPs assigned within. A composite bin map was constructed for chromosome 7B, showing the bin size and physical distribution of SNPs. This provides a unique physical framework for further study of chromosome 7B and its homoeologues. In addition, the 7B - 7E and 7B - 7S recombinants extend the genetic variability of wheat chromosome 7B and represent useful germplasm for wheat breeding. Thereby, this genomics-enabled chromosome engineering approach facilitates wheat genome study and enriches the gene pool of wheat improvement.

Fadakar, D; Malekian, M; Hemami, MR; Lerp, H; Rezaei, HR; Barmann, EV	Repeated hybridization of two closely related gazelle species (Gazella bennettiiandGazella subgutturosa) in central Iran	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	chinkara; conservation genetics; cytochromeb; desert ungulate; goitered gazelle; hybridization; mitochondrial capture; nuclear intron	Interspecific hybridization increasingly occurs in the course of anthropogenic actions, such as species translocations and introductions, and habitat modifications or occurs in sympatric species due to the shortage of conspecific mates. Compared with anthropogenically caused hybridization, natural hybridization is more difficult to prove, but both play an important role in conservation. In this study, we detected hybridization of two gazelle sister species,Gazella bennettii(adapted to dry areas) andGazella subgutturosa(adapted to open plains), in five habitat areas, whereG. bennettiinaturally occur in central Iran. The hybrids have a nuclear genomic identity (based on two introns), habitat preference, and phenotype ofG. bennettii, but the mitochondrial identity (based on cytb) ofG. subgutturosa. We suggest that natural hybridization of femaleG. subgutturosaand maleG. bennettiihappened twice in central Iran in prehistoric times, based on the haplotype pattern that we found. However, we found indications of recent hybridization between both species under special circumstances, for example, in breeding centers, due to translocations, or in areas of sympatry due to the shortage of conspecific mates. Therefore, these two species must be kept separately in the breeding centers, and introduction of one of them into the habitat of the other must be strictly avoided.

Zarid, M; Garcia-Carpintero, V; Esteras, C; Esteva, J; Bueso, MC; Canizares, J; Pico, MB; Monforte, AJ; Fernandez-Trujillo, JP	Transcriptomic analysis of a near-isogenic line of melon with high fruit flesh firmness during ripening	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE	Cucumis meloL; fruit quality traits; fruit senescence; postharvest quality; RNA-Seq; texture	BACKGROUND A near-isogenic line (NIL) of melon (SC10-2) with introgression in linkage group X was studied from harvest (at firm-ripe stage of maturity) until day 18 of postharvest storage at 20.5 degrees C together with its parental control ('Piel de Sapo', PS). RESULTS SC10-2 showed higher flesh firmness and whole fruit hardness but lower juiciness than its parental. SC10-2 showed a decrease in respiration rate accompanied by a decrease in ethylene production during ripening, both of which fell to a greater extent than in PS. The introgression affected 11 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the levels of which during ripening were generally higher in SC10-2 than in PS. Transcriptomic analysis from RNA-Seq revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the effects studied. For example, 909 DEGs were exclusive to the introgression, and only 23 DEGs were exclusive to postharvest ripening time. Major functions of the DEGs associated with introgression or ripening time were identified by cluster analysis. About 37 genes directly and/or indirectly affected the delay in ripening of SC10-2 compared with PS in general and, more particularly, the physiological and quality traits measured and, probably, the differential non-climacteric response. Of the former genes, we studied in more detail at least five that mapped in the introgression in linkage group (LG) X, and 32 outside it. CONCLUSION There is an apparent control of textural changes, VOCs and fruit ripening by an expression quantitative trait locus located in LG X together with a direct control on them due to genes presented in the introgression (CmTrpD,CmNADH1,CmTCP15,CmGDSL esterase/lipase, andCmHK4-like) andCmNAC18.

AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY	Wheat; Rust resistance; Pyramiding; Lr19; Sr25; Yr15	The study was aimed to develop rust resistant genotypes with genome of prominent wheat variety HS240 by pyramiding of linked leaf rust and stem rust resistance genesLr19andSr25with stripe rust resistance geneYr15. The genotypes FLW13 and FLW20 were used as gene donors for transfer ofYr15andLr19/Sr25, respectively. The molecular markersscs265,wmc221,PSY1-E1, andGblinked toLr19/Sr25andbarc8andgwm11linked toYr15were used for foreground selection. Background selection, involving 58 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers polymorphic between HS240 and FLW20; 72 between HS240 and FLW13 was carried out to recover the genome of HS240 in advanced bulks derived from a cross HS240*2/FLW20//HS240*2/FLW13. The SSR based genome recovery in selected advanced breeding lines, WBM3682 and WBM3684 was 90.8% and 93.3%, respectively. The 35 K SNP array based analysis of genomic regions of HS240 also substantiated the results of genomic recovery estimated through SSR markers. The selected line WBM3682 recorded average grain yield of 25.7q/ha and showed its superiority over parental check HS240 under rainfed situations. This study has led to development of rust resistant wheat carrying genome of HS240.	AUSTRALAS PLANT PATH		10.1007/s13313-020-00738-0	Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE
Henderson, EC; Brelsford, A	Genomic differentiation across the speciation continuum in three hummingbird species pairs	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Speciation genomics; Speciation continuum; Divergence; Polymorphism; Hummingbird; F-ST; d(xy)	Background The study of speciation has expanded with the increasing availability and affordability of high-resolution genomic data. How the genome evolves throughout the process of divergence and which regions of the genome are responsible for causing and maintaining that divergence have been central questions in recent work. Here, we use three pairs of species from the recently diverged bee hummingbird clade to investigate differences in the genome at different stages of speciation, using divergence times as a proxy for the speciation continuum. Results Population measures of relative differentiation between hybridizing species reveal that different chromosome types diverge at different stages of speciation. Using F(ST)as our relative measure of differentiation we found that the sex chromosome shows signs of divergence early in speciation. Next, small autosomes (microchromosomes) accumulate highly diverged genomic regions, while the large autosomes (macrochromosomes) accumulate genomic regions of divergence at a later stage of speciation. Conclusions Our finding that genomic windows of elevated F(ST)accumulate on small autosomes earlier in speciation than on larger autosomes is counter to the prediction that F(ST)increases with size of chromosome (i.e. with decreased recombination rate), and is not represented when weighted average F(ST)per chromosome is compared with chromosome size. The results of this study suggest that multiple chromosome characteristics such as recombination rate and gene density combine to influence the genomic locations of signatures of divergence.

McLaughlin, JF; Faircloth, BC; Glenn, TC; Winker, K	Divergence, gene flow, and speciation in eight lineages of trans-Beringian birds	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Beringia; Pleistocene glacial cycles; population genomics; speciation with gene flow; UCEs; ultraconserved elements	Determining how genetic diversity is structured between populations that span the divergence continuum from populations to biological species is key to understanding the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. We investigated genetic divergence and gene flow in eight lineages of birds with a trans-Beringian distribution, where Asian and North American populations have likely been split and reunited through multiple Pleistocene glacial cycles. Our study transects the speciation process, including eight pairwise comparisons in three orders (ducks, shorebirds and passerines) at population, subspecies and species levels. Using ultraconserved elements (UCEs), we found that these lineages represent conditions from slightly differentiated populations to full biological species. Although allopatric speciation is considered the predominant mode of divergence in birds, all of our best divergence models included gene flow, supporting speciation with gene flow as the predominant mode in Beringia. In our eight lineages, three were best described by a split-migration model (divergence with gene flow), three best fit a secondary contact scenario (isolation followed by gene flow), and two showed support for both models. The lineages were not evenly distributed across a divergence space defined by gene flow (M) and differentiation (F-ST), instead forming two discontinuous groups: one with relatively shallow divergence, no fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and high rates of gene flow between populations; and the second with relatively deeply divergent lineages, multiple fixed SNPs, and low gene flow. Our results highlight the important role that gene flow plays in avian divergence in Beringia.	MOL ECOL		10.1111/mec.15574	  			TRUE	TRUE	did not investigate introgression	FALSE			FALSE
Jiao, XY; Flouri, T; Rannala, B; Yang, ZH	The Impact of Cross-Species Gene Flow on Species Tree Estimation	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	IM; introgression; migration; MSci; multispecies coalescent; species tree	Recent analyses of genomic sequence data suggest cross-species gene flow is common in both plants and animals, posing challenges to species tree estimation. We examine the levels of gene flow needed to mislead species tree estimation with three species and either episodic introgressive hybridization or continuous migration between an outgroup and one ingroup species. Several species tree estimation methods are examined, including the majority-vote method based on the most common gene tree topology (with either the true or reconstructed gene trees used), the UPGMA method based on the average sequence distances (or average coalescent times) between species, and the full-likelihood method based on multilocus sequence data. Our results suggest that the majority-vote method based on gene tree topologies is more robust to gene flow than the UPGMA method based on coalescent times and both are more robust than likelihood assuming a multispecies coalescent (MSC) model with no cross-species gene flow. Comparison of the continuous migration model with the episodic introgression model suggests that a small amount of gene flow per generation can cause drastic changes to the genetic history of the species and mislead species tree methods, especially if the species diverged through radiative speciation events. Estimates of parameters under the MSC with gene flow suggest that African mosquito species in the Anopheles gambiae species complex constitute such an example of extreme impact of gene flow on species phylogeny.

Kiranmayee, KNSU; Hash, CT; Sivasubramani, S; Ramu, P; Amindala, BP; Rathore, A; Kishor, PBK; Gupta, R; Deshpande, SP	Fine-Mapping of Sorghum Stay-Green QTL on Chromosome10 Revealed Genes Associated with Delayed Senescence	GENES	sorghum chromosome 10 long arm (SBI-10L); fine-mapping; stay-green; candidate genes; percent green leaf area; delayed senescence	This study was conducted to dissect the genetic basis and to explore the candidate genes underlying one of the important genomic regions on an SBI-10 long arm (L), governing the complex stay-green trait contributing to post-flowering drought-tolerance in sorghum. A fine-mapping population was developed from an introgression line cross-RSG04008-6 (stay-green) x J2614-11 (moderately senescent). The fine-mapping population with 1894 F-2 was genotyped with eight SSRs and a set of 152 recombinants was identified, advanced to the F-4 generation, field evaluated with three replications over 2 seasons, and genotyped with the GBS approach. A high-resolution linkage map was developed for SBI-10L using 260 genotyping by sequencing-Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (GBS-SNPs). Using the best linear unpredicted means (BLUPs) of the percent green leaf area (%GL) traits and the GBS-based SNPs, we identified seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) clusters and single gene, mostly involved in drought-tolerance, for each QTL cluster, viz., AP2/ERF transcription factor family (Sobic.010G202700), NBS-LRR protein (Sobic.010G205600), ankyrin-repeat protein (Sobic.010G205800), senescence-associated protein (Sobic.010G270300), WD40 (Sobic.010G205900), CPK1 adapter protein (Sobic.010G264400), LEA2 protein (Sobic.010G259200) and an expressed protein (Sobic.010G201100). The target genomic region was thus delimited from 15 Mb to 8 genes co-localized with QTL clusters, and validated using quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR.

Cao, AQ; Wang, RH; Wang, JB	Gene Expression and miRNA Regulation Changes in Leaves of Rice Backcross Introgression Lines	AGRONOMY-BASEL	gene; miRNA; expression; backcross introgression line; rice; Oryza longistaminata	High-throughput sequencing was used to distinguish the gene and miRNA expression profiles in the leaves of three progenies from a rice backcross introgression line (BC2F12) and their parents (Oryza sativaand wild rice,O. longistaminata). A total of 33,419 genes and 513 miRNAs were identified in two parents and three lines, and the majority of the genes and miRNAs were commonly expressed. The results show that 10.23% to 17.94% of the genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the progenies compared with those of the two parents, and the majority of them were up-regulated. Of the miRNAs, 12.56% to15.43% were differentially expressed in the progeny/O. sativacomparisons and the majority of which were up-regulated, while 42.02% to 45.21% of miRNAs were differentially expressed in the progeny/O. longistaminatacomparisons, of which nearly half were down-regulated. Most of the DEGs and differentially expressed miRNAs showed expression levels close to that ofO. sativa, indicating that the expression of genes and miRNAs in progenies was closely related to their chromosome complements and that the miRNAs were more susceptible than the genes to the effects of genomic composition. Furthermore, a larger number of target genes were predicted in the progeny/O. longistaminatacomparisons. Finally, we found that the expression of some genes and miRNAs might increase the possibility for abiotic stress responses and adaptation in progenies. Together, our findings increase the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of hybridization and backcrossing on the expression levels of genes and miRNAs in rice leaves.

AGRONOMY-BASEL	pigeonpea; genomics; TPGC; FPVS; multi-location trials	Pigeonpea is one of the important pulse crops grown in many states of India and plays a major role in sustainable food and nutritional security for the smallholder farmers. In order to overcome the productivity barrier the Translational Pigeonpea Genomics Consortium (TPGC) was established, representing research institutes from six different states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh) of India. To enhance pigeonpea productivity and production the team has been engaged in deploying modern genomics approaches in breeding and popularizing modern varieties in farmers' fields. For instance, new genetic stock has been developed for trait mapping and molecular breeding initiated for enhancing resistance to fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease in 11 mega varieties of pigeonpea. In parallel, genomic segments associated with cleistogamous flower, shriveled seed, pods per plant, seeds per pod, 100 seed weight, and seed protein content have been identified. Furthermore, 100 improved lines were evaluated for yield and desirable traits in multi-location trials in different states. Furthermore, a total of 303 farmers' participatory varietal selection (FPVS) trials have been conducted in 129 villages from 15 districts of six states with 16 released varieties/hybrids. Additionally, one line (GRG 152 or Bheema) from multi-location trials has been identified by the All India Coordinated Research Project on Pigeonpea (AICRP-Pigeonpea) and released for cultivation by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC). In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups through TPGC is accelerating genetics gains in breeding plots and is expected to deliver them to pigeonpea farmers to enhance their income and improve livelihood.

The landraces of maize; which have not served as sources of improved germplasm; are invaluable sources of novel genetic variability crucial for achieving this objective. The overall goal of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of a maize panel of 208 accessions; comprising landrace gene pools from Burkina Faso (58), Ghana (43), and Togo (89), together with reference populations (18) from the maize improvement program of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Genotyping the maize panel with 5974 DArTseq-SNP markers revealed immense genetic diversity indicated by average expected heterozygosity (0.36), observed heterozygosity (0.5), and polymorphic information content (0.29). Model-based population structure; neighbor-joining tree; discriminant analysis of principal component; and principal coordinate analyses all separated the maize panel into three major sub-populations; each capable of providing a wide range of allelic variation. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 86% of the variation was within individuals; while 14% was attributable to differences among gene pools. The Burkinabe gene pool was strongly differentiated from all the others (genetic differentiation values >0.20), with no gene flow (Nm) to the reference populations (Nm = 0.98). Thus; this gene pool could be a target for novel genetic variation for maize improvement. The results of the present study confirmed the potential of this maize panel as an invaluable genetic resource for future design of association mapping studies to speed-up the introgression of this novel variation into the existing breeding pipelines.

Brion, C; Caradec, C; Pflieger, D; Friedrich, A; Schacherer, J	Pervasive Phenotypic Impact of a Large Nonrecombining Introgressed Region in Yeast	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	genotype; phenotype; introgressions; QTL; sex chromosome; yeast	To explore the origin of the diversity observed in natural populations, many studies have investigated the relationship between genotype and phenotype. In yeast species, especially in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these studies are mainly conducted using recombinant offspring derived from two genetically diverse isolates, allowing to define the phenotypic effect of genetic variants. However, large genomic variants such as interspecies introgressions are usually overlooked even if they are known to modify the genotype-phenotype relationship. To have a better insight into the overall phenotypic impact of introgressions, we took advantage of the presence of a 1-Mb introgressed region, which lacks recombination and contains the mating-type determinant in the Lachancea kluyveri budding yeast. By performing linkage mapping analyses in this species, we identified a total of 89 loci affecting growth fitness in a large number of conditions and 2,187 loci affecting gene expression mostly grouped into two major hotspots, one being the introgressed region carrying the mating-type locus. Because of the absence of recombination, our results highlight the presence of a sexual dimorphism in a budding yeast for the first time. Overall, by describing the phenotype-genotype relationship in the Lachancea kluyveri species, we expanded our knowledge on how genetic characteristics of large introgression events can affect the phenotypic landscape.

Breeding for fruit flavor is difficult because it is a quantitatively inherited trait influenced by taste, aroma and environmental factors. A lack of genetic diversity in modern tomato cultivars also necessitates exploration of new sources for flavor alleles. Wild tomato S. pimpinellifolium and inbred backcross lines were assessed for individual sugars and organic acids which are two of the main components of tomato flavor. S. pimpinellifolium was found to harbor alleles that could be used to increase glucose and fructose content and adjust acidity by altering malic and citric acid levels. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers were used to detect 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for sugars and 71 for organic acids. Confirmation was provided by comparing map locations with previously identified loci. Thus, seven (50 %) of the sugar QTLs and 22 (31 %) of the organic acids loci were supported by analyses in other tomato populations. Examination of the genomic sequence containing the QTLs allowed identification of potential candidate genes for several flavor components.

Satokangas, I; Martin, SH; Helantera, H; Saramaki, J; Kulmuni, J	Multi-locus interactions and the build-up of reproductive isolation	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	multi-locus interactions; networks; speciation; reproductive isolation; epistasis; incompatibility	All genes interact with other genes, and their additive effects and epistatic interactions affect an organism's phenotype and fitness. Recent theoretical and empirical work has advanced our understanding of the role of multi-locus interactions in speciation. However, relating different models to one another and to empirical observations is challenging. This review focuses on multi-locus interactions that lead to reproductive isolation (RI) through reduced hybrid fitness. We first review theoretical approaches and show how recent work incorporating a mechanistic understanding of multi-locus interactions recapitulates earlier models, but also makes novel predictions concerning the build-up of RI. These include high variance in the build-up rate of RI among taxa, the emergence of strong incompatibilities producing localized barriers to introgression, and an effect of population size on the build-up of RI. We then review recent experimental approaches to detect multi-locus interactions underlying RI using genomic data. We argue that future studies would benefit from overlapping methods like ancestry disequilibrium scans, genome scans of differentiation and analyses of hybrid gene expression. Finally, we highlight a need for further overlap between theoretical and empirical work, and approaches that predict what kind of patterns multi-locus interactions resulting in incompatibilities will leave in genome-wide polymorphism data.

Viard, F; Riginos, C; Bierne, N	Anthropogenic hybridization at sea: three evolutionary questions relevant to invasive species management	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	biological invasions; speciation; propagule pressure; hybrid zone; artificial habitats; marine	Species introductions promote secondary contacts between taxa with long histories of allopatric divergence. Anthropogenic contact zones thus offer valuable contrasts to speciation studies in natural systems where past spatial isolations may have been brief or intermittent. Investigations of anthropogenic hybridization are rare for marine animals, which have high fecundity and high dispersal ability, characteristics that contrast to most terrestrial animals. Genomic studies indicate that gene flow can still occur after millions of years of divergence, as illustrated by invasive mussels and tunicates. In this context, we highlight three issues: (i) the effects of high propagule pressure and demographic asymmetries on introgression directionality, (ii) the role of hybridization in preventing introduced species spread, and (iii) the importance of postzygotic barriers in maintaining reproductive isolation. Anthropogenic contact zones offer evolutionary biologists unprecedented large scale hybridization experiments. In addition to breaking the highly effective reproductive isolating barrier of spatial segregation, they allow researchers to explore unusual demographic contexts with strong asymmetries. The outcomes are diverse, from introgression swamping to strong barriers to gene flow, and lead to local containment or widespread invasion. These outcomes should not be neglected in management policies of marine invasive species.

In river networks, studying evolutionary processes in hybrid zones can be especially challenging, given the influence of past and current river properties along with biological species-specific traits. Here, we suggest that a natural hybrid zone between two divergent lineages of the sexually dimorphic Neotropical fishNematocharax venustuswas probably established by secondary contact as a result of a river capture event between the Contas and Pardo river basins. This putative river capture is supported by hydrogeological evidence of elbows of capture, wind gaps and geological faults. The morphological (colour pattern) and genetic (mtDNA and RADseq) variation reveal a clinal transition between parental lineages along the main river, with predominance of F2 hybrids at the centre of the hybrid zone, absence of early generation backcrosses and different levels of hybridization in the tributaries. We highlight that different sources of information are crucial for understanding how the riverscape spatial history influences the connectivity between and within river systems and, consequently, the dynamics of gene flow between freshwater lineages/species.

In this study, we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to evaluate genetic diversity, population structure, and infer demographic history of the endangered tree,Phoebe zhennanwhich is distributed around the Sichuan Basin. Genomic patterns revealed two distinct clusters, each largely confined to the West and East. Despite sympatry of the two genomic clusters at some sites, individuals show little or no evidence of genomic introgression. Demographic modeling supported an initial divergence time between the West and East lineages at similar to 15.08 Ma with further diversification within the West lineage at similar to 7.12 Ma. These times largely coincide with the two independent intensifications of the East Asian monsoon that were initiated during the middle (Langhian) and late Miocene (Messinian), respectively. These results suggest that the Miocene intensification phases of the East Asian monsoon played a pivotal role in shaping the current landscape-level patterns of genetic diversity withinP. zhennan, as has been found for the interspecific divergence of other subtropical Chinese plants. Based on isolation-by-distance and species distribution modeling, we hypothesize thatP. zhennanfollowed a ring diversification which was facilitated by the Sichuan Basin acting as barrier to gene flow. In situ and ex situ conservation management plans should consider the results obtained in this study to help secure the future of this beautiful and culturally significant endangered tree.

Amanullah, S; Saroj, A; Osae, BA; Liu, S; Liu, HY; Gao, P; Luan, FS	Detection of putative QTL regions associated with ovary traits in melon using SNP-CAPS markers	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	QTL; SNP; CAPS markers; Genetic map; Melon; Ovary traits	Genetic basis of melon morphology has been well-studied over the past few years. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based genetic markers are widely being used for QTLs and gene(s) detection. In this study, we reported genetic linkage mapping and QTLs detection of ovary-related traits in melon using whole genome resequencing and newly developed SNPs based cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) markers. Resequencing analysis exhibited that two distinct parental lines of melon covered 97.48% and 96.02% of reference genome, and total 302,684 major SNPs yielded 3519 CAPS loci. An F-2 mapping population of 156 individuals was genotyped for genetic linkage mapping with novel 149 SNP-CAPS markers, and spanning total 4072 cM distance and 27.32 cM in average b/w adjacent markers on 12 chromosomes. In total, 7 detected QTLs on different chromosomes (1, 5, 7, 8 and 11) explained 4.10%-17.78% phenotypic variations for 5 ovary-related traits and QTL region for ovary hairs density on chromosome 7 is mapped first time in this study. The detected QTLs regions revealed total 134 genes at different narrow genomic regions (365.28 (OVL), 343.89 (OVW), 23.47 (OVS), 107.05 (OVHD) and 597.09 (OVHL)) in kbp b/w adjacent CAPS markers on various chromosomes. Normal distribution frequency and highly significant correlation was also noticed in phenotypic analysis. Our results provide the theoretical basis of multiple QTL insights for ovary-related traits in melon and could be further investigated in unexplored botanical groups of melon by cloning and functional characterization in future studies.

Streicher, JW; Day, JJ	The toad's warts: Discordance creates bumpy expectations of mitochondrial-nuclear evolution between species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	amphibians; cytonuclear interactions; incomplete lineage sorting; introgression; phylogeography; population genetics; spatial discordance; systematics	Discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is a prevalent phenomenon in nature, in which the underlying processes responsible are considered to be important in shaping genetic variation in natural populations. Among the evolutionary processes that best explain such genomic mismatches incomplete lineage sorting and introgression are commonly identified, however, many studies are unable to distinguish between these hypotheses, which has become a major challenge in the field. In this issue ofMolecular Ecology, Firneno et al. (2020) present an elegant exploration of mitochondrial-nuclear discordance in Mesoamerican toads. Integrating genome-scale and spatial data to test between these hypotheses within an empirical model testing framework, they find strong support that incomplete lineage sorting explains the observed discordance. Their work, along with many previous articles inMolecular Ecology, highlights the commonality of mito-nuclear discordance among species despite the expectations of tightly concerted mitochondrial and nuclear genome evolution. It is increasingly clear that the nuclear genomes of many species are (at least for short periods of evolutionary time) functionally compatible with multiple, divergent mitochondrial haplotypes. As such, we suggest future research not only seeks to understand the processes causing spatial mito-nuclear discordance (e.g. incomplete lineage sorting, introgression), but also explores those that maintain discordance through time and space (e.g. relaxed selection on mito-nuclear interactions, heterozygosity, population demographics). We also discuss the vital role that taxonomy plays in interpreting patterns of mito-nuclear discordance when data-consistent yet differing taxonomies are used, such as treating allopatrically distributed taxa as multiple isolated populations versus multiple micro-endemic species.

Marin, J; Achaz, G; Crombach, A; Lambert, A	The genomic view of diversification	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	coalescent theory; gene flow; gene tree; gene-based diversification model; introgression; multispecies coalescent; phylogeny; population genetics; speciation; species tree	The process of species diversification is traditionally summarized by a single tree, the species tree, whose reconstruction from molecular data is hindered by frequent conflicts between gene genealogies. Here, we argue that instead of seeing these conflicts as nuisances, we can exploit them to inform the diversification process itself. We adopt a gene-based view of diversification to model the ubiquitous presence of gene flow between diverging lineages, one of the most important processes explaining disagreements among gene trees. We propose a new framework for modelling the joint evolution of gene and species lineages relaxing the hierarchy between the species tree and gene trees inherent to the standard view, as embodied in a popular model known as the multispecies coalescent (MSC). We implement this framework in two alternative models called the gene-based diversification models (GBD): (a) GBD-forward following all evolving genomes through time and (b) GBD-backward based on coalescent theory. They feature four parameters tuning colonization, gene flow, genetic drift and genetic differentiation. We propose an inference method based on differences between gene trees. Applied to two empirical data sets prone to gene flow, we find better support for the GBD-backward model than for the MSC model. Along with the increasing awareness of the extent of gene flow, this work shows the importance of considering the richer signal contained in genomic histories, rather than in the mere species tree, to better apprehend the complex evolutionary history of species.

Over the past few years, ILs exhibiting increased content of ascorbic acid in the fruit have been selected, among which the sub-line R182. The aims of this work were to identify the genes of the wild donorS. pennelliiharbored by the sub-line and to detect genes controlling ascorbic acid accumulation by using genomics tools. A Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) approach confirmed that no wild introgressions were present in the sub-line besides one region on chromosome 7. By using a dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map obtained by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), the wild region of the sub-line was finely identified; thus, defining 39 wild genes that replaced 33 genes of the ILs genetic background (cv. M82). The differentially expressed genes mapping in the region and the variants detected among the cultivated and the wild alleles evidenced the potential role of the novel genes present in the wild region. Interestingly, one upregulated gene, annotated as a major facilitator superfamily protein, showed a novel structure in R182, with respect to the parental lines. These genes will be further investigated using gene editing strategies.	GENES-BASEL		10.3390/genes11080847	  			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE
Mughal, MR; Koch, H; Huang, JG; Chiaromonte, F; DeGiorgio, M	Learning the properties of adaptive regions with functional data analysis	PLOS GENETICS		Author summary As populations adapt to their environments, specific patterns indicating selection remain in the distribution of genetic diversity across their genomes. A hallmark of positive natural selection is the reduction of genetic diversity surrounding beneficial mutations. The origin of the beneficial mutation, or whether it originated in a population being examined or within another, can be uncovered through the spatial distribution of the reduction of genetic diversity. In addition, other information about the strength, timing, and initial frequency of beneficial mutations can be learned by examining patterns of diversity across genomic regions. We use functional data analysis to capture differences among the spatial distributions of genetic variation expected by diverse evolutionary processes, and further apply it to dissect how selection parameters affect such patterns. Using this method, we learn the underlying origins, timings, and strengths of beneficial mutations that have impacted modern human genomic diversity. Identifying regions of positive selection in genomic data remains a challenge in population genetics. Most current approaches rely on comparing values of summary statistics calculated in windows. We present an approach termedSURFDAWave, which translates measures of genetic diversity calculated in genomic windows to functional data. By transforming our discrete data points to be outputs of continuous functions defined over genomic space, we are able to learn the features of these functions that signify selection. This enables us to confidently identify complex modes of natural selection, including adaptive introgression. We are also able to predict important selection parameters that are responsible for shaping the inferred selection events. By applying our model to human population-genomic data, we recapitulate previously identified regions of selective sweeps, such asOCA2in Europeans, and predict that its beneficial mutation reached a frequency of 0.02 before it swept 1,802 generations ago, a time when humans were relatively new to Europe. In addition, we identifyBNC2in Europeans as a target of adaptive introgression, and predict that it harbors a beneficial mutation that arose in an archaic human population that split from modern humans within the hypothesized modern human-Neanderthal divergence range.

Hubisz, MJ; Williams, AL; Siepel, A	Mapping gene flow between ancient hominins through demography-aware inference of the ancestral recombination graph	PLOS GENETICS		The sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes has yielded many new insights about interbreeding events between extinct hominins and the ancestors of modern humans. While much attention has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances of introgression leave more subtle genomic evidence and have received less attention. Here, we present a major extension of the ARGweaver algorithm, called ARGweaver-D, which can infer local genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic model that includes population splits and migration events. This Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topologies and branch lengths along the genome, but also indicate migrant lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore be parsed to produce probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that this method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into modern humans, even with only a few samples. We then show that the method can also detect introgressed regions stemming from older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply it to human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for signatures of older proposed migration events, including ancient humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic hominins into Denisovans. We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome that is putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these regions. Finally, we predict that 1% of the Denisovan genome was introgressed from an unsequenced, but highly diverged, archaic hominin ancestor. About 15% of these super-archaic regions-comprising at least about 4Mb-were, in turn, introgressed into modern humans and continue to exist in the genomes of people alive today. Author summary We present ARGweaver-D, an extension of the ARGweaver algorithm which can be applied under a user-defined demographic model including population splits and migration events. Given genome sequence data from a collection of individuals across multiple closely related populations or subspecies, ARGweaver-D can infer trees describing the genetic relationships among these individuals at every location along the genome, conditional on the demographic model. Like ARGweaver, ARGweaver-D is a Bayesian method, sampling trees from the posterior distribution in order to account for uncertainty. Using simulations, we show that ARGweaver-D can successfully identify regions introgressed from Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans. It is also well-powered to detect introgressed regions stemming from older gene-flow events. We apply ARGweaver-D to the genomes of two Neanderthals, a Denisovan, and two African humans. We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome which is likely derived from gene flow from ancient humans. We also identify about 1% of the Denisovan genome that may be traced to an unsequenced archaic hominin; 15% of these regions were subsequently passed to modern humans. We find no convincing evidence that selection acted against any of these introgressed regions.	PLOS GENET		10.1371/journal.pgen.1008895	  			TRUE	TRUE	methods paper	FALSE			FALSE

Two different species of tunicates in the same ascidian genus,Ciona robustaandCiona intestinalis, can produce hybrids. However, wild sympatric populations display limited gene flow, suggesting the existence of obstacles to interspecific reproduction that remain unknown. Here, we took advantage of a closed culture system to crossC. robustawithC. intestinalisand established F1 and F2 hybrids. We monitored post-embryonic development, survival, and sexual maturation to characterize the genetic basis of simple traits, and further probe the physiological mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation. Partial viability of first and second generation hybrids suggested that both pre- and postzygotic mechanisms contributed to genomic incompatibilities in hybrids. We observed asymmetric fitness, whereby theC. intestinalismaternal lines fared more poorly in our system, pointing to maternal origins of species-specific sensitivity. We discuss the possibility that asymmetrical second generation inviability and infertility emerge from interspecific incompatibilities between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, or other maternal effect genes. This work paves the way to quantitative genetic approaches to study the mechanisms underlying genomic incompatibilities and other complex traits in the genome-enabledCionamodel.

It is a polycyclic pathogen with the ability to rapidly evolve new virulent strains in response to resistance genes deployed in commercial cultivars. Hence, introgression and pyramiding of different loci for resistance (qualitative or quantitative) through marker-assisted selection is an effective way to improve scald resistance in barley. This review summarizes all 148 resistance quantitative trait loci reported at the date of submission of this review and projects them onto the barley physical map, where it is clear many loci co-locate on chromosomes 3H and 7H. We have summarized the major named resistance loci and reiterated the renaming ofRrs15(CI8288) toRrs17. This review provides a comprehensive resource for future discovery and breeding efforts of qualitative and quantitative scald resistance loci.

The Mexican golden trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster), one of the southernmost native salmonid species in the world, is susceptible to climate change, habitat perturbations and the competition and hybridization with exotic rainbow trout (O. mykiss). The present study aimed for the first time to use genotyping-by-sequencing to explore the effect of genetic hybridization withO. mykissand of riverscape and climatic variables on the genetic variation amongO. chrysogasterpopulations. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was applied to generate 9767 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genotyping 272O. chrysogasterandO. mykiss. Population genomics analyses were combined with landscape ecology approaches into a riverine context (riverscape genetics). The clustering analyses detected seven different genetic groups (six forO. chrysogaterand one for aquacultureO. mykiss) and a small amount of admixture between aquaculture and native trout with only two native genetic clusters showing exotic introgression. Latitude and precipitation of the driest month had a significant negative effect on genetic diversity and evidence of isolation by river resistance was detected, suggesting that the landscape heterogeneity was preventing trout dispersal, both for native and exotic individuals. Moreover, several outlier SNPs were identified as potentially implicated in local adaptation to local hydroclimatic variables. Overall, this study suggests thatO. chrysogatermay require conservation planning given (i) exotic introgression fromO. mykisslocally threateningO. chrysogatergenetic integrity, and (ii) putative local adaptation but low genetic diversity and hence probably reduced evolutionary potential especially in a climate change context.

Although classically recognized as significant in speciation and adaptation, recognition of the importance of interspecific gene flow has dramatically increased during the genomics era, concomitant with an unending flood of empirical examples, with or without genome doubling. Interspecific gene flow is thus increasingly thought to lead to evolutionary innovation and diversification, via adaptive introgression, homoploid hybrid speciation and allopolyploid speciation. Less well understood, however, are the suite of genetic and genomic mechanisms set in motion by the merger of differentiated genomes, and the temporal scale over which recombinational complexity mediated by gene flow might be expressed and exposed to natural selection. We focus on these issues here, considering the types of molecular genetic and genomic processes that might be set in motion by the saltational event of genome merger between two diverged species, either with or without genome doubling, and how these various processes can contribute to novel phenotypes. Genetic mechanisms include the infusion of new alleles and the genesis of novel structural variation including translocations and inversions, homoeologous exchanges, transposable element mobilization and novel insertional effects, presence-absence variation and copy number variation. Polyploidy generates massive transcriptomic and regulatory alteration, presumably set in motion by disrupted stoichiometries of regulatory factors, small RNAs and other genome interactions that cascade from single-gene expression change up through entire networks of transformed regulatory modules. We highlight both these novel combinatorial possibilities and the range of temporal scales over which such complexity might be generated, and thus exposed to natural selection and drift.

Uddin, MN; Fukuta, Y	A Region on Chromosome 7 Related to Differentiation of Rice (Oryza sativaL.) Between Lowland and Upland Ecotypes	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	differentiation; upland; lowland; ecosystems; plant architecture; rice (Oryza sativaL; )	Due to global population expansion and climate change impacts, the development of a stable yielding variety that adapts well to unfavorable conditions for rice cultivation, can contribute to sustainable and stable production in rice (Oryza sativaL.). Understanding genetic differentiations to ecotypes for rice cultivations, such as upland, rainfed lowland, and irrigated lowland, is very important to develop the breeding materials for adapting to each environmental condition. The upland landrace variety basically has low tiller/panicle numbers and a large panicle, and the plant architecture is different from that of the lowland variety. The tiller and panicle numbers have been considered as one of the most difficult traits for genetic changes artificially in rice breeding. A low tiller recessive geneltn2originated from a New Plant Type variety, IR 65600-87-2-23, harboring segments from an upland variety, Ketan Lumbu (Tropical Japonica Group), was found on chromosome 7, and the other QTLs for culm length, culm weight, panicle length, panicle weight, seed fertility, harvest index, and soil surface rooting were also detected in the same chromosome region. These low tiller genes and the other QTLs were estimated to play an important role in developing the architecture for upland rice. Some QTLs for root growth angle,DRO3andqSFR7, were also found in the same chromosome region from upland varieties categorized into the Tropical Japonica Group, and the QTLs may also be relevant to upland adaptation together with other traits. Previous studies using high throughput re-sequencing (whole genome variation data) of a large batch of rice accessions could identify the ecotype differentiated genomic regions (EDRs) and Ecotype differentiated genes (EDGs) such asOs07g0449700, a type response regulator, which is critical in upland adaptation in the same region of chromosome 7. Two selective loci,E3735andE4208, for upland and lowland differentiation, and their corresponding genesOs07g0260000andOs07g0546500were also detected on chromosome 7 by drought-responding EST-SSRs. These findings indicate that the region on chromosome 7 is highly possible to related to the plant shoot and root architecture in the upland rice variety that has an important role and differentiates between upland and lowland ecotypes.

In this study, we review recent literature on the origin and phylogeny, domestication and dispersal of the three majorBosspecies - taurine cattle, zebu and yak - and their genetic interactions. The global dispersion of taurine and zebu cattle was accompanied by population bottlenecks, which resulted in a marked phylogeographic differentiation of the mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal DNA. The high diversity of European breeds has been shaped through isolation-by-distance, different production objectives, breed formation and the expansion of popular breeds. The overlapping and broad ranges of taurine and zebu cattle led to hybridization with each other and with other bovine species. For instance, Chinese gayal carries zebu mitochondrial DNA; several Indonesian zebu descend from zebu bull x banteng cow crossings; Tibetan cattle and yak have exchanged gene variants; and about 5% of the American bison contain taurine mtDNA. Analysis at the genomic level indicates that introgression may have played a role in environmental adaptation.	ANIM GENET		10.1111/age.12974	  			TRUE	TRUE	review paper	FALSE			FALSE

Most of these methods are either designed for one or the other case, which may impair the study of combined cases. Here, we introduce a series of versatile genome-scan methods applicable for both cases, the detection of selection and introgression. The proposed approaches are based on nonparametrick-nearest neighbour (kNN) techniques, while incorporating pairwise Fixation Index (F-ST) and pairwise nucleotide differences (d(xy)) as features. We benchmark our methods using a wide range of simulation scenarios, with varying parameters, such as recombination rates, population background histories, selection strengths, the proportion of introgression and the time of gene flow. We find that kNN-based methods perform remarkably well compared with thestate-of-the-art. Finally, we demonstrate how to perform kNN-based genome scans on real-world genomic data using the population genomics R-packagepopgenome.

The cultivated potato is susceptible and lacks resistance to bacterial wilt (BW), a soil-borne disease caused byRalstonia solanacearum.It also has interspecies incompatibility withinSolanaceaeplants. Previously, we have successfully conducted the protoplast fusion of potato and eggplant and regenerated somatic hybrids that showing resistance to eggplant BW. For efficient use of these novel germplasm and improve BW resistance of cultivated potato, it is essential to dissect the genetic basis of the resistance to BW obtained from eggplant. The strategy of combining genome composition and transcriptome analysis was established to explore the gene that confers BW resistance to the hybrids. Genome composition of the 90 somatic hybrids was studied using genomic in situ hybridization coupled with 44 selected eggplant-specific SSRs (smSSRs). The analysis revealed a diverse set of genome combinations among the hybrids and showed a possibility of integration of alien genes along with the detection of 7 smSSRs linked to BW resistance (BW-linked SSRs) in the hybrids. Transcriptome comparison between the resistant and susceptible gene pools identified a BW resistance associated gene,smPGH1,which was significantly induced byR. solanacearumin the resistant pool. Remarkably,smPGH1was co-localized with the BW-linked SSR emh01E15 on eggplant chromosome 9, which was further confirmed thatsmPGH1was activated byR. solanacearumonly in the resistant hybrids. Taken together, the identified genesmPGH1and BW-linked SSRs have provided novel genetic resources that will aid in potato breeding for BW resistance.

Our understanding of the significance and prevalence of hybridization in nature has expanded with the generation and analysis of genome-spanning data sets. That said, most hybridization research still has restricted temporal and spatial resolution, which limits our ability to draw broad conclusions about evolutionary and conservation related outcomes. Here, we argue that rapidly advancing environmental DNA (eDNA) methodology could be adopted for studies of hybrid zones to increase temporal sampling (contemporary and historical), refine and geographically expand sampling density, and collect data for taxa that are difficult to directly sample. Genomic data in the environment offer the potential for near real-time biological tracking of hybrid zones, and eDNA provides broad, but as yet untapped, potential to address eco-evolutionary questions.

Baiz, MD; Tucker, PK; Mueller, JL; Cortes-Ortiz, L	X-Linked Signature of Reproductive Isolation in Humans is Mirrored in a Howler Monkey Hybrid Zone	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	speciation; genomic clines; sex chromosomes; gene flow; primates	Reproductive isolation is a fundamental step in speciation. While sex chromosomes have been linked to reproductive isolation in many model systems, including hominids, genetic studies of the contribution of sex chromosome loci to speciation for natural populations are relatively sparse. Natural hybrid zones can help identify genomic regions contributing to reproductive isolation, like hybrid incompatibility loci, since these regions exhibit reduced introgression between parental species. Here, we use a primate hybrid zone (Alouatta palliata x Alouatta pigra) to test for reduced introgression of X-linked SNPs compared to autosomal SNPs. To identify X-linked sequence in A. palliata, we used a sex-biased mapping approach with whole-genome re-sequencing data. We then used genomic cline analysis with reduced-representation sequence data for parental A. palliata and A. pigra individuals and hybrids (n = 88) to identify regions with non-neutral introgression. We identified similar to 26 Mb of non-repetitive, putatively X-linked genomic sequence in A. palliata, most of which mapped collinearly to the marmoset and human X chromosomes. We found that X-linked SNPs had reduced introgression and an excess of ancestry from A. palliata as compared to autosomal SNPs. One outlier region with reduced introgression overlaps a previously described desert of archaic hominin ancestry on the human X chromosome. These results are consistent with a large role for the X chromosome in speciation across animal taxa and further, suggest shared features in the genomic basis of the evolution of reproductive isolation in primates.

Debates have occurred over whether or not there should be two subspecies or species recognized due to its geographic variation in morphology. Even though the matamata is universally known, its natural history, conservation status and biogeography are largely unexplored. In this study we examined the phylogeographic differentiation of the matamata based on three mitochondrial DNA fragments (2168 bp of the control region, cytochrome oxidase subunit I, and the cytochrome b gene), one nuclear genomic DNA fragment (1068 bp of the R35 intron) and 1661 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Our molecular and morphological analyses revealed the existence of two distinct, genetically deeply divergent evolutionary lineages of matamatas that separated in the late Miocene (approximately 12.7 million years ago), corresponding well to the time when the Orinoco Basin was established. As a result of our analyses, we describe the genetically and morphologically highly distinct matamata from the Orinoco and Rio Negro Basins and the Essequibo drainage as a species new to science (Chelus orinocensis sp. nov.). Chelus fimbriata sensu stricto is distributed in the Amazon Basin and the Mahury drainage. Additionally, the analyses revealed that each species displays phylogeographic differentiation. For C. orinocensis, there is moderate mitochondrial differentiation between the Orinoco and the Rio Negro. For C. fimbriata, there is more pronounced differentiation matching different river systems. One mitochondrial clade was identified from the Amazon, Ucayali, and Mahury Rivers, and another one from the Madeira and Jaci Parana Rivers. The C. orinocensis in the Essequibo and Branco Rivers have haplotypes that constitute a third clade clustering with C. fimbriata. Phylogenetic analyses of the R35 intron and SNP data link the matamatas from the Essequibo and Branco with the new species, suggesting past gene flow and old mitochondrial introgression. Chelus orinocensis is collected for the pet trade in Colombia and Venezuela. However, neither the extent of the harvest nor its impact are known. Hence, it is crucial to gather more information and to assess its exploitation throughout its distribution range to obtain a better understanding of its conservation status and to design appropriate conservation and management procedures.

Gaire, R; Ohm, H; Brown-Guedira, G; Mohammadi, M	Identification of regions under selection and loci controlling agronomic traits in a soft red winter wheat population	PLANT GENOME		Comprehensive information of a breeding population is a necessity to design promising crosses. This study was conducted to characterize a soft red winter wheat breeding population that was subject of intensive germplasm introductions and introgression from exotic germplasm. We used genome-wide markers and phenotypic assessment to identify signatures of selection and loci controlling agronomic traits in a soft red winter wheat population. The study of linkage disequilibrium (LD) revealed that the extent of LD and its decay varied among chromosomes with chromosomes 2B and 7D showing the most extended islands of high-LD with slow rates of decay. Four sub-populations, two with North American origin and two with Australian and Chinese origins, were identified. Genome-wide scans for selection signatures using F-ST and hapFLK identified 13 genomic regions under selection, of which five loci (LT, Fr-A2, Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn3) were associated with environmental adaptation and two loci were associated with disease resistance genes (Sr36 and Fhb1). Genome-wide association studies identified major loci controlling yield and yield related traits. For days to heading and plant height, major loci with effects sizes of 2.2 days and 5 cm were identified on chromosomes 7B and 6A respectively. For test weight, number of spikes per square meter, and number of kernels per square meter, large effect loci were identified on chromosomes 1A, 4B, and 5A, respectively. However, for yield alone, no major loci were detected. A combination of selection for large effect loci for yield components and genomic selection could be a promising approach for yield improvement.

Yang, CJ; Sharma, R; Gorjanc, G; Hearne, S; Powell, W; Mackay, I	Origin Specific Genomic Selection: A Simple Process To Optimize the Favorable Contribution of Parents to Progeny	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	introgression; barley; maize; NAM; genomic selection; plant breeding; Genomic Prediction; GenPred; Shared Data Resources	Modern crop breeding is in constant demand for new genetic diversity as part of the arms race with genetic gain. The elite gene pool has limited genetic variation and breeders are trying to introduce novelty from unadapted germplasm, landraces and wild relatives. For polygenic traits, currently available approaches to introgression are not ideal, as there is a demonstrable bias against exotic alleles during selection. Here, we propose a partitioned form of genomic selection, called Origin Specific Genomic Selection (OSGS), where we identify and target selection on favorable exotic alleles. Briefly, within a population derived from a bi-parental cross, we isolate alleles originating from the elite and exotic parents, which then allows us to separate out the predicted marker effects based on the allele origins. We validated the usefulness of OSGS using two nested association mapping (NAM) datasets: barley NAM (elite-exotic) and maize NAM (elite-elite), as well as by computer simulation. Our results suggest that OSGS works well in its goal to increase the contribution of favorable exotic alleles in bi-parental crosses, and it is possible to extend the approach to broader multi-parental populations.

Leonova, IN; Skolotneva, ES; Orlova, EA; Orlovskaya, OA; Salina, EA	Detection of Genomic Regions Associated with Resistance to Stem Rust in Russian Spring Wheat Varieties and Breeding Germplasm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES	wheat; Triticum aestivum; Puccinia graminis; introgression lines; GWAS; Srgenes	Stem rust caused byPuccinia graminisf. sp.triticiEriks. is a dangerous disease of common wheat worldwide. Development and cultivation of the varieties with genetic resistance is one of the most effective and environmentally important ways for protection of wheat against fungal pathogens. Field phytopathological screening and genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used for assessment of the genetic diversity of a collection of spring wheat genotypes on stem rust resistance loci. The collection consisting of Russian varieties of spring wheat and introgression lines with alien genetic materials was evaluated over three seasons (2016, 2017 and 2018) for resistance to the native population of stem rust specific to the West Siberian region of Russia. The results indicate that most varieties displayed from moderate to high levels of susceptibility toP. graminis; 16% of genotypes had resistance or immune response. In total, 13,006 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers obtained from the Infinium 15K array were used to perform genome-wide association analysis. GWAS detected 35 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) with SNPs located on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3B, 5A, 5B, 6A, 7A and 7B. The most significant associations were found on chromosomes 7A and 6A where known resistance genesSr25andSr6Ai = 2originated fromThinopyrumssp. are located. Common wheat lines containing introgressed fragments fromTriticum timopheeviiandTriticum kiharaewere found to carrySr36gene on 2B chromosome. It has been suggested that the quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapped to the chromosome 5BL may be new loci inherited from theT. timopheevii. It can be inferred that a number of Russian wheat varieties may contain theSr17gene, which does not currently provide effective protection against pathogen. This is the first report describing the results of analysis of the genetic factors conferring resistance of Russian spring wheat varieties to stem rust.

Riaz, S; Menendez, CM; Tenscher, A; Pap, D; Walker, MA	Genetic mapping and survey of powdery mildew resistance in the wild Central Asian ancestor of cultivated grapevines in Central Asia	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH		Cultivated grapevines (Vitis vinifera) lack resistance to powdery mildew (PM) with few exceptions. Resistance to this pathogen within V. vinifera has been reported in earlier studies and identified as the Ren1 locus in two Central Asian table grape accessions. Other PM-resistant cultivated varieties and accessions of the wild ancestor V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris were soon identified raising questions regarding the origin of the resistance. In this study, F1 breeding populations were developed with a PM susceptible V. vinifera subsp. vinifera breeding line and a PM-resistant subsp. sylvestris accession. Genotyping was carried out with five Ren1 locus linked SSR markers. A PM resistance locus explaining up to 96% of the phenotypic variation was identified in the same genomic position, where the Ren1 locus was previously reported. New SSR marker alleles linked with the resistance locus were identified. We report results of PM resistance in multiple accessions of subsp. sylvestris collected as seed lots or cuttings from five countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. A total of 20 females from 11 seed lots and 19 males from nine seed lots collected from Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan were resistant to PM. Three male and one female plant collected as cuttings from Afghanistan and Iran were also resistant to PM. Allelic analysis of markers linked with the Ren1 locus in conjunction with disease evaluation data found a high diversity of allelic haplotypes, which are only possible via recombination events occurring over a long time period. Sequence analysis of two alleles of the SSR marker that cosegregates with the resistance found SNPs that were present in the wild progenitor and in cultivated forms. Variable levels of PM resistance among the tested accessions were also observed. These lines of evidence suggest that the powdery mildew fungus may have been present in Asia for a longer time than currently thought, giving the wild progenitor V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris time to coevolve with and develop resistance to this pathogen.

Lutgen, D; Ritter, R; Olsen, RA; Schielzeth, H; Gruselius, J; Ewels, P; Garcia, JT; Shirihai, H; Schweizer, M; Suh, A; Burri, R	Linked-read sequencing enables haplotype-resolved resequencing at population scale	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	admixture; demography; introgression; phasing; population genomics; selective sweeps	The feasibility to sequence entire genomes of virtually any organism provides unprecedented insights into the evolutionary history of populations and species. Nevertheless, many population genomic inferences - including the quantification and dating of admixture, introgression and demographic events, and inference of selective sweeps - are still limited by the lack of high-quality haplotype information. The newest generation of sequencing technology now promises significant progress. To establish the feasibility of haplotype-resolved genome resequencing at population scale, we investigated properties of linked-read sequencing data of songbirds of the genusOenantheacross a range of sequencing depths. Our results based on the comparison of downsampled (25x, 20x, 15x, 10x, 7x, and 5x) with high-coverage data (46-68x) of seven bird genomes mapped to a reference suggest that phasing contiguities and accuracies adequate for most population genomic analyses can be reached already with moderate sequencing effort. At 15x coverage, phased haplotypes span about 90% of the genome assembly, with 50% and 90% of phased sequences located in phase blocks longer than 1.25-4.6 Mb (N50) and 0.27-0.72 Mb (N90). Phasing accuracy reaches beyond 99% starting from 15x coverage. Higher coverages yielded higher contiguities (up to about 7 Mb/1 Mb [N50/N90] at 25x coverage), but only marginally improved phasing accuracy. Phase block contiguity improved with input DNA molecule length; thus, higher-quality DNA may help keeping sequencing costs at bay. In conclusion, even for organisms with gigabase-sized genomes like birds, linked-read sequencing at moderate depth opens an affordable avenue towards haplotype-resolved genome resequencing at population scale.

Fang, BH; Kemppainen, P; Momigliano, P; Feng, XY; Merila, J	On the causes of geographically heterogeneous parallel evolution in sticklebacks	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION		The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is an important model system for the study of parallel evolution in the wild, having repeatedly colonized and adapted to freshwater from the sea throughout the northern hemisphere. Previous studies identified numerous genomic regions showing consistent genetic differentiation between freshwater and marine ecotypes but these had typically limited geographic sampling and mostly focused on the Eastern Pacific region. We analysed population genomic data from global samples of the three-spined stickleback marine and freshwater ecotypes to detect loci involved in parallel evolution at different geographic scales. Most signatures of parallel evolution were unique to the Eastern Pacific and trans-oceanic marine-freshwater differentiation was restricted to a limited number of shared genomic regions, including three chromosomal inversions. On the basis of simulations and empirical data, we demonstrate that this could result from the stochastic loss of freshwater-adapted alleles during the invasion of the Atlantic basin and selection against freshwater-adapted variants in the sea, both of which can reduce standing genetic variation available for freshwater adaptation outside the Eastern Pacific region. Moreover, the elevated linkage disequilibrium associated with marine-freshwater differentiation in the Eastern Pacific is consistent with secondary contact between marine and freshwater populations that evolved in isolation from each other during past glacial periods. Thus, contrary to what earlier studies from the Eastern Pacific region have led us to believe, parallel marine-freshwater differentiation in sticklebacks is far less prevalent and pronounced in all other parts of the species global distribution range. Population genomic data from a global dataset of three-spined sticklebacks show that parallel signatures of marine to freshwater differentiation are less common than previously thought.

Li, Z; Tirado, SB; Kadam, DC; Coffey, L; Miller, ND; Spalding, EP; Lorenz, AJ; de Leon, N; Kaeppler, SM; Schnable, PS; Springer, NM; Hirsch, CN	Characterizing introgression-by-environment interactions using maize near isogenic lines	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Key message Significant introgression-by-environment interactions are observed for traits throughout development from small introgressed segments of the genome. Relatively small genomic introgressions containing quantitative trait loci can have significant impacts on the phenotype of an individual plant. However, the magnitude of phenotypic effects for the same introgression can vary quite substantially in different environments due to introgression-by-environment interactions. To study potential patterns of introgression-by-environment interactions, fifteen near-isogenic lines (NILs) with > 90% B73 genetic background and multiple Mo17 introgressions were grown in 16 different environments. These environments included five geographical locations with multiple planting dates and multiple planting densities. The phenotypic impact of the introgressions was evaluated for up to 26 traits that span different growth stages in each environment to assess introgression-by-environment interactions. Results from this study showed that small portions of the genome can drive significant genotype-by-environment interaction across a wide range of vegetative and reproductive traits, and the magnitude of the introgression-by-environment interaction varies across traits. Some introgressed segments were more prone to introgression-by-environment interaction than others when evaluating the interaction on a whole plant basis throughout developmental time, indicating variation in phenotypic plasticity throughout the genome. Understanding the profile of introgression-by-environment interaction in NILs is useful in consideration of how small introgressions of QTL or transgene containing regions might be expected to impact traits in diverse environments.

Hernandez, J; Meints, B; Hayes, P	Introgression Breeding in Barley: Perspectives and Case Studies	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	genetic resources; multi-rust resistance; haplotype; high throughput genotyping; genetic diversity; genetic mapping	Changing production scenarios resulting from unstable climatic conditions are challenging crop improvement efforts. A deeper and more practical understanding of plant genetic resources is necessary if these assets are to be used effectively in developing improved varieties. In general, current varieties and potential varieties have a narrow genetic base, making them prone to suffer the consequences of new and different abiotic and biotic stresses that can reduce crop yield and quality. The deployment of genomic technologies and sophisticated statistical analysis procedures has generated a dramatic change in the way we characterize and access genetic diversity in crop plants, including barley. Various mapping strategies can be used to identify the genetic variants that lead to target phenotypes and these variants can be assigned coordinates in reference genomes. In this way, new genes and/or new alleles at known loci present in wild ancestors, germplasm accessions, land races, and un-adapted introductions can be located and targeted for introgression. In principle, the introgression process can now be streamlined and linkage drag reduced. In this review, we present an overview of (1) past and current efforts to identify diversity that can be tapped to improve barley yield and quality, and (2) case studies of our efforts to introgress resistance to stripe and stem rust from un-adapted germplasm. We conclude with a description of a modified Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population strategy that we are implementing for the development of multi-use naked barley for organic systems and share perspectives on the use of genome editing in introgression breeding.

Assessment of genetic diversity in the wild gene pool of lentil, as well as characterization of useful and novel alleles/genes that can be introgressed into elite germplasm, presents new opportunities and pathways for germplasm enhancement, followed by successful crop improvement. In the current study, a lentil collection consisting of 467 wild and cultivated accessions that originated from 10 diverse geographical regions was assessed, to understand genetic relationships among different lentil species/subspecies. A total of 422,101 high-confidence SNP markers were identified against the reference lentil genome (cv. CDC Redberry). Phylogenetic analysis clustered the germplasm collection into four groups, namely,Lens culinaris/Lens orientalis,Lens lamottei/Lens odemensis,Lens ervoides, andLens nigricans. A weak correlation was observed between geographical origin and genetic relationship, except for some accessions ofL.culinarisandL.ervoides. Genetic distance matrices revealed a comparable level of variation within the gene pools ofL.culinaris(Nei's coefficient 0.01468-0.71163),L.ervoides(Nei's coefficient 0.01807-0.71877), andL.nigricans(Nei's coefficient 0.02188-1.2219). In order to understand any genic differences at species/subspecies level, allele frequencies were calculated from a subset of 263 lentil accessions. Among all cultivated and wild lentil species,L.nigricansexhibited the greatest allelic differentiation across the genome compared to all other species/subspecies. Major differences were observed on six genomic regions with the largest being on Chromosome 1 (c. 1 Mbp). These results indicate thatL. nigricansis the most distantly related toL. culinarisand additional structural variations are likely to be identified from genome sequencing studies. This would provide further insights into evolutionary relationships between cultivated and wild lentil germplasm, for germplasm improvement and introgression.

A new leaf rust resistance gene tentatively named LrM was introgressed from the diploid non-progenitor species Ae. markgrafii (2n = 2x = 14, genome CC) into common wheat using the nulli-5B mechanism. The introgression line ER9-700 showed a high degree of resistance against a wide spectrum of Puccinia triticina pathotypes. Genetic analysis was performed using the F-1, F-2, F-2:3 and BC1F1 generations derived from the cross ER9-700/Agra Local. The results showed a single dominant gene for leaf rust resistance. The resistance gene LrM was mapped on chromosome arm 2AS using SSR- and SNP-based PCR markers. Preliminary mapping with SSR markers in the F-2:3 population from the cross ER9-700/Agra Local identified two SSR markers flanking the LrM. SNPs were identified in the genomic region flanked by SSR markers, and SNP-based PCR markers were developed to construct the final map. Three SNP-based PCR markers co-segregated and mapped closest to the resistance gene at a distance of 2 cM. The gene LrM was distinguished from all the other genes designated and mapped on chromosome arm 2AS by molecular markers and rust reaction. All five markers used in the mapping amplified identical alleles in the donor Ae. markgrafii accession and introgression line ER9-700. The chromosomal location and rust reaction suggest that LrM is a novel leaf rust resistance gene that may be useful in broadening the genetic base of leaf rust resistance in wheat.

However, the existence of continuous phenotypic variation in widespread species challenges accurate species delimitation based on classical taxonomy. In this study, we investigated the cryptic diversity of a widespread herb (Roscoea tibetica Batalin) in a biodiversity hotspot (the Hengduan Mountains, China) using genotyping by sequencing, examining morphological traits, developing species distribution models, and simulating demographic history. Phylogenomic reconstruction, principal component analysis, and genetic structure inferences indicated that previously reported R. tibetica comprised two monophyletic lineages with a deep divergence. Several morphological diagnostic characteristics were discovered from field and common garden that corresponded to these independent evolutionary lineages. Species distribution models illustrated significant ecological divergence between both lineages. All evidence strongly supported that R. tibetica, as described in previous taxonomy, actually comprises two distinct species. Model test of gene flow and effective population size changes in fastsimcoal2, and a negative Tajima's D-value suggested that recent contact likely occurred between the two lineages. Our results proposed that cryptic diversity in previously reported R. tibetica was possibly associated with phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments and morphological convergence in similar habitats. This study suggests that caution should be exercised when attempting to gain biological insight into species with large-scale morphological variation, and species delimitation should be done in advance.

Abbasi, J; Xu, JL; Dehghani, H; Luo, MC; Deal, KR; McGuire, PE; Dvorak, J	Introgression of perennial growth habit from Lophopyrum elongatum into wheat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Key message A locus for perennial growth was mapped on Lophopyrum elongatum chromosome arm 4ES and introgressed into the wheat genome. Evidence was obtained that in addition to chromosome 4E, other L. elongatum chromosomes control perennial growth. Monocarpy versus polycarpy is one of the fundamental developmental dichotomies in flowering plants. Advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of this dichotomy are important for basic biological reasons and practically for genetic manipulation of growth development in economically important plants. Nine wheat introgression lines (ILs) harboring germplasm of the Lophopyrum elongatum genome present in the octoploid amphiploid Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (subgenomes AABBDD) x L. elongatum (genomes EE) were selected from a population of ILs developed earlier. These ILs were employed here in genomic analyses of post-sexual cycle regrowth (PSCR), which is a component of polycarpy in caespitose L. elongatum. Analyses of disomic substitution (DS) lines confirmed that L. elongatum chromosome 4E confers PSCR on wheat. The gene was mapped into a short distal region of L. elongatum arm 4ES and was tentatively named Pscr1. ILs harboring recombined chromosomes with 4ES segments, including Pscr1, incorporated into the distal part of the 4DS chromosome arm were identified. Based on the location, Pscr1 is not orthologous with the rice rhizome-development gene Rhz2 located on rice chromosome Os3, which is homoeologous with chromosome 4E, but it may correspond to the Teosinte branched1 (TB1) gene, which is located in the introgressed region in the L. elongatum and Ae. tauschii genomes. A hexaploid IL harboring a large portion of the E-genome but devoid of chromosome 4E also expressed PSCR, which provided evidence that perennial growth is controlled by genes on other L. elongatum chromosomes in addition to 4E.

The management and exploration of these large-scale genomic variation data require programming skills. The public genotype querying databases of many species are usually centralized and implemented independently, making them difficult to update with new data over time. Currently, there is a lack of a widely used framework for setting up user-friendly web servers to explore new genomic variation data in diverse species. Results: Here, we present SnpHub, a Shiny/R-based server framework for retrieving, analysing, and visualizing large-scale genomic variation data that can be easily set up on any Linux server. After a pre-building process based on the provided VCF files and genome annotation files, the local server allows users to interactively access single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions with annotation information by locus or gene and to define sample sets through a web page. Users can freely analyse and visualize genomic variations in heatmaps, phylogenetic trees, haplotype networks, or geographical maps. Sample-specific sequences can be accessed as replaced by detected sequence variations. Conclusions: SnpHub can be applied to any species, and we build up a SnpHub portal website for wheat and its progenitors based on published data in recent studies.

Mathieson, I	Human adaptation over the past 40,000 years	CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT		Over the past few years several methodological and data-driven advances have greatly improved our ability to robustly detect genomic signatures of selection in humans. New methods applied to large samples of present-day genomes provide increased power, while ancient DNA allows precise estimation of timing and tempo. However, despite these advances, we are still limited in our ability to translate these signatures into understanding about which traits were actually under selection, and why. Combining information from different populations and timescales may allow interpretation of selective sweeps. Other modes of selection have proved more difficult to detect. In particular, despite strong evidence of the polygenicity of most human traits, evidence for polygenic selection is weak, and its importance in recent human evolution remains unclear. Balancing selection and archaic introgression seem important for the maintenance of potentially adaptive immune diversity, but perhaps less so for other traits.

Setter, D; Mousset, S; Cheng, XH; Nielsen, R; DeGiorgio, M; Hermisson, J	VolcanoFinder: Genomic scans for adaptive introgression	PLOS GENETICS		Author summary The process by which beneficial alleles are introduced into a species from a closely-related species is termed adaptive introgression. We present an analytically-tractable model for the effects of adaptive introgression on non-adaptive genetic variation in the genomic region surrounding the beneficial allele. The result we describe is a characteristic volcano-shaped pattern of increased variability that arises around the positively-selected site, and we introduce an open-source methodVolcanoFinderto detect this signal in genomic data. Importantly,VolcanoFinderis a population-genetic likelihood-based approach, rather than a comparative-genomic approach, and can therefore probe genomic variation data from a single population for footprints of adaptive introgression, even froma prioriunknown and possibly extinct donor species. Recent research shows that introgression between closely-related species is an important source of adaptive alleles for a wide range of taxa. Typically, detection of adaptive introgression from genomic data relies on comparative analyses that require sequence data from both the recipient and the donor species. However, in many cases, the donor is unknown or the data is not currently available. Here, we introduce a genome-scan method-VolcanoFinder-to detect recent events of adaptive introgression using polymorphism data from the recipient species only.VolcanoFinderdetects adaptive introgression sweeps from the pattern of excess intermediate-frequency polymorphism they produce in the flanking region of the genome, a pattern which appears as a volcano-shape in pairwise genetic diversity. Using coalescent theory, we derive analytical predictions for these patterns. Based on these results, we develop a composite-likelihood test to detect signatures of adaptive introgression relative to the genomic background. Simulation results show thatVolcanoFinderhas high statistical power to detect these signatures, even for older sweeps and for soft sweeps initiated by multiple migrant haplotypes. Finally, we implementVolcanoFinderto detect archaic introgression in European and sub-Saharan African human populations, and uncovered interesting candidates in both populations, such asTSHRin Europeans andTCHH-RPTNin Africans. We discuss their biological implications and provide guidelines for identifying and circumventing artifactual signals during empirical applications ofVolcanoFinder.

Senturk, N; Ergoren, MC	Developing an Online Portal for Determining the Genomic Signature of Archaic DNA that are Associated to Modern Human Genetic Diseases: A Meta-Analysis Study	EURASIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE	Archaic DNA; single nucleotide polymorphism; toll-like receptor	Objective: Mutations or introgression can cause and rise adaptive alleles of which some can be beneficial. Archaic humans lived more than 200,000 years ago in Europe and Western Asia. They were adapted to the environment and pathogens that prevailed in these locations. It can therefore be thought that modern humans obtained significant immune advantage from the archaic alleles. Materials and Methods: First, data were collected by meta-analysis from previously identified genetic diseases caused by alleles that were introgressed from archaics. Second, the in silico model portal (http://www.archaics2phenotype.xxx.edu.tr) was designed to trace the history of the Neanderthal allele. The portal also shows the current distribution of the genotypes of the selected alleles within different populations and correlates with the individuals phenotype. Results: Our developed model provides a better understanding for the origin of genetic diseases or traits that are associated with the Neanderthal genome. Conclusion: The developed medicine model will help individuals and their populations to receive the best treatment. It also clarifies why there are differences in disease phenotypes in modern humans.

Rees, JS; Castellano, S; Andres, AM	The Genomics of Human Local Adaptation	TRENDS IN GENETICS		Modern humans inhabit a variety of environments and are exposed to a plethora of selective pressures, leading to multiple genetic adaptations to local environmental conditions. These include adaptations to climate, UV exposure, disease, diet, altitude, or cultural practice and have generated important genetic and phenotypic differences amongst populations. In recent years, new methods to identify the genomic signatures of natural selection underlying these adaptations, combined with novel types of genetic data (e.g., ancient DNA), have provided unprecedented insights into the origin of adaptive alleles and the modes of adaptation. As a result, numerous instances of local adaptation have been identified in humans. Here, we review the most exciting recent developments and discuss, in our view, the future of this field.

For instance, they form mosaic hybrid zones or hybrid swarms in areas of secondary contact and hence are suited to address questions related to the evolution of reproductive barriers, adaptive hybridization or speciation. While existing genomic information mostly focuses on single species (ME, MG), this project generated RNA seq data of all three species from allopatric populations, i.e. samples representing genetically pure specimens. We investigated adult mantle tissue (four specimens per species), which is functionally involved in processes such as reproduction or biomineralization. The project provides three assembled transcriptomes (post filtering total transcript numbers for ME: 353339, MT: 437827, MG: 290267) representing genes annotated to at least 40 level 2 GO-terms (number (percentage) of annotated transcripts for ME: 44434 (12.6%), MT: 43960 (10%), MG: 60064 (20.7%)). Annotation showed that the most abundant 40 GO-terms are equally well covered by contigs of the three Mytilus transcriptomes. Therefore, this project lays a basis for evolutionary research by providing candidate genes representing various molecular functions such as reproduction, cellular processes or immune response. The potential of the new transcriptomes to address evolutionary questions is further exemplified by a pilot study on ME and MT transcriptomes that used reciprocal blast to identify 7652 one-to-one orthologue pairs of transcripts.

Ashokkumar, K; Govindaraj, M; Karthikeyan, A; Shobhana, VG; Warkentin, TD	Genomics-Integrated Breeding for Carotenoids and Folates in Staple Cereal Grains to Reduce Malnutrition	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS	biofortification; nutri-genomics; cereal; folate; provitamin A; lutein; zeaxanthin; human nutrition	Globally, two billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. Cereal grains provide more than 50% of the daily requirement of calories in human diets, but they often fail to provide adequate essential minerals and vitamins. Cereal crop production in developing countries achieved remarkable yield gains through the efforts of the Green Revolution (117% in rice, 30% in wheat, 530% in maize, and 188% in pearl millet). However, modern varieties are often deficient in essential micronutrients compared to traditional varieties and land races. Breeding for nutritional quality in staple cereals is a challenging task; however, biofortification initiatives combined with genomic tools increase the feasibility. Current biofortification breeding activities include improving rice (for zinc), wheat (for zinc), maize (for provitamin A), and pearl millet (for iron and zinc). Biofortification is a sustainable approach to enrich staple cereals with provitamin A, carotenoids, and folates. Significant genetic variation has been found for provitamin A (96-850 mu g and 12-1780 mu g in 100 g in wheat and maize, respectively), carotenoids (558-6730 mu g in maize), and folates in rice (11-51 mu g) and wheat (32.3-89.1 mu g) in 100 g. This indicates the prospects for biofortification breeding. Several QTLs associated with carotenoids and folates have been identified in major cereals, and the most promising of these are presented here. Breeding for essential nutrition should be a core objective of next-generation crop breeding. This review synthesizes the available literature on folates, provitamin A, and carotenoids in rice, wheat, maize, and pearl millet, including genetic variation, trait discovery, QTL identification, gene introgressions, and the strategy of genomics-assisted biofortification for these traits. Recent evidence shows that genomics-assisted breeding for grain nutrition in rice, wheat, maize, and pearl millet crops have good potential to aid in the alleviation of micronutrient malnutrition in many developing countries.

Kumari, P; Singh, KP; Bisht, D; Kumar, S	Somatic hybrids of Sinapis alba plus Brassica juncea: study of backcross progenies for morphological variations, chromosome constitution and reaction to Alternaria brassicae	EUPHYTICA	Sinapis alba; Genomic in situ hybridization; Alien introgression lines; Genetic variations; Ploidy augmentation; Alternaria blight	The wild relatives of crops represent a rich reservoir of genes for introducing resilience to climate change into cultivated crops. To introgress genes from Sinapis alba, a wild relative of Brassicaceae, into Brassica juncea, a cultivated member of this family, we initially produced somatic hybrids between the two species and then produced a large number of backcross populations involving the two somatic hybrids (H1 and H2) with Brassica juncea. BC1 progeny were morphologically very similar. However, when they were challenge inoculated with a highly virulent Alternaria brassicae (ITCC No. 2542) culture under in vivo and in vitro conditions in two growing seasons, they showed wide variations in their disease reaction. Of the 40 BC1 lines tested in one season, 36 showed a resistant reaction. BC1F2 progenies derived from these resistant BC1 plants also showed resistance to Alternaria brassicae, indicating stable inheritance of the resistant phenotype. However, BC1F2 progenies showed a wide variation in morphological traits, including plant height, basal branching, leaf thickness, trichome density on leaves and stem. BC1 plants were examined by genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH) to determine their chromosome constitution. All five plants were found to possess 12 strong hybridization signals upon hybridization with a FITC-labeled S. alba-specific probe. GISH studies on BC1F2 plants indicated localized signals in addition to 12 full chromosome hybridization signals, suggesting alien introgressions into B. juncea that requires further validation. The BC2 generation was found to possess half of the haploid set of alien chromosomes. The BC1F2 and BC2 generations were further screened against A. Brassiceae and found to be resistant/tolerant.

Esteller-Cucala, P; Maceda, I; Borglum, AD; Demontis, D; Faraone, SV; Cormand, B; Lao, O	Genomic analysis of the natural history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder using Neanderthal and ancient Homo sapiens samples	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS		Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an impairing neurodevelopmental condition highly prevalent in current populations. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this paradox, mainly in the context of the Paleolithic versus Neolithic cultural shift but especially within the framework of the mismatch theory. This theory elaborates on how a particular trait once favoured in an ancient environment might become maladaptive upon environmental changes. However, given the lack of genomic data available for ADHD, these theories have not been empirically tested. We took advantage of the largest GWAS meta-analysis available for this disorder consisting of over 20,000 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 35,000 controls, to assess the evolution of ADHD-associated alleles in European populations using archaic, ancient and modern human samples. We also included Approximate Bayesian computation coupled with deep learning analyses and singleton density scores to detect human adaptation. Our analyses indicate that ADHD-associated alleles are enriched in loss of function intolerant genes, supporting the role of selective pressures in this early-onset phenotype. Furthermore, we observed that the frequency of variants associated with ADHD has steadily decreased since Paleolithic times, particularly in Paleolithic European populations compared to samples from the Neolithic Fertile Crescent. We demonstrate this trend cannot be explained by African admixture nor Neanderthal introgression, since introgressed Neanderthal alleles are enriched in ADHD risk variants. All analyses performed support the presence of long-standing selective pressures acting against ADHD-associated alleles until recent times. Overall, our results are compatible with the mismatch theory for ADHD but suggest a much older time frame for the evolution of ADHD-associated alleles compared to previous hypotheses.

[syn. Ae. markgrafii (Greuter) Hammer], is a diploid wild relative of wheat (2n = 2x = 14, CC) and a valuable source for new genetic diversity for wheat improvement. It has a variety of disease resistance factors along with tolerance for various abiotic stresses and can be used for wheat improvement through the generation of genome-wide introgressions resulting in different wheat-Ae. caudata recombinant lines. Here, we report the generation of nine such wheat-Ae. caudata recombinant lines which were characterized using wheat genome-specific KASP (Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR) markers and multi-color genomic in situ hybridization (mcGISH). Of these, six lines have stable homozygous introgressions from Ae. caudata and will be used for future trait analysis. Using cytological techniques and molecular marker analysis of the recombinant lines, 182 KASP markers were physically mapped onto the seven Ae. caudata chromosomes, of which 155 were polymorphic specifically with only one wheat subgenome. Comparative analysis of the physical positions of these markers in the Ae. caudata and wheat genomes confirmed that the former had chromosomal rearrangements with respect to wheat, as previously reported. These wheat-Ae. caudata recombinant lines and KASP markers are useful resources that can be used in breeding programs worldwide for wheat improvement. Additionally, the genome-specific KASP markers could prove to be a valuable tool for the rapid detection and marker-assisted selection of other Aegilops species in a wheat background.

SNP frequencies vary depending on the species and populations under study, and therefore target SNPs need to be carefully selected to be informative for each application. While multiple SNP genotyping systems are available for rice (Oryza sativa L. and its relatives), they vary in their informativeness, cost, marker density, speed, flexibility, and data quality. In this study, we report the development and performance of the Cornell-IR LD Rice Array (C7AIR), a second-generation SNP array containing 7,098 markers that improves upon the previously released C6AIR. The C7AIR is designed to detect genome-wide polymorphisms within and between subpopulations of O. sativa, as well as O. glaberrima, O. rufipogon and O. nivara. The C7AIR combines top-performing SNPs from several previous rice arrays, including 4,007 SNPs from the C6AIR, 2,056 SNPs from the High Density Rice Array (HDRA), 910 SNPs from the 384-SNP GoldenGate sets, 189 SNPs from the 44K array selected to add information content for elite U.S. tropical japonica rice varieties, and 8 trait-specific SNPs. To demonstrate its utility, we carried out a genome-wide association analysis for plant height, employing the C7AIR across a diversity panel of 189 rice accessions and identified 20 QTLs contributing to plant height. The C7AIR SNP chip has so far been used for genotyping > 10,000 rice samples. It successfully differentiates the five subpopulations of Oryza sativa, identifies introgressions from wild and exotic relatives, and is useful for quantitative trait loci (QTL) and association mapping in diverse materials. Moreover, data from the C7AIR provides valuable information that can be used to select informative and reliable SNP markers for conversion to lower-cost genotyping platforms for genomic selection and other downstream applications in breeding.

The objectives of the study are to identify successful introgression of A. diogoi's genome and to evaluate the spotted wilt resistance in the introgression population. Sixty-three putative introgression lines were genotyped using 137 polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers, out of which 14 markers located on seven of the 20 peanut chromosomes showed introgression of A. diogoi genome into at least one of the introgression lines. In addition, genotyping by sequencing of a subset of the population revealed SNP loci displaying introgression of A. diogoi genome on every chromosome of the A sub-genome of the introgression lines, with the most introgressed loci on chromosome A05. Several introgression lines showed consistent spotted wilt resistance, suggesting successful genomic introgression of A. diogoi contributing to the resistance.

Allier, A; Teyssedre, S; Lehermeier, C; Moreau, L; Charcosset, A	Optimized breeding strategies to harness genetic resources with different performance levels	BMC GENOMICS	Genetic resources; Genetic diversity; Genetic base broadening; Pre-breeding; Genomic prediction; Optimal cross selection	BackgroundThe narrow genetic base of elite germplasm compromises long-term genetic gain and increases the vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses in unpredictable environmental conditions. Therefore, an efficient strategy is required to broaden the genetic base of commercial breeding programs while not compromising short-term variety release. Optimal cross selection aims at identifying the optimal set of crosses that balances the expected genetic value and diversity. We propose to consider genomic selection and optimal cross selection to recurrently improve genetic resources (i.e. pre-breeding), to bridge the improved genetic resources with elites (i.e. bridging), and to manage introductions into the elite breeding population. Optimal cross selection is particularly adapted to jointly identify bridging, introduction and elite crosses to ensure an overall consistency of the genetic base broadening strategy.ResultsWe compared simulated breeding programs introducing donors with different performance levels, directly or indirectly after bridging. We also evaluated the effect of the training set composition on the success of introductions. We observed that with recurrent introductions of improved donors, it is possible to maintain the genetic diversity and increase mid- and long-term performances with only limited penalty at short-term. Considering a bridging step yielded significantly higher mid- and long-term genetic gain when introducing low performing donors. The results also suggested to consider marker effects estimated with a broad training population including donor by elite and elite by elite progeny to identify bridging, introduction and elite crosses.ConclusionResults of this study provide guidelines on how to harness polygenic variation present in genetic resources to broaden elite germplasm.

They all localize to chromosome 1B but were thought to be non-allelic based on differences in resistance response. We recently cloned Yr15 as a Wheat Tandem Kinase 1 (WTK1) and show here that these three resistance loci co-segregate in fine-mapping populations and share an identical full-length genomic sequence of functional Wtk1. Independent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized susceptible yrG303 and yrH52 lines carried single nucleotide mutations in Wtk1 that disrupted function. A comparison of the mutations for yr15, yrG303, and yrH52 mutants showed that while key conserved residues were intact, other conserved regions in critical kinase subdomains were frequently affected. Thus, we concluded that Yr15-, YrG303-, and YrH52-mediated resistances to yellow rust are encoded by a single locus, Wtk1. Introgression of Wtk1 into multiple genetic backgrounds resulted in variable phenotypic responses, confirming that Wtk1-mediated resistance is part of a complex immune response network. WEW natural populations subjected to natural selection and adaptation have potential to serve as a good source for evolutionary studies of different traits and multifaceted gene networks.

In this study, a set of 90 back cross lines at BC2F8 generation derived from Swarna x Oryza nivara IRGC81832 was evaluated for yield traits under irrigated conditions in wet seasons of 3 consecutive years. We identified a set of 70 chromosome segment substitution lines, using genotyping data from 140 SSR markers covering 94.4% of O. nivara genome. Among these, 23 CSSLs were significantly different for 7 traits. 22 QTLs were detected for 11 traits with 6.51 to 46.77% phenotypic variation in 90 BILs. Three pleiotropic genomic regions associated with yield traits were mapped on chromosomes 1, 8 and 11. The marker interval RM206-RM144 at chromosome 11 was recurrently detected for various yield traits. Ten QTLs were identified consistently in the three consecutive years of testing. Seventeen pairs of significant epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) were detected for days to flowering, days to maturity and plant height. Chromosome segments from O. nivara contributed trait enhancing alleles. The significantly improved lines and the stable QTLs identified in this study are valuable resource for gene discovery and yield improvement.

Orteu, A; Jiggins, CD	The genomics of coloration provides insights into adaptive evolution	NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS		Colour traits have been useful for studying the genetics underlying adaptive evolution. This Review discusses how genomic technologies are providing a deeper understanding of these traits, revealing fresh insights into their genetic architecture, evolvability and origins of adaptive variation. Coloration is an easily quantifiable visual trait that has proven to be a highly tractable system for genetic analysis and for studying adaptive evolution. The application of genomic approaches to evolutionary studies of coloration is providing new insight into the genetic architectures underlying colour traits, including the importance of large-effect mutations and supergenes, the role of development in shaping genetic variation and the origins of adaptive variation, which often involves adaptive introgression. Improved knowledge of the genetic basis of traits can facilitate field studies of natural selection and sexual selection, making it possible for strong selection and its influence on the genome to be demonstrated in wild populations.

Kallamadi, PR; Mulpuri, S	Inheritance and molecular mapping of powdery mildew (Golovinomyces orontii) resistance gene(s) in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)	3 BIOTECH	G; orontii; Powdery mildew; Quantitative trait loci; Sunflower	Sources of resistance to powdery mildew incited by Golovinomyces orontii have been identified in wild sunflowers and few exotic lines. The present investigation has been undertaken to study the inheritance of powdery mildew resistance and to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing resistance to powdery mildew in a multiple disease resistance line, TX16R (PI 642072). The inheritance was observed as a continuous distribution in a set of 264 F-2 population and 93 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of a cross between a highly susceptible accession PS 2023 and TX16R. Screening of the two population sets was done with 484 sunflower-specific SSR primers of which 175 primers showed polymorphism between the parents. Based on the phenotyping and genotyping data, the linkage map was constructed with 93 RILs. The map spanned 1200 cM and included 64 markers distributed along the 17 sunflower chromosomes in the haploid set. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified three genomic regions for resistance to powdery mildew, two of which mapped on chromosome 10 and one on chromosome 5. This is the first report on mapping of powdery mildew resistance in sunflower and paves the way in fine mapping and introgression of resistance for powdery mildew in sunflower through marker-assisted breeding.	3 BIOTECH		10.1007/s13205-020-02224-2	  			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Inheritance studies in a recombinant inbred line population of wheat-Ae. peregrina introgression line IL pau16061 revealed the transfer of a single major dominant gene conditioning all stage resistance, herein temporarily designated as LrAp. Genomic in situ hybridisation of IL pau16061, resistant and susceptible RILs with U- and S-genome DNA probes confirmed that the introgression with leaf rust resistance is from the U-p genome of Ae. peregrina. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation using chromosome specific probes identified U-p genome introgression to be on the long arm of wheat chromosome 6B. To genetically map LrAp, bulked segregant analysis was combined with resistance gene enrichment sequencing (MapRenSeq). Five nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat contigs distinguished resistant and susceptible bulks and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from these contigs co-segregated with LrAp. All five RenSeq NB_ARC contigs showed identity with the long arm of wheat chromosome 6B confirming the introgression on 6BL which we propose is a compensating translocation from Ae. peregrina chromosome 6U(p)L due to homoeology between the alien and wheat chromosomes. The SNP markers developed in this study will aid in cloning and marker assisted gene pyramiding of LrAp.	SCI REP-UK		10.1038/s41598-020-64166-2	  			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

We have performed a detailed screen of the leaf epidermis in two generations of the well-established Solanum lycopersicum cv M82 x Solanum pennellii ac. LA716 introgression line (IL) population using a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Quantification of trichome and stomatal densities in the ILs revealed four genomic regions with a consistently low trichome density. This study also found ILs with abnormal proportions of different trichome types and aberrant trichome morphologies. This work has led to the identification of new, unexplored genomic regions with roles in trichome formation in tomato. This study investigated one interval in IL2-6 in more detail and identified a new function for the transcription factor SlMixta-like in determining trichome patterning in leaves. This illustrates how these SEM images, publicly available to the research community, provide an important dataset for further studies on epidermal development in tomato and other species of the Solanaceae family.

Bryant, KN; Newton, ILG	The Intracellular Symbiont Wolbachia pipientis Enhances Recombination in a Dose-Dependent Manner	INSECTS	Wolbachia; recombination; Drosophila	Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular alphaproteobacterium that infects 40%-60% of insect species and is well known for host reproductive manipulations. Although Wolbachia are primarily maternally transmitted, evidence of horizontal transmission can be found in incongruent host-symbiont phylogenies and recent acquisitions of the same Wolbachia strain by distantly related species. Parasitoids and predator-prey interactions may indeed facilitate the transfer of Wolbachia between insect lineages, but it is likely that Wolbachia are acquired via introgression in many cases. Many hypotheses exist to explain Wolbachia prevalence and penetrance, such as nutritional supplementation, protection from parasites, protection from viruses, or direct reproductive parasitism. Using classical genetics, we show that Wolbachia increase recombination in infected lineages across two genomic intervals. This increase in recombination is titer-dependent as the wMelPop variant, which infects at higher load in Drosophila melanogaster, increases recombination 5% more than the wMel variant. In addition, we also show that Spiroplasma poulsonii, another bacterial intracellular symbiont of D. melanogaster, does not induce an increase in recombination. Our results suggest that Wolbachia infection specifically alters its host's recombination landscape in a dose-dependent manner.

Natri, HM; Bobowik, KS; Kusuma, P; Darusallam, CC; Jacobs, GS; Hudjashov, G; Lansing, JS; Sudoyo, H; Banovich, NE; Cox, MP; Romero, IG	Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns reflect genetic ancestry and environmental differences across the Indonesian archipelago	PLOS GENETICS		Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, host to striking levels of human diversity, regional patterns of admixture, and varying degrees of introgression from both Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it has been largely excluded from the human genomics sequencing boom of the last decade. To serve as a benchmark dataset of molecular phenotypes across the region, we generated genome-wide CpG methylation and gene expression measurements in over 100 individuals from three locations that capture the major genomic and geographical axes of diversity across the Indonesian archipelago. Investigating between- and within-island differences, we find up to 10.55% of tested genes are differentially expressed between the islands of Sumba and New Guinea. Variation in gene expression is closely associated with DNA methylation, with expression levels of 9.80% of genes correlating with nearby promoter CpG methylation, and many of these genes being differentially expressed between islands. Genes identified in our differential expression and methylation analyses are enriched in pathways involved in immunity, highlighting Indonesia's tropical role as a source of infectious disease diversity and the strong selective pressures these diseases have exerted on humans. Finally, we identify robust within-island variation in DNA methylation and gene expression, likely driven by fine-scale environmental differences across sampling sites. Together, these results strongly suggest complex relationships between DNA methylation, transcription, archaic hominin introgression and immunity, all jointly shaped by the environment. This has implications for the application of genomic medicine, both in critically understudied Indonesia and globally, and will allow a better understanding of the interacting roles of genomic and environmental factors shaping molecular and complex phenotypes. Author summary Understanding how gene expression varies across individuals and environments is fundamental for the success of molecular medicine. However, the vast majority of studies of gene expression, particularly in healthy individuals, have primarily involved populations of European descent. It is unclear whether these findings are generalizable to the rest of humanity. We examined gene expression and DNA methylation in 116 individuals across Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country. Our three populations-Mentawai off the western coast of Sumatra, Sumba in central Indonesia, and a group of hunter-gatherers, the Korowai, living in the province of West Papua in New Guinea-span the main axes of genetic and geographic diversity in the region. Up to 10% of genes show differences in expression and methylation patterns between islands, with many involved in immune function. Variation between villages within each location can likely be attributed to small-scale environmental differences. These findings emphasise the need to consider a broad range of genetic and environmental backgrounds when examining how molecular patterns and processes are shared across human populations.

Segregation analysis indicated BPH resistance of RBPH660 was controlled by multiple genes/QTLs. By using the bulked segregant analysis (BSA)-seq method, two genomic regions harboring QTLs resistance to BPH were identified from 1.20 to 16.70 Mb on chromosome 4 and from 10.20 to 12.60 Mb on chromosome 9 in RBPH660, respectively. A major resistance locus, designated as Bph35 accounting for 51.27% of the phenotypic variation with a LOD score of 42.51, was mapped to the candidate region of chromosome 4 between InDel (insertion-deletion) markers PSM16 and R4M13. For fine mapping of Bph35, one simple sequence repeat and three newly developed InDel markers were used to screen the recombinants. Finally, the Bph35 locus was delimited in the region from 6.28 to 6.93 Mb and there were 18 predicted protein-encoding genes with a total of 114 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant sites between the resistant and susceptible parents. Out of these genes, Os04g0193950, encoding a putative NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, R proteins and CED-4) and LRR (leucine-rich repeat) domain protein with nine non-synonymous SNP substitutions in its coding sequence regions, might be the candidate gene for Bph35. These findings would facilitate the map-based cloning of the Bph35 gene and development of resistant varieties against BPH in rice.

Gagnaire, PA	Comparative genomics approach to evolutionary process connectivity	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	comparative population genomics; conservation and management; demographic history; genetic connectivity; life history traits; whole-genome resequencing	The influence of species life history traits and historical demography on contemporary connectivity is still poorly understood. However, these factors partly determine the evolutionary responses of species to anthropogenic landscape alterations. Genetic connectivity and its evolutionary outcomes depend on a variety of spatially dependent evolutionary processes, such as population structure, local adaptation, genetic admixture, and speciation. Over the last years, population genomic studies have been interrogating these processes with increasing resolution, revealing a large diversity of species responses to spatially structured landscapes. In parallel, multispecies meta-analyses usually based on low-genome coverage data have provided fundamental insights into the ecological determinants of genetic connectivity, such as the influence of key life history traits on population structure. However, comparative studies still lack a thorough integration of macro- and micro-evolutionary scales to fully realize their potential. Here, I present how a comparative genomics framework may provide a deeper understanding of evolutionary process connectivity. This framework relies on coupling the inference of long-term demographic and selective history with an assessment of the contemporary consequences of genetic connectivity. Standardizing this approach across several species occupying the same landscape should help understand how spatial environmental heterogeneity has shaped the diversity of historical and contemporary connectivity patterns in different taxa with contrasted life history traits. I will argue that a reasonable amount of genome sequence data can be sufficient to resolve and connect complex macro- and micro-evolutionary histories. Ultimately, implementing this framework in varied taxonomic groups is expected to improve scientific guidelines for conservation and management policies.

Mao, YF; Hou, SQ; Shi, JF; Economo, EP	TREEasy: An automated workflow to infer gene trees, species trees, and phylogenetic networks from multilocus data	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	gene trees; introgression; phylogenetic inference; phylogenetic network; pipeline; workflow; species tree	Multilocus genomic data sets can be used to infer a rich set of information about the evolutionary history of a lineage, including gene trees, species trees, and phylogenetic networks. However, user-friendly tools to run such integrated analyses are lacking, and workflows often require tedious reformatting and handling time to shepherd data through a series of individual programs. Here, we present a tool written in Python-TREEasy-that performs automated sequence alignment (with MAFFT), gene tree inference (with IQ-Tree), species inference from concatenated data (with IQ-Tree and RaxML-NG), species tree inference from gene trees (with ASTRAL, MP-EST, and STELLS2), and phylogenetic network inference (with SNaQ and PhyloNet). The tool only requires FASTA files and nine parameters as inputs. The tool can be run as command line or through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). As examples, we reproduced a recent analysis of staghorn coral evolution, and performed a new analysis on the evolution of the WGD clade of yeast. The latter revealed novel patterns that were not identified by previous analyses. TREEasy represents a reliable and simple tool to accelerate research in systematic biology ().

Wildlife management strives to make use of these vast resources to enable refined genetic assessments that enhance biodiversity conservation. However, as new genomic platforms emerge, problems remain in adapting the usually complex approaches for genotyping of noninvasively collected wildlife samples. Here, we provide practical guidelines for the standardized development of reduced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels applicable for microfluidic genotyping of degraded DNA samples, such as faeces or hairs. We demonstrate how microfluidic SNP panels can be optimized to efficiently monitor European wildcat (Felis silvestris S.) populations. We show how panels can be set up in a modular fashion to accommodate informative markers for relevant population genetics questions, such as individual identification, hybridization assessment and the detection of population structure. We discuss various aspects regarding the implementation of reduced SNP panels and provide a framework that will allow both molecular ecologists and practitioners to help bridge the gap between genomics and applied wildlife conservation.

Scopece, G; Palma-Silva, C; Cafasso, D; Lexer, C; Cozzolino, S	Phenotypic expression of floral traits in hybrid zones provides insights into their genetic architecture	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	additivity; dominance; epistatic interactions; line cross experiments; natural hybridization; orchids	Information on the genetic architecture of phenotypic traits is helpful for constructing and testing models of the ecoevolutionary dynamics of natural populations. For plant groups with long life cycles there is a lack of line cross experiments that can unravel the genetic architecture of loci underlying quantitative traits. To fill this gap, we propose the use of variation for phenotypic traits expressed in natural hybrid zones as an alternative approach. We used data from orchid hybrid zones and compared expected and observed patterns of phenotypic trait expression in different early-generation hybrid classes identified by molecular genetic markers. We found evidence of additivity, dominance, and epistatic interactions for different phenotypic traits. We discuss the potential of this approach along with its limitations and suggest that it may represent a realistic way to gain an initial insight into the heritability and genomic architecture of traits in organismal groups with complex life history, such as orchids and many others.

Gonzalo, MJ; Li, YC; Chen, KY; Gil, D; Montoro, T; Najera, I; Baixauli, C; Granell, A; Monforte, AJ	Genetic Control of Reproductive Traits in Tomatoes Under High Temperature	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	pollen viability; fruit set; QTL; introgression line; tipburn; abiotic stress	Global climate change is increasing the range of temperatures that crop plants must face during their life cycle, giving negative effects to yields. In this changing scenario, understanding the genetic control of plant responses to a range of increasing temperature conditions is a prerequisite to developing cultivars with increased resilience. The current work reports the identification of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) involved in reproductive traits affected by temperature, such as the flower number (FLN) and fruit number (FRN) per truss and percentage of fruit set (FRS), stigma exsertion (SE), pollen viability (PV) and the incidence of the physiological disorder tipburn (TB). These traits were investigated in 168 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RIL) and 52 Introgression Lines (IL) derived from the cross between Solanum lycopersicum var. MoneyMaker and S. pimpinellifolium accession . Mapping populations were cultivated under increased temperature regimen conditions: T1 (25 degrees C day/21 degrees C night), T2 (30 degrees C day/25 degrees C night) and T3 (35 degrees C day/30 degrees C night). The increase in temperature drastically affected several reproductive traits, for example, FRS in Moneymaker was reduced between 75 and 87% at T2 and T3 when compared to T1, while several RILs showed a reduction of less than 50%. QTL analysis allowed the identification of genomic regions affecting these traits at different temperatures regimens. A total of 22 QTLs involved in reproductive traits at different temperatures were identified by multi-environmental QTL analysis and eight involved in pollen viability traits. Most QTLs were temperature specific, except QTLs on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12. Moreover, a QTL located in chromosome 7 was identified for low incidence of TP in the RIL population, which was confirmed in ILs with introgressions on chromosome 7. Furthermore, ILs with introgressions in chromosomes 1 and 12 had good FRN and FRS in T3 in replicated trials. These results represent a catalog of QTLs and pre-breeding materials that could be used as the starting point for deciphering the genetic control of the genetic response of reproductive traits at different temperatures and paving the road for developing new cultivars adapted to climate change.

Species within the genus Thinopyrum have been shown to carry genetic variation for a very wide range of traits including biotic and abiotic stresses and quality. Research has shown that one of the species within this genus, Th. elongatum, has a close relationship with the genomes of wheat making it a highly suitable candidate to expand the gene pool of wheat. Homoeologous recombination, in the absence of the Ph1 gene, has been exploited to transfer an estimated 134 introgressions from Th. elongatum into a hexaploid wheat background. The introgressions were detected and characterised using 263 single nucleotide polymorphism markers from a 35 K Axiom(R) Wheat-Relative Genotyping Array, spread across seven linkage groups and validated using genomic in situ hybridisation. The genetic map had a total length of 187.8 cM and the average chromosome length was 26.8 cM. Comparative analyses of the genetic map of Th. elongatum and the physical map of hexaploid wheat confirmed previous work that indicated good synteny at the macro-level, although Th. elongatum does not contain the 4A/5A/7B translocation found in wheat.

Polyploidy is an evolutionary innovation for many animals and all flowering plants, but its impact on selection and domestication remains elusive. Here we analyze genome evolution and diversification for all five allopolyploid cotton species, including economically important Upland and Pima cottons. Although these polyploid genomes are conserved in gene content and synteny, they have diversified by subgenomic transposon exchanges that equilibrate genome size, evolutionary rate heterogeneities and positive selection between homoeologs within and among lineages. These differential evolutionary trajectories are accompanied by gene-family diversification and homoeolog expression divergence among polyploid lineages. Selection and domestication drive parallel gene expression similarities in fibers of two cultivated cottons, involving coexpression networks and N-6-methyladenosine RNA modifications. Furthermore, polyploidy induces recombination suppression, which correlates with altered epigenetic landscapes and can be overcome by wild introgression. These genomic insights will empower efforts to manipulate genetic recombination and modify epigenetic landscapes and target genes for crop improvement.

Ottenburghs, J	Digest: Avian genomes are permeable to introgression for a few million years	EVOLUTION		How wide is the time window for introgression after divergence? Pulido-Santacruz et al. addressed this question by studying the evolutionary history of the bird genus Dendrocincla. They found five introgression events that occurred between a few hundred thousand and around 2.5 million years after divergence. The introgressed genomic proportion declined exponentially with the age of the hybridizing taxa. Hence, this study suggests that species boundaries are permeable up to 2.5 million years after divergence.	EVOLUTION		10.1111/evo.13968	  			TRUE	TRUE	digest	FALSE			FALSE
Khahani, B; Tavakol, E; Shariati, V; Fornara, F	Genome wide screening and comparative genome analysis for Meta-QTLs, ortho-MQTLs and candidate genes controlling yield and yield-related traits in rice	BMC GENOMICS	Breeding; MQTLs; Synteny analysis; yield-components	Background Improving yield and yield-related traits is the crucial goal in breeding programmes of cereals. Meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis discovers the most stable QTLs regardless of populations genetic background and field trial conditions and effectively narrows down the confidence interval (CI) for identification of candidate genes (CG) and markers development. Results A comprehensive MQTL analysis was implemented on 1052 QTLs reported for yield (YLD), grain weight (GW), heading date (HD), plant height (PH) and tiller number (TN) in 122 rice populations evaluated under normal condition from 1996 to 2019. Consequently, these QTLs were confined into 114 MQTLs and the average CI was reduced up to 3.5 folds in compare to the mean CI of the original QTLs with an average of 4.85 cM CI in the resulted MQTLs. Among them, 27 MQTLs with at least five initial QTLs from independent studies were considered as the most stable QTLs over different field trials and genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, several known and novel CGs were detected in the high confident MQTLs intervals. The genomic distribution of MQTLs indicated the highest density at subtelomeric chromosomal regions. Using the advantage of synteny and comparative genomics analysis, 11 and 15 ortho-MQTLs were identified at co-linear regions between rice with barley and maize, respectively. In addition, comparing resulted MQTLs with GWAS studies led to identification of eighteen common significant chromosomal regions controlling the evaluated traits. Conclusion This comprehensive analysis defines a genome wide landscape on the most stable loci associated with reliable genetic markers and CGs for yield and yield-related traits in rice. Our findings showed that some of these information are transferable to other cereals that lead to improvement of their breeding programs.

Mangino, G; Plazas, M; Vilanova, S; Prohens, J; Gramazio, P	Performance of a Set of Eggplant (Solanum melongena) Lines With Introgressions From Its Wild Relative S. incanum Under Open Field and Screenhouse Conditions and Detection of QTLs	AGRONOMY-BASEL	Solanum melongena; S. incanum; introgression lines; stable QTL analysis; agronomic traits; G x E interaction; synteny	Introgression lines (ILs) of eggplant (Solanum melongena) represent a resource of high value for breeding and the genetic analysis of important traits. We have conducted a phenotypic evaluation in two environments (open field and screenhouse) of 16 ILs from the first set of eggplant ILs developed so far. Each of the ILs carries a single marker-defined chromosomal segment from the wild eggplant relative S. incanum (accession MM577) in the genetic background of S. melongena (accession AN-S-26). Seventeen agronomic traits were scored to test the performance of ILs compared to the recurrent parent and of identifying QTLs for the investigated traits. Significant morphological differences were found between parents, and the hybrid was heterotic for vigour-related traits. Despite the presence of large introgressed fragments from a wild exotic parent, individual ILs did not display differences with respect to the recipient parent for most traits, although significant genotype x environment interaction (G x E) was detected for most traits. Heritability values for the agronomic traits were generally low to moderate. A total of ten stable QTLs scattered across seven chromosomes was detected. For five QTLs, the S. incanum introgression was associated with higher mean values for plant- and flower-related traits, including vigour prickliness and stigma length. For one flower- and four fruit-related-trait QTLs, including flower peduncle and fruit pedicel lengths and fruit weight, the S. incanum introgression was associated with lower mean values for fruit-related traits. Evidence of synteny to other previously reported in eggplant populations was found for three of the fruit-related QTLs. The other seven stable QTLs are new, demonstrating that eggplant ILs are of great interest for eggplant breeding under different environments.

Cross	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Ditelosomic addition line; FISH; GISH; Intergeneric hybridization; Meiosis; Substitution lines; Translocation	The chromosomal constitution of 9 dwarf (D) and 8 semidwarf (SD) lines derived by crossing hexaploid Triticale line NA-75 (AABBRR, 2n = 6x = 42) with Triticumaestivum (AABBDD, 2n = 6x = 42) cv. Chinese Spring was investigated using molecular cytogenetic techniques: fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization. A wheat-rye translocation (T4DS.7RL), 8 substitution lines, and a ditelosomic addition line (7RSdt) were identified. In the substitution lines, 1, 2, or 4 pairs of wheat chromosomes, belonging to the A, B, or D genome, were replaced by rye chromosomes. Substitutions between chromosomes belonging to different wheat genomes [5B(5A), 1D(1B)] also occurred. The lines were genetically stable, each carrying 42 chromosomes, except the wheat-rye ditelosomic addition line, which carried 21 pairs of wheat chromosomes and 1 pair of rye telocentric chromosomes (7RS). The chromosome pairing behavior of the lines was studied during metaphase I of meiosis. The chromosome pairing level and the number of ring bivalents were different for each line. Besides rod bivalents, univalent and multivalent associations (tri- and quadrivalents) were also detected. The main goal of the experiment was to develop genetically stable wheat/Triticale recombinant lines carrying chromosomes/chromatin fragments originating from the R genome of Triticale line NA-75. Introgression of rye genes into hexaploid wheat can broaden its genetic diversity, and the newly developed lines can be used in wheat breeding programs.

Kumar, S; Hilario, E; Deng, CCH; Molloy, C	Turbocharging introgression breeding of perennial fruit crops: a case study on apple	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH		The allelic diversity of primitive germplasm of fruit crops provides a useful resource for introgressing novel genes to meet consumer preferences and environmental challenges. Pre-breeding facilitates the identification of novel genetic variation in the primitive germplasm and expedite its utilisation in cultivar breeding programmes. Several generations of pre-breeding could be required to minimise linkage drag from the donor parent and to maximise the genomic content of the recipient parent. In this study we investigated the potential of genomic selection (GS) as a tool for rapid background selection of parents for the successive generation. A diverse set of 274 accessions was genotyped using random-tag genotyping-by-sequencing, and phenotyped for eight fruit quality traits. The relationship between 'own phenotypes' of 274 accessions and their general combining ability (GCA) was also examined. Trait heritability influenced the strength of correspondence between own phenotype and the GCA. The average (across eight traits) accuracy of predicting own phenotype was 0.70, and the correlations between genomic-predicted own phenotype and GCA were similar to the observed correlations. Our results suggest that genome-assisted parental selection (GAPS) is a credible alternative to phenotypic parental selection, so could help reduce the generation interval to allow faster accumulation of favourable alleles from donor and recipient parents.

Flouri, T; Jiao, XY; Rannala, B; Yang, ZH	A Bayesian Implementation of the Multispecies Coalescent Model with Introgression for Phylogenomic Analysis	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Bayesian inference; BPP; introgression; multispecies coalescent with introgression; MSci; MCMC	Recent analyses suggest that cross-species gene flow or introgression is common in nature, especially during species divergences. Genomic sequence data can be used to infer introgression events and to estimate the timing and intensity of introgression, providing an important means to advance our understanding of the role of gene flow in speciation. Here, we implement the multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression model, an extension of the multispecies-coalescent model to incorporate introgression, in our Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo program BPP. The multispecies-coalescent-withintrogression model accommodates deep coalescence (or incomplete lineage sorting) and introgression and provides a natural framework for inference using genomic sequence data. Computer simulation confirms the good statistical properties of the method, although hundreds or thousands of loci are typically needed to estimate introgression probabilities reliably. Reanalysis of data sets from the purple cone spruce confirms the hypothesis of homoploid hybrid speciation. We estimated the introgression probability using the genomic sequence data from six mosquito species in the Anopheles gambiae species complex, which varies considerably across the genome, likely driven by differential selection against introgressed alleles.

Li, JB; Dundas, I; Dong, CM; Li, GR; Trethowan, R; Yang, ZJ; Hoxha, S; Zhang, P	Identification and characterization of a new stripe rust resistance gene Yr83 on rye chromosome 6R in wheat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Key message A physical map of Secale cereale chromosome 6R was constructed using deletion mapping, and a new stripe rust resistance gene Yr83 was mapped to the deletion bin of FL 0.73-1.00 of 6RL. Rye (Secale cereale L., RR) possesses valuable genes for wheat improvement. In the current study, we report a resistance gene conferring stripe rust resistance effective from seedling to adult plant stages located on chromosome 6R. This chromosome was derived from triticale line T-701 and also carries highly effective resistance to the cereal cyst nematode species Heterodera avenae Woll. A wheat-rye 6R(6D) disomic substitution line exhibited high levels of seedling resistance to Australian pathotypes of the stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) pathogen and showed an even greater resistance to the Chinese Pst pathotypes in the field. Ten chromosome 6R deletion lines and five wheat-rye 6R translocation lines were developed earlier in the attempt to transfer the nematode resistance gene to wheat and used herein to map the stripe rust resistance gene. These lines were subsequently characterized by sequential multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mc-FISH), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), mc-GISH, PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG), and chromosome 6R-specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-Seq) marker analyses to physically map the stripe rust resistance gene. The new stripe rust resistance locus was located in a chromosomal bin with fraction length (FL) 0.73-1.00 on 6RL and was named Yr83. A wheat-rye translocation line T6RL (#5) carrying the stripe rust resistance gene will be useful as a new germplasm in breeding for resistance.

In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in providing the adaptation of upland rice to aerobic environments, we previously developed introgression lines (ILs) with the irrigated rice variety Minghui63 (MH63) as the recipient parent and the upland rice variety Luyin46 (LY46) as the donor parent for subsequent identification of the relevant genes. In this study, IL-U135 was analyzed in detail because of its adaptation to aerobic conditions. Transcriptome profiling revealed 20 and 8 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IL-U135 and MH63 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. In contrast, 306 and 188 DEGs were identified between LY46 and MH63 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the adaptation of upland rice to aerobic environments is intimately associated with CLV3/ESR-related (CLE) signal transduction pathways, CLAVATA1 kinase activity, and salicylic acid related metabolism biosynthetic pathways. The IL-U135, LY46 and MH63 genomes were resequenced to map the genes responsible for adaptations to aerobic conditions. One the basis of an integrated analysis of the transcriptomic and genomic profiles, we propose that genes encoding an NBS-LRR protein (LOC_Os11g10570) and an ATP-binding protein (LOC_Os11g31480) may contribute to the adaptation of upland rice to aerobic environments. Our results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the adaptation of rice to aerobic conditions.

Despite their importance, a lack of genomic information and resources has hindered the functional characterisation of genes in major crops. The recent release of high-quality reference sequences for these crops underpins a suite of genetic and genomic resources that support basic research and breeding. For wheat, these include gene model annotations, expression atlases and gene networks that provide information about putative function. Sequenced mutant populations, improved transformation protocols and structured natural populations provide rapid methods to study gene function directly. We highlight a case study exemplifying how to integrate these resources. This review provides a helpful guide for plant scientists, especially those expanding into crop research, to capitalise on the discoveries made in Arabidopsis and other plants. This will accelerate the improvement of crops of vital importance for food and nutrition security.	ELIFE		10.7554/elife.55646	  			TRUE	TRUE	review paper	FALSE			FALSE

Six wheat-J genome recombinants were identified with ND-FISH and GISH. Diploid wheatgrass, Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14, (EEb)-E-b or J(b)J(b) or JJ), is a well-known alien source of salinity tolerance and disease resistance for wheat improvement. The true genetic potential and effect of such introgressions into wheat can be best studied in chromosomal addition or substitution lines. Here, we report the generation and characterization of various categories of Th. bessarabicum derivatives in both hexaploid and tetraploid cultivated wheats. Sequential non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) are robust techniques to visualize the size of alien introgressions and breakpoints. We identified a complete set of monosomic addition lines into both bread wheat and durum wheat, except for 7J in durum wheat, by sequential ND-FISH and GISH. We also characterized alien derivatives belonging to various classes including mono-telosomic additions, disomic additions, monosomic substitutions, double monosomic substitutions, monosomic substitution-monosomic additions, double monosomic additions, and multiple monosomic additions into both bread and durum wheats. In addition, various wheat-Th. bessarabicum recombinant chromosomes were also detected in six alien derivatives. These wheat-Th. bessarabicum derivatives will provide useful cytogenetic resources for improvement of both hexaploid and tetraploid wheats.

Bruce, RW; Torkamaneh, D; Grainger, CM; Belzile, F; Eskandari, M; Rajcan, I	Haplotype diversity underlying quantitative traits in Canadian soybean breeding germplasm	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Key message Identification of marker-trait associations and trait-associated haplotypes in breeding germplasm identifies regions under selection and highlights changes in haplotype diversity over decades of soybean improvement in Canada. Understanding marker-trait associations using genome-wide association in soybean is typically carried out in diverse germplasm groups where identified loci are often not applicable to soybean breeding efforts. To address this challenge, this study focuses on defining marker-trait associations in breeding germplasm and studying the underlying haplotypes in these regions to assess genetic change through decades of selection. Phenotype data were generated for 175 accessions across multiple environments in Ontario, Canada. A set of 76,549 SNPs were used in the association analysis. A total of 23 genomic regions were identified as significantly associated with yield (5), days to maturity (5), seed oil (3), seed protein (5) and 100-seed weight (5), of which 14 are novel. Each significant region was haplotyped to assess haplotype diversity of the underlying genomic region, identifying ten regions with trait-associated haplotypes in the breeding germplasm. The range of genomic length for these regions (7.2 kb to 6.8 Mb) indicates variation in regional LD for the trait-associated regions. Six of these regions showed changes between eras of breeding, from historical to modern and experimental soybean accessions. Continued selection on these regions may necessitate introgression of novel parental genetic diversity as some haplotypes were fixed within the breeding germplasm. This finding highlights the importance of studying associations and haplotype diversity at a breeding program scale to understand breeders' selections and trends in soybean improvement over time. The haplotypes may also be used as a tool for selection of parental germplasm to inform breeder's decisions on further soybean improvement.

In this study, a collection of 789 bread wheat landraces, held in-trust at the genebank of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) were scanned for seed morphometric traits using GrainScan. Diversity analysis using the 12k DartSeq SNP markers revealed that these accessions can be grouped into five distinct clusters. To evaluate the performance for early selection from genebank accessions, we examined the accuracy of genomic selection models with genomic relationship that these landraces accounted for. Based on cross-validations, prediction accuracies for seed traits ranged from 0.64 for seed perimeter to 0.74 for seed width. The variability of prediction accuracies across random validations averaged at 0.14, with a range from 0.12 to 0.18, suggesting stable predictability and reproducible results even with a collection of much greater genetic diversity from genebank accessions. Adding the climatic relationship matrix between accessions based on passport information improved the predictive ability by 8%. Our results on seed traits demonstrated the capacity for estimating important agronomic phenotypes for genebank accessions directly based on genomic information, further advocating the advance in genomic technologies for identifying parental germplasm as potential donors of beneficial alleles for introgression.

Blennow, A; Skryhan, K; Tanackovic, V; Krunic, SL; Shaik, SS; Andersen, MS; Kirk, HG; Nielsen, KL	Non-GMO potato lines, synthesizing increased amylose and resistant starch, are mainly deficient in isoamylase debranching enzyme	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL	starch; Solanum tuberosum; Solanum sandemanii; introgression; genome sequencing; transcript analysis; polysaccharides; bioengineering; non-GM crops	Solanum tuberosumpotato lines with high amylose content were generated by crossing with the wild potato speciesSolanum sandemanii followed by repeated backcrossing to Solanum tuberosum lines.The trait, termed increased amylose (IAm), was recessive and present after three generations of backcrossing intoS. tuberosumlines (6.25%S. sandemaniigenes). The tubers of these lines were small, elongated and irregular with small and misshaped starch granules and high sugar content. Additional backcrossing resulted in less irregular tuber morphology, increased starch content (4.3%-9.5%) and increased amylose content (29%-37.9%) but indifferent sugar content. The amylose in the IAm starch granules was mainly located in peripheral spots, and large cavities were found in the granules. Starch pasting was suppressed, and the digestion-resistant starch (RS) content was increased. Comprehensive microarray polymer profiling (CoMPP) analysis revealed specific alterations of major pectic and glycoprotein cell wall components. This complex phenotype led us to search for candidate IAm genes exploiting its recessive trait. Hence, we sequenced genomic DNA of a pool of IAm lines, identified SNPs genome wide against the draft genome sequence of potato and searched for regions of decreased heterozygosity. Three regions, located on chromosomes 3, 7 and 10, respectively, displayed markedly less heterozygosity than average. The only credible starch metabolism-related gene found in these regions encoded the isoamylase-type debranching enzyme Stisa1. Decreased expression of mRNA (>500 fold) and reduced enzyme activity (virtually absent from IAm lines) supportedStisa1as a candidate gene for IAm.

Stover, E; Gmitter, FG; Grosser, J; Baldwin, E; Wu, GA; Bai, JH; Wang, Y; Chaires, P; Motamayor, JC	Rationale for reconsidering current regulations restricting use of hybrids in orange juice	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH		Huanglongbing (HLB) is a disease that has devastated the Florida citrus industry, threatens the entire U.S. citrus industry, and globally is rapidly spreading. Florida's citrus production is 90% sweet orange, which is quite sensitive to HLB. The heavy reliance on sweet orange for Florida citrus production makes the industry especially vulnerable to diseases that are damaging to this type of citrus. Furthermore, 90% of Florida oranges are used in producing orange juice that is defined by a federal regulation known as the orange juice standard, specifying that at least 90% of orange juice must be derived from Citrus sinensis. Genomic analyses definitively reveal that sweet orange is not a true species, but just one of many introgression hybrids of C. reticulata and C. maxima, with phenotypic diversity resulting from accumulated mutations in this single hybrid, the sweet orange. No other fruit industry is limited by law to such a narrow genetic base. Fortunately, there are new citrus hybrids displaying reduced sensitivity to HLB, and in some cases they produce juice, alone or in blends, that consumers would recognize as orange juice. Reconsidering current regulations on orange juice standards may permit use of such hybrids in orange juice, providing greater latitude for commercialization of these hybrids, leading to higher-quality orange juice and a more sustainable Florida orange juice industry.

Accessing a crop's secondary gene pool, as represented by its wild relatives, has the potential to greatly expand the supply of usable genetic variation. The crop in which this approach has been most strongly championed is bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), a species which is particularly tolerant of the introduction of chromosomal segments of exotic origin thanks to the genetic buffering afforded by its polyploid status. While the process of introgression can be in itself cumbersome, a larger problem is that linkage drag and/or imperfect complementation frequently impose a yield and/or quality penalty, which explains the reluctance of breeders to introduce such materials into their breeding populations. Thanks to the development of novel strategies to induce introgression and of genomic tools to facilitate the selection of desirable genotypes, introgression breeding is returning as a mainstream activity, at least in wheat. Accessing variation present in progenitor species has even been able to drive genetic advance in grain yield. The current resurgence of interest in introgression breeding can be expected to result in an increased deployment of exotic genes in commercial wheat cultivars.

Mane, R; Katoch, M; Singh, M; Sharma, R; Sharma, TR; Chahota, RK	Identification of genomic regions associated with early plant vigour in lentil (Lens culinaris)	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	lentil; quantitative-trait loci; molecular map; early plant vigour; Lens culinaris	Lentil is one of the most important food legume species, however its genetic and genomic resources remained largely uncharacterized and unexploited. In the past few years, a number of genetic maps have been constructed and marker resources have been developed in lentil. These resources could be exploited for understanding the extent and distribution of genetic variation in genus Lens and also for developing saturated and consensus genetic maps suitable for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection. The present study aims to enrich polymerase chain reaction-based linkage map of F-10 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population of 94 individuals derived from cross WA8649090 x Precoz and identification of QTLs linked to early plant vigour traits. Of the 268 polymorphic markers (93 simple sequence repeats (SSR), three inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) and 172 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs)), 265 (90 SSRs, three ISSRs and 172 RAPDs) were mapped on seven linkage groups, varying in length between 25.6 and 210.3 cM, coverage of 809.4 cM with an average marker spacing of 3.05 cM. The study also reported assigning of 24 new cross-genera SSRs of Trifolium pratense on the present linkage map. The RILs along with the parents were screened for shoot length, root length, seedling length, dry weight, number of leaves and number of branches based on two replications under polyhouse conditions. A QTL-hotspot consisting of six QTLs for shoot length (cm), root length (cm) and seedling length (cm) was observed between a map distances of 56.61 and 86.81 cM on LG1.

Many previous studies were performed to integrate the desirable characters from wild species into modern sugarcane cultivars. Until now, the lack of fertility in hybrids is still a thorny problem in most cases. In our present study, a rare hybrid between E. rockii (2n = 30) and N. porphyrocoma (2n = 30) had been developed for the first time. The molecular primers MSSCIR66, SMC720BS and SMC597CS were successfully applied to identify the putative F-1 hybrids. Besides, the chromosome composition and transmission have also been reported to screen the true F-1 hybrids via genomic in situ hybridization. From the breeding point of view, the implications of gene introgression from N. porphyrocoma and E. rockii are discussed.

Wild species of wheat, such as Thinopyrum intermedium, are an excellent gene source for wheat improvement. In this study, two stripe rust-resistant wheat-Th. intermedium chromosome translocation lines, CH4131 and CH4132, were characterized by cytogenetic and pathological methods. The introgressed chromosome fragment was tagged using amplified fragment-length polymorphism-derived sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers and intron targeting markers, indicating that CH4131 and CH4132 both possess a homologous group 3 chromatin of Th. intermedium. Genomic in situ hybridization results suggested that a very small Th. intermedium chromosome segment was translocated to the terminal region of wheat 1BS for both lines, forming a configuration of T3Ai-1BS.1BL. The two translocation lines were resistant to stripe rust, and the resistance gene, temporarily designated YrCH-1BS, was likely derived from Th. intermedium. The translocated chromosome fragments have no genetic linkage drag to agronomic performance. The grain quality indexes of these two translocations were higher than local wheat varieties. Therefore, CH4131 and CH4132 could be used as potential gene sources in wheat improvement programs. The SCAR markers are useful to select stripe rust resistance from Th. intermedium.

These have been narrowed down to a few preferred DNA based marker types, and emphasis is now on adapting the technologies to a wide range of crop plants and trees. In this Special Issue, the strength of molecular breeding is revealed through research and review papers that use a combination of molecular markers with other classic breeding techniques to obtain quality improvement of the crop. The constant improvement and maintenance of quality by breeding is crucial and challenged by a changing climate and molecular markers can support the direct introgression of traits into elite breeding lines. All the papers in this Special Issue Molecular genetics, Genomics, and Biotechnology in Crop Plant Breeding have attracted significant attention, as can be witnessed by the graphs for each paper on the Journal's homepage. It is the hope that it will encourage others to use these tools in developing an even wider range of crop plants and trees.

However, the genetic and developmental bases of variation in insect eye size is poorly understood, which limits our understanding of how these important morphological differences evolve. To address this, we further explored natural variation in eye size within and between four species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. We found extensive variation in eye size among these species, and flies with larger eyes generally had a shorter inter-ocular distance and vice versa. We then carried out quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of intra-specific variation in eye size and inter-ocular distance in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans. This revealed that different genomic regions underlie variation in eye size and inter-ocular distance in both species, which we corroborated by introgression mapping in D. simulans. This suggests that although there is a trade-off between eye size and inter-ocular distance, variation in these two traits is likely to be caused by different genes and so can be genetically decoupled. Finally, although we detected QTL for intra-specific variation in eye size at similar positions in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we observed differences in eye fate commitment between strains of these two species. This indicates that different developmental mechanisms and therefore, most likely, different genes contribute to eye size variation in these species. Taken together with the results of previous studies, our findings suggest that the gene regulatory network that specifies eye size has evolved at multiple genetic nodes to give rise to natural variation in this trait within and among species.

L; Crops; Genome sequence; Microsatellites; Molecular markers; Peanut breeding program; Peanut; Polymorphic microsatellite; Polymorphism; SSR	Background: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaeo. L) represents one of the most important oil crops in the world. Although much effort has been expended to characterize microsatellites or Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) in peanut, the quantity and quality of the markers in breeding applications remain limited. Here, genome-wide SSR characterization and marker development were performed using the recently assembled genome of the cultivar Tifrunner. Results: In total, 512,900 microsatellites were identified from 2556.9-Mb genomic sequences. Based on the flanking sequences of the identified microsatellites, 7757 primer pairs (markers) were designed, and further evaluated in the assembled genomic sequences of the tetraploid Arachis cultivars, Tifrunner and Shitouqi, and the diploid ancestral species, A. duranensis and A. ipaensis. silica PCR analysis showed that the SSR markers had high amplification efficiency and polymorphism in four Arachis genotypes. Notably, nearly 60% of these markers were single-locus SSRs in tetraploid Arachis species, indicating they are more specific in distinguishing the alleles of the A and B sub-genomes of peanut. In addition, two markers closely related with purple testa color and 27 markers near to FAD2 genes were identified, which could be used for breeding varieties with purple testa and high-oleic acid content, respectively. Moreover, the potential application of these SSR markers in tracking introgressions from Arachis wild relatives was discussed. Conclusions: This study reported the development of genomic SSRs from assembled genomic sequences of the tetraploid Arachis Tifrunner, which will be useful for diversity analysis, genetic mapping and functional genomics studies in peanut.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	aflatoxin; allergens; Arachis hypogaea; crop improvement; groundnut; oleic acid; science of delivery	Groundnut is an important global food and oil crop that underpins agriculture-dependent livelihood strategies meeting food, nutrition, and income security. Aflatoxins, pose a major challenge to increased competitiveness of groundnut limiting access to lucrative markets and affecting populations that consume it. Other drivers of low competitiveness include allergens and limited shelf life occasioned by low oleic acid profile in the oil. Thus grain off-takers such as consumers, domestic, and export markets as well as processors need solutions to increase profitability of the grain. There are some technological solutions to these challenges and this review paper highlights advances in crop improvement to enhance groundnut grain quality and nutrient profile for food, nutrition, and economic benefits. Significant advances have been made in setting the stage for marker-assisted allele pyramiding for different aflatoxin resistance mechanisms-in vitro seed colonization, pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination, and aflatoxin production-which, together with pre- and post-harvest management practices, will go a long way in mitigating the aflatoxin menace. A breakthrough in aflatoxin control is in sight with overexpression of antifungal plant defensins, and through host-induced gene silencing in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway. Similarly, genomic and biochemical approaches to allergen control are in good progress, with the identification of homologs of the allergen encoding genes and development of monoclonal antibody based ELISA protocol to screen for and quantify major allergens. Double mutation of the allotetraploid homeologous genes, FAD2A and FAD2B, has shown potential for achieving >75% oleic acid as demonstrated among introgression lines. Significant advances have been made in seed systems research to bridge the gap between trait discovery, deployment, and delivery through innovative partnerships and action learning.

Desta, ZA; de Koning, DJ; Ortiz, R	Molecular mapping and identification of quantitative trait loci for domestication traits in the field cress (Lepidium campestre L.) genome	HEREDITY		Lepidium campestre (L.) or field cress is a multifaceted oilseed plant, which is not yet domesticated. Moreover, the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the domestication traits of field cress remain largely elusive. The overarching goal of this study is to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are fundamental for domestication of field cress. Mapping and dissecting quantitative trait variation may provide important insights into genomic trajectories underlying field cress domestication. We used 7624 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for QTL mapping in 428 F-2 interspecific hybrid individuals, while field phenotyping was conducted in F-2:3 segregating families. We applied multiple QTL mapping algorithms to detect and estimate the QTL effects for seven important domestication traits of field cress. Verification of pod shattering across sites revealed that the non-shattering lines declined drastically whereas the shattering lines increased sharply, possibly due to inbreeding followed by selection events. In total, 1461 of the 7624 SNP loci were mapped to eight linkage groups (LGs), spanning 571.9 cM map length. We identified 27 QTL across all LGs of field cress genome, which captured medium to high heritability, implying that genomics-assisted selection could deliver domesticated lines in field cress breeding. The use of high throughput genotyping can accelerate the process of domestication in novel crop species. This is the first QTL mapping analysis in the field cress genome that may lay a foundational framework for positional or functional QTL cloning, introgression as well as genomics-assisted breeding in field cress domestication.

To comprehensively understand their genetic diversity and divergence for future genetic improvement requires high-density markers. Here, we sequenced 93 accessions encompassing these three Coffea species, uncovering 15,367,960 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs are unequally distributed across different genomic regions and gene families, with two disease-resistant gene families showing the highest SNP density, suggesting strong balancing selection. Meanwhile, the allotetraploid C. arabica exhibits greater nucleotide diversity, followed by C. canephora and C. excelsa. Population divergence (F-ST), population stratification and phylogeny all support strong divergence among species, with C. arabica and its parental species C. canephora being closer genetically. Scanning of genomic islands with elevated F-ST and structure-disruptive SNPs contributing to species divergence revealed that most of the selected genes in each lineage are independent, with a few being selected in parallel for two or three species, such as genes in root hair cell development, flavonols accumulation and disease-resistant genes. Moreover, some of the SNPs associated with coffee lipids exhibit significantly biased allele frequency among species, being valuable for interspecific breeding. Overall, our study not only uncovers the key population genomic patterns among species but also contributes a substantial genomic resource for coffee breeding.

A blue mold resistance locus, qM-Pe3.1, was previously identified on chromosome 3 of Malus sieversii PI 613981, a wild accession with inferior fruit quality. Introgression of the resistance allele into elite breeding germplasm is difficult and success of introgression and the effect of the PI 613981 genome on fruit quality cannot be phenotypically evaluated until fruiting, which occurs approximately 5 years from seed. In this study, introgression of the qM-Pe3.1 resistance allele was achieved by rapid cycle breeding, utilizing the transgenic line T1190 constitutively expressing the BpMADS4 early-flowering gene. This was supported by DNA-based diagnostic information that enabled marker-assisted selection for blue mold resistance using a locus-specific DNA test developed to detect the qM-Pe3.1 resistance allele in offspring (foreground selection). Of 75 second-generation (['Gala' x PI 613981] x T1190) offspring carrying BpMADS4, 43 also carried the qM-Pe3.1 resistance allele. DNA tests for other trait loci were used to identify other desirable alleles related to fruit quality in progeny and 6874 genome-wide SNP markers (from an apple 20K Illumina (R) SNP array) were used to identify undesirable genomic segments of PI 613981 (background selection). Three individuals identified with favorable recombination close to qM-Pe3.1 and less than 25% of M. sieversii unimproved genome were selected as best suited for the elimination of unimproved DNA segments in subsequent generations. Our pipeline for introgression of qM-Pe3.1, facilitated by marker-assisted foreground and background selection, successfully advanced this promising germplasm in readiness for the next generation.

The present paper reports on an investigation of three species of couch grasses (Elymus hispidus, E. repens, and E. caninus) examining the ploidy levels and absolute genome sizes (1081 plants from 302 natural populations in Central Europe, verified by chromosome counts) and their morphological delimitation. In the present study, the hexaploid level prevailed in E. hispidus and E. repens whereas E. caninus was exclusively tetraploid. Introgressive hybridization between hexaploid species, unidirectionally shifted towards E. hispidus, was indicated by a continual pattern of genome size values. We did not find any evidence for heteroploid hybridization involving tetraploid E. caninus; however, we detected minority cytotypes among both E. caninus plants (hexaploid) and E. repens-E. hispidus hybrids (heptaploid and nonaploid) suggesting the formation of unreduced gametes. Morphometric results (367 plants, redundancy analysis, principal component analysis, and correlation analysis) mirrored the continual homoploid pattern of absolute genome size (including the unidirectional shift), and a significant correlation between absolute genome size and morphology was confirmed. Moreover, morphometric analyses detected additional characteristics for the delimitation of the Elymus taxa under study. Considering the crossability of E. hispidus with Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), the revealed extent of introgressive hybridization has implications for assessing the potential risk of gene flow between crops and troublesome weeds.

Hence, the deployment of combinations of adult plant resistance (APR) and ASR genes in new wheat cultivars is desirable. Adult plant resistance gene Lr49 was previously mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4B of cultivar VL404 and flanked by microsatellite markers barc163 (8.1 cM) and wmc349 (10.1 cM), neither of which was sufficiently closely linked for efficient marker assisted selection. This study used high-density SNP genotyping and flow sorted chromosome sequencing to fine-map the Lr49 locus as a starting point to develop a diagnostic marker for use in breeding and to clone this gene. Marker sunKASP_21 was mapped 0.4 cM proximal to Lr49, whereas a group of markers including sunKASP_24 were placed 0.6 cM distal to this gene. Testing of the linked markers on 75 Australian and 90 European cultivars with diverse genetic backgrounds showed that sunKASP_21 was most strongly associated with Lr49. Our results also show that the Lr49 genomic region contains structural variation relative to the reference stock Chinese Spring, possibly an inverted genomic duplication, which introduces a new set of challenges for the Lr49 cloning.

Mini Core Collection	AGRONOMY-BASEL	DArTseq; groundnut; linkage disequilibrium; marker-assisted selection; marker-trait association; physiological traits	In order to integrate genomics in breeding and development of drought-tolerant groundnut genotypes, identification of genomic regions/genetic markers for drought surrogate traits is essential. We used 3249 diversity array technology sequencing (DArTSeq) markers for a genetic analysis of 125 ICRISAT groundnut mini core collection evaluated in 2015 and 2017 for genome-wide marker-trait association for some physiological traits and to determine the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Marker-trait association (MTA) analysis, probability values, and percent variation modelled by the markers were calculated using the GAPIT package via the KDCompute interface. The LD analysis showed that about 36% of loci pairs were in significant LD (p < 0.05 and r(2) > 0.2) and 3.14% of the pairs were in complete LD. The MTAs studies revealed 20 significant MTAs (p < 0.001) with 11 markers. Four MTAs were identified for leaf area index, 13 for canopy temperature, one for chlorophyll content and two for normalized difference vegetation index. The markers explained 20.8% to 6.6% of the phenotypic variation observed. Most of the MTAs identified on the A subgenome were also identified on the respective homeologous chromosome on the B subgenome. This could be due to a common ancestor of the A and B genome which explains the linkage detected between markers lying on different chromosomes. The markers identified in this study can serve as useful genomic resources to initiate marker-assisted selection and trait introgression of groundnut for drought tolerance after further validation.

However, whether pollen from a different genus affects the genomic stability and/or transcriptome of the recipient species during intergeneric pollination has not been investigated. Here, we crossed japonica rice cv. Z12 with the maize accession B73 (pollen donor) and obtained a morphologically stable line, MU1, exhibiting moderate dwarfism, higher tiller number, and increased grain weight compared with Z12. To reveal the genetic basis of these morphological changes in MU1, we performed whole-genome resequencing of MU1 and Z12. Compared with Z12, MU1 showed 107,250 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 23,278 insertion/deletions (InDels). Additionally, 5'-upstream regulatory regions (5'UTRs) of 429 and 309 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MU1 contained SNPs and InDels, respectively, suggesting that a subset of these DEGs account for the variation in 5'UTRs. Transcriptome analysis revealed 2190 DEGs in MU1 compared with Z12. Genes up-regulated in MU1 were mainly involved in photosynthesis, generation of precursor metabolites, and energy and cellular biosynthetic processes; whereas those down-regulated in MU1 were involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathway and response to stimuli and stress processes. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) further identified the expression levels of the up- or down-regulated gene in plant hormone signal transduction pathway. The expression level changes of plant hormone signal transduction pathway may be significant for plant growth and development. These findings suggest that mutations caused by intergeneric pollination could be the important reason for changes of MU1 in agronomic traits.

Ollier, M; Talle, V; Brisset, AL; Le Bihan, Z; Duerr, S; Lemmens, M; Goudemand, E; Robert, O; Hilbert, JL; Buerstmayr, H	QTL mapping and successful introgression of the spring wheat-derived QTL Fhb1 for Fusarium head blight resistance in three European triticale populations	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Triticale; Fusarium head blight; Resistance breeding; WKS; QTL; Marker; GBS; SSR; Fhb1; Ddw1	Key message The spring wheat-derived QTL Fhb1 was successfully introgressed into triticale and resulted in significantly improved FHB resistance in the three triticale mapping populations. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major problem in cereal production particularly because of mycotoxin contaminations. Here we characterized the resistance to FHB in triticale breeding material harboring resistance factors from bread wheat. A highly FHB-resistant experimental line which derives from a triticale x wheat cross was crossed to several modern triticale cultivars. Three populations of recombinant inbred lines were generated and evaluated in field experiments for FHB resistance using spray inoculations during four seasons and were genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing and SSR markers. FHB severity was assessed in the field by visual scorings and on the harvested grain samples using digital picture analysis for quantifying the whitened kernel surface (WKS). Four QTLs with major effects on FHB resistance were identified, mapping to chromosomes 2B, 3B, 5R, and 7A. Those QTLs were detectable with both Fusarium severity traits. Measuring of WKS allows easy and fast grain symptom quantification and appears as an effective scoring tool for FHB resistance. The QTL on 3B collocated with Fhb1, and the QTL on 5R with the dwarfing gene Ddw1. This is the first report demonstrating the successful introgression of Fhb1 into triticale. It comprises a significant step forward for enhancing FHB resistance in this crop.	THEOR APPL GENET		10.1007/s00122-019-03476-0	  			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE
Moest, M; Van Belleghem, SM; James, JE; Salazar, C; Martin, SH; Barker, SL; Moreira, GRP; Merot, C; Joron, M; Nadeau, NJ; Steiner, FM; Jiggins, CD	Selective sweeps on novel and introgressed variation shape mimicry loci in a butterfly adaptive radiation	PLOS BIOLOGY		Natural selection leaves distinct signatures in the genome that can reveal the targets and history of adaptive evolution. By analysing high-coverage genome sequence data from 4 major colour pattern loci sampled from nearly 600 individuals in 53 populations, we show pervasive selection on wing patterns in the Heliconius adaptive radiation. The strongest signatures correspond to loci with the greatest phenotypic effects, consistent with visual selection by predators, and are found in colour patterns with geographically restricted distributions. These recent sweeps are similar between co-mimics and indicate colour pattern turn-over events despite strong stabilising selection. Using simulations, we compare sweep signatures expected under classic hard sweeps with those resulting from adaptive introgression, an important aspect of mimicry evolution in Heliconius butterflies. Simulated recipient populations show a distinct 'volcano' pattern with peaks of increased genetic diversity around the selected target, characteristic of sweeps of introgressed variation and consistent with diversity patterns found in some populations. Our genomic data reveal a surprisingly dynamic history of colour pattern selection and co-evolution in this adaptive radiation.

Xavier, A; Rainey, KM	Quantitative Genomic Dissection of Soybean Yield Components	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	soybean; genomic prediction; GWAS; GxE; yield; yield components; heritability; SoyNAM	Soybean is a crop of major economic importance with low rates of genetic gains for grain yield compared to other field crops. A deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of yield components may enable better ways to tackle the breeding challenges. Key yield components include the total number of pods, nodes and the ratio pods per node. We evaluated the SoyNAM population, containing approximately 5600 lines from 40 biparental families that share a common parent, in 6 environments distributed across 3 years. The study indicates that the yield components under evaluation have low heritability, a reasonable amount of epistatic control, and partially oligogenic architecture: 18 quantitative trait loci were identified across the three yield components using multi-approach signal detection. Genetic correlation between yield and yield components was highly variable from family-to-family, ranging from -0.2 to 0.5. The genotype-by-environment correlation of yield components ranged from -0.1 to 0.4 within families. The number of pods can be utilized for indirect selection of yield. The selection of soybean for enhanced yield components can be successfully performed via genomic prediction, but the challenging data collections necessary to recalibrate models over time makes the introgression of QTL a potentially more feasible breeding strategy. The genomic prediction of yield components was relatively accurate across families, but less accurate predictions were obtained from within family predictions and predicting families not observed included in the calibration set.

Young, AE; Mansour, TA; McNabb, BR; Owen, JR; Trott, JF; Brown, CT; Van Eenennaam, AL	Genomic and phenotypic analyses of six offspring of a genome-edited hornless bull	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY		A genome-edited hornless compound heterozygous dairy bull transmitted this trait to his offspring. Genome editing followed by reproductive cloning was previously used to produce two hornless dairy bulls. We crossed one genome-edited dairy bull, homozygous for the dominant P-C Celtic POLLED allele, with horned cows (pp) and obtained six heterozygous (P(C)p) polled calves. The calves had no horns and were otherwise healthy and phenotypically unremarkable. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of all animals using an Illumina HiSeq4000 to achieve 20x coverage. Bioinformatics analyses revealed the bull was a compound heterozygote, carrying one naturally occurring P-C Celtic POLLED allele and an allele containing an additional introgression of the homology-directed repair donor plasmid along with the P-C Celtic allele. These alleles segregated in the offspring of this bull, and inheritance of either allele produced polled calves. No other unintended genomic alterations were observed. These data can be used to inform conversations in the scientific community, with regulatory authorities and with the public around 'intentional genomic alterations' and future regulatory actions regarding genome-edited animals.

Zhang, MY; Zhang, W; Zhu, XW; Sun, Q; Chao, SM; Yan, CH; Xu, SS; Fiedler, J; Cai, XW	Partitioning and physical mapping of wheat chromosome 3B and its homoeologue 3E in Thinopyrum elongatum by inducing homoeologous recombination	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS		Key message We performed homoeologous recombination-based partitioning and physical mapping of wheat chromosome 3B and Th. elongatum chromosome 3E, providing a unique physical framework of this homoeologous pair for genome studies. The wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) and Thinopyrum elongatum (2n = 2x = 14, EE) genomes can be differentiated from each other by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (FGISH) as well as molecular markers. This has facilitated homoeologous recombination-based partitioning and engineering of their genomes for physical mapping and alien introgression. Here, we constructed a special wheat genotype, which was double monosomic for wheat chromosome 3B and Th. elongatum chromosome 3E and homozygous for the ph1b mutant, to induce 3B-3E homoeologous recombination. Totally, 81 3B-3E recombinants were recovered and detected in the primary, secondary, and tertiary homoeologous recombination cycles by FGISH. Comparing to the primary recombination, the secondary and tertiary recombination shifted toward the proximal regions due to the increase in homology between the pairing partners. The 3B-3E recombinants were genotyped by high-throughput wheat 90-K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and their recombination breakpoints physically mapped based on the FGISH patterns and SNP results. The 3B-3E recombination physically partitioned chromosome 3B into 38 bins, and 429 SNPs were assigned to the distinct bins. Integrative analysis of FGISH and SNP results led to the construction of a composite bin map for chromosome 3B. Additionally, we developed 22 SNP-derived semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR markers specific for chromosome 3E and constructed a comparative map of homoeologous chromosomes 3E, 3B, 3A, and 3D. In summary, this work provides a unique physical framework for further studies of the 3B-3E homoeologous pair and diversifies the wheat genome for wheat improvement.

Luo, FX; Evans, K; Norelli, JL; Zhang, ZW; Peace, C	Prospects for achieving durable disease resistance with elite fruit quality in apple breeding	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	Apple scab; Blue mold; Fire blight; Marker-assisted introgression; Powdery mildew; SNP array	Apple industries suffer from major apple diseases because of widely planted susceptible cultivars. Developed disease-resistant cultivars that often carry only a single source of resistance are not expected to be durable over time. Cultivars with multiple sources of resistance are often commercially unacceptable due to unsatisfactory fruit quality alleles inherited from unimproved and improved parents. To improve fruit quality, approximately five modified backcrossing generations have been used with phenotypic selection for offspring with the least proportion of unimproved genome and elite fruit quality. Modified backcrossing is time-consuming owing to the long juvenility of apple. Unimproved parents are always assumed to carry undesirable alleles in addition to the targeted resistance allele. To efficiently identify favorable offspring each generation, DNA-based markers would be useful. Locus-specific DNA tests are unavailable to detect many sources of resistance alleles. Known numbers of DNA segments from unimproved parents could help subsequent parent selection among offspring because of the direct connection to the probability of eliminating such segments each generation. Accurately estimating the proportion and number of unimproved segments requires precise information on genomic positions of recombinations that can be detected with effective genetic marker sets. High-resolution and genome-wide apple SNP arrays can be used to characterize unimproved DNA segments present in disease-resistant offspring to efficiently achieve durable resistance and elite fruit quality. To hasten apple flowering, a rapid generation cycling approach with transgenic genetic stocks is available. Using these tools is expected to effectively exploit additional unimproved germplasm toward apple genetic improvement.

The large amount of genomic data now available and statistical tools to analyze them provide unprecedented power for phylogenetic inference. Targeted sequencing has emerged as a strong tool for estimating species trees in the face of rapid radiations, lineage sorting, and introgression. Evolutionary relationships in Cyperaceae have been studied mostly using Sanger sequencing until recently. Despite ample taxon sampling, relationships in many genera remain poorly understood, hampered by diversification rates that outpace mutation rates in the loci used. The C4 Cyperus clade of the genus Cyperus has been particularly difficult to resolve. Previous studies based on a limited set of markers resolved relationships among Cyperus species using the C3 photosynthetic pathway, but not among C4 Cyperus clade taxa. We test the ability of two targeted sequencing kits to resolve relationships in the C4 Cyperus clade, the universal Angiosperms-353 kit and a Cyperaceae-specific kit. Sequences of the targeted loci were recovered from data generated with both kits and used to investigate overlap in data between kits and relative efficiency of the general and custom approaches. The power to resolve shallow-level relationships was tested using a summary species tree method and a concatenated maximum likelihood approach. High resolution and support are obtained using both approaches, but high levels of missing data disproportionately impact the latter. Targeted sequencing provides new insights into the evolution of morphology in the C4 Cyperus clade, demonstrating for example that the former segregate genus Alinula is polyphyletic despite its seeming morphological integrity. An unexpected result is that the Cyperus margaritaceus-Cyperus niveus complex comprises a clade separate from and sister to the core C4 Cyperus clade. Our results demonstrate that data generated with a family-specific kit do not necessarily have more power than those obtained with a universal kit, but that data generated with different targeted sequencing kits can often be merged for downstream analyses. Moreover, our study contributes to the growing consensus that targeted sequencing data are a powerful tool in resolving rapid radiations.

Huang, JP; Hill, JG; Ortego, J; Knowles, LL	Paraphyletic species no more - genomic data resolve a Pleistocene radiation and validate morphological species of the Melanoplus scudderi complex (Insecta: Orthoptera)	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY		Rapid speciation events, with taxa generated over a short time period, are among the most investigated biological phenomena. However, molecular systematics often reveals contradictory results compared with morphological/phenotypical diagnoses of species under scenarios of recent and rapid diversification. In this study, we used molecular data from an average of over 29 000 loci per sample from RADseq to reconstruct the diversification history and delimit the species boundary in a short-winged grasshopper species complex (Melanoplus scudderi group), where Pleistocene diversification has been hypothesized to generate more than 20 putative species with distinct male genitalic shapes. We found that, based on a maximum likelihood molecular phylogeny, each morphological species indeed forms a monophyletic group, contrary to the result from a previous mitochondrial DNA sequence study. By dating the diversification events, the species complex is estimated to have diversified during the Late Pleistocene, supporting the recent radiation hypothesis. Furthermore, coalescent-based species delimitation analyses provide quantitative support for independent genetic lineages, which corresponds to the morphologically defined species. Our results also showed that male genitalic shape may not be predicted by evolutionary distance among species, not only indicating that this trait is labile, but also implying that selection may play a role in character divergence. Additionally, our findings suggest that the rapid speciation events in this flightless grasshopper complex might be primarily associated with the fragmentation of their grassland habitats during the Late Pleistocene. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of integrating multiple sources of information to delineate species, especially for a species complex that diversified rapidly, and whose divergence may be linked to ecological processes that create geographic isolation (i.e. fragmented habitats), as well as selection acting on characters with direct consequences for reproductive isolation (i.e. genitalic divergence).

Najeeb, S; Ali, J; Mahender, A; Pang, YL; Zilhas, J; Murugaiyan, V; Vemireddy, LR; Li, Z	Identification of main-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for low-temperature stress tolerance germination- and early seedling vigor-related traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Low-temperature stress; Germination; Early seedling growth stage; Stress index; SNP markers; Quantitative trait loci	An attempt was made in the current study to identify the main-effect and co-localized quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for germination and early seedling growth traits under low-temperature stress (LTS) conditions in rice. The plant material used in this study was an early backcross population of 230 introgression lines (ILs) in BCIF7 generation derived from the Weed Tolerant Rice-1 (WTR-1) (as the recipient) and Haoannong (HNG) (as the donor). Genetic analyses of LTS tolerance revealed a total of 27 main-effect quantitative trait loci (M-QTLs) mapped on 12 chromosomes. These QTLs explained more than 10% of phenotypic variance (PV), and average PV of 12.71% while employing 704 high-quality SNP markers. Of these 27 QTLs distributed on 12 chromosomes, 11 were associated with low-temperature germination (LTG), nine with low-temperature germination stress index (LTGS), five with root length stress index (RLSI), and two with biomass stress index (BMSI) QTLs, shoot length stress index (SLSI) and root length stress index (RLSI), seven with seed vigor index (SVI), and single QTL with root length (RL). Among them, five significant major QTLs (qLTG(I)(1), qLTGS(I)(1-2), qLTG(I)(5), qLTGS(I)(5), and qLTG(I)(7)) mapped on chromosomes 1, 5, and 7 were associated with LTG and LTGS traits and the PV explained ranged from 16 to 23.3%. The genomic regions of these QTLs were co-localized with two to six QTLs. Most of the QTLs were growth stage-specific and found to harbor QTLs governing multiple traits. Eight chromosomes had more than four QTLs and were clustered together and designated as promising LTS tolerance QTLs (qLTTs), as qLTT(1), qLTT(2), qLTT(3), qLTT(5), qLTT(6), qLTT(8), qLTT(9), and qLTT(11). A total of 16 putative candidate genes were identified in the major M-QTLs and co-localized QTL regions distributed on different chromosomes. Overall, these significant genomic regions of M-QTLs are responsible for multiple traits and this suggested that these could serve as the best predictors of LTS tolerance at germination and early seedling growth stages. Furthermore, it is necessary to fine-map these regions and to find functional markers for marker-assisted selection in rice breeding programs for cold tolerance.

Park, BS; Jang, S; Yu, Y; Choi, GJ; Kang, BC; Seo, S	QTL Mapping and molecular markers of Powdery Mildew Resistance in Pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata)	HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY	Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS); introgression; SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism); whole genome re-sequencing	Cucurbita moschata, an economically and nutritionally important vegetable in Korea, is seriously damaged in fruit quality and productivity by powdery mildew fungus (Podosphaera xanthii). To understand genetic bases of the powdery mildew disease resistance, an F2 population was developed from a cross between TG201 (C. moschata, susceptible, female parent) and TG10 (resistant, male parent) heirloom from Hongikbio Inc. Randomly selected 204 F2 individuals were assayed against powdery mildew pathogen, and construction of genetic map and QTL analysis were conducted using SNPs derived from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) method. The single major QTL was located in 6.9 - 7.3 Mb region of TG10 chromosome 3. Within the 400 kb region, we investigated DNA insertion and deletion (indel) variations between TG201 and TG10 genome, and successfully designed seven sets of indel PCR markers. The functional validity of the powdery mildew resistance markers was confirmed with F2 individuals, breeding lines, and commercial varieties. From genomic sequence comparison on the basis of the breeding history, we also could clarify that the powdery mildew resistance region was introduced from C. okeechobeensis subsp. martinezii to C. moschata. Moreover, whole genome assemblies of two heirloom parents and genome-wide SNP/indel information were produced and are expected to be utilized as a genome resource for study of genus Cucurbita. The results and information of this study will be useful for genetics researches and breeding practices of C. moschata.

Substantial evidence indicates that direct genetic interactions or interbreeding between wild and escaped farmed Atlantic salmon occurs, genetically altering wild salmon and reducing population viability. However, genetic interactions may also occur through ecological mechanisms (e.g. disease, parasites, predation, competition), both in conjunction with and in the absence of interbreeding. Here we examine existing evidence for ecological and nonreproductive genetic interactions between domestic Atlantic salmon and wild populations and the potential use of genetic and genomic tools to resolve these impacts. Our review identified examples of genetic changes resulting from ecological processes, predominately through pathogen or parasite transmission. In addition, many examples were identified where aquaculture activities have either altered the selective landscape experienced by wild populations or resulted in reductions in population abundance, both of which are consistent with the widespread occurrence of indirect genetic changes. We further identify opportunities for genetic or genomic methods to quantify these impacts, though careful experimental design and pre-impact comparisons are often needed to accurately attribute genetic change to aquaculture activities. Our review indicates that ecological and non-reproductive genetic interactions are important, and further study is urgently needed to support an integrated understanding of aquaculture-ecosystem interactions, their implications for ecosystem stability, and the development of potential mitigation and management strategies.

Majka, J; Majka, M; Kopecky, D; Dolezel, J	Cytogenetic insights into Festulolium	BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM	chromosome pairing; Festuca spp.; genome balance; genome composition; Lolium spp.	Climate change calls for new methods and plant materials to breed crops adapted to new environmental conditions. Sustainable forage and amenity grass production during periods of severe drought and heat waves during summer, and unequal distribution of precipitation over the year will require drought-tolerant genotypes. However, high-yielding ryegrasses (Lolium spp.), which are the most commonly used grass species, suffer during abiotic stresses. Introgression of drought and heat tolerance from closely related fescues (Festuca spp.) offers an opportunity to develop superior hybrid cultivars to mitigate the negative impact of climate change. Intergeneric cross-hybridization and the development of Festulolium (Festuca x Lolium) hybrids was initiated 100 years ago and resulted in registration of almost one hundred cultivars. For a long time, their genome composition was not known and was debated by breeders and geneticists. In the last three decades, molecular cytogenetic and genomic approaches have enabled their detailed characterization. These studies revealed a gradual replacement of Festuca chromosomes by those of Lolium in consecutive generations leading to an almost complete elimination of Festuca chromatin in the introgression forms. On the other hand, amphiploid cultivars seem to be more stable with the optimal proportions of the Lolium to Festuca genomes at about 2:1. In this mini review, we discuss recent advances in the analysis of the genome composition of Festulolium hybrids with a specific focus on genome (in)stability.

Kamboj, R; Singh, B; Mondal, TK; Bisht, DS	Current status of genomic resources on wild relatives of rice	BREEDING SCIENCE	database; genomics; Oryza; rice; wild rice	Rice is a food crop of global importance, cultivated in diverse agro-climatic zones of the world. However, in the process of domestication many beneficial alleles have been eroded from the gene pool of the rice cultivated globally and eventually has made it vulnerable to a plethora of stresses. In contrast, the wild relatives of rice, despite being agronomically inferior, have inherited a potential of surviving in a range of geographical habitats. These adaptations enrich them with novel traits that upon introgression to modern cultivated varieties offer tremendous potential of increasing yield and adaptability. But, due to the unavailability of their genetic as well as genomic resources, identification and characterisation of these novel beneficial alleles has been a challenging task. Nevertheless, with the unprecedented surge in the area of conservation genomics, researchers have now shifted their focus towards these natural repositories of beneficial traits. Presently, there are several generic and specialized databases harboring genome-wide information on wild species of rice, and are acting as a useful resource for identification of novel genes and alleles, designing of molecular markers, comparative analysis and evolutionary biology studies. In this review, we introduce the key features of these databases focusing on their utility in rice breeding programs.	BREEDING SCI		10.1270/jsbbs.19064	  			TRUE	TRUE	review-like paper	FALSE			FALSE
Zhang, M; Ping, WJ; Fu, QM	Interbreeding between archaic human groups and anatomically modern humans commonly occurring in prehistory	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE	ancient genomic data; prehistoric admixture; Neanderthal; Denisovan	A hominin bone fragment from Denisova Cave (Russia) was identified among very few archaic human specimens (i.e., Neanderthals and Denisovans) as being the first-generation offspring of a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. The ancient genomic study of this individual, together with previous evidence of interbreeding, suggests that admixture between archaic and modern humans was common. Here, we review the evidence for hominin interbreeding and the impact of introgressed archaic human DNA on modern humans. As the recovery of human remains in the Pleistocene is extremely rare, a collagen fingerprinting method, often referred to as Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS), was applied to identify over 2000 fragmented bones from Denisova Cave with one being of hominin origin. This individual, named Denisova 11, had her genome sequenced to an average coverage of 2.6-fold. Her mitochondrial DNA was found to be of the Neanderthal type and direct radiocarbon dating showed her to be more than 50000 years old. Approximately equal proportions of Neanderthal-like and Denisovan-like alleles were found in the Denisova 11 individual. This can be explained by her belonging to a population with mixed Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestry, or by her parents being from each one of these two groups. After excluding any accidental mixing of DNA in the laboratory or systematic errors in data processing, analysis of the individual's alleles carried by two randomly drawn DNA fragments indicated that she had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans outside Africa was confirmed by a series of studies since the draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was published in 2010; non-Africans today are the products of this mixture. The proportion of Neanderthal ancestry is significantly higher in present-day East Asians (2.3%-2.6%) than in Western Eurasians (1.8%-2.4%). This has been explained by two independent Neanderthal gene flow events, a later out-of-Africa migration that diluted the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry in Western Eurasian ancestors, or by purifying selection in different population groups. A recent study found that African populations have more Neanderthal ancestry than previously thought, which can be explained by back-migration of Europeans carrying Neanderthal ancestry into Africa. Another widely-known archaic human group, the Denisovans, was identified by the ancient DNA extracted from a finger bone found in Denisova Cave. Along with the high proportion (similar to 5%) of ancestry contributed to present-day Melanesians in Oceania, Denisovans also contributed similar to 0.2% to the ancestry of mainland Asian and Native American populations. Genes flow into Denisovans from Neanderthals and an unknown hominin ( super-archaic) were also suggested by ancient DNA studies. Archaeological, ancient genomic, and ancient protein studies suggest Denisovans may have had a wide ecological and geographic distribution. Overall, frequent admixture among different human groups resulted in similar to 2% Neanderthal ancestry in all non-African humans and up to 5% Denisovan ancestry in some present-day Oceanians. The introgressed archaic human DNA in present-day humans have been affected by natural selection, and inferences about the functional, evolutionary, and phenotypic significance reveal both positive and negative effects. Functional regions of modern human genomes have fewer archaic alleles than expected under a neutral demographic model, which suggests a reduced fitness of some archaic alleles in modern humans. Many Neanderthal variants associated with phenotypes and susceptibility to diseases have been identified in present-day non-Africans, such as type 2 diabetes, lupus, biliary cirrhosis, etc. However, many of the introgressed tracts are also functionally important and possibly helped modern humans adapt to different environments, such as high altitude and latitude areas. For example, the EPAS1 and WARS2/TBX15, are associated with a high-altitude and high-latitude adaptation in Tibetans and Greenlandic Inuits, respectively. These findings illustrate that admixture with archaic humans has provided genetic variation that helped humans adapt to new environments and has continued to shape our biology. We expect that in the future there will be more evidence of interbreeding between humans in different areas and time periods, adding more details to human genetic history.

Ren, RS; Xu, JH; Zhang, M; Liu, G; Yao, XF; Zhu, LL; Hou, Q	Identification and Molecular Mapping of a Gummy Stem Blight Resistance Gene in Wild Watermelon (Citrullus amarus) Germplasm PI 189225	PLANT DISEASE	gummy stem blight; molecular marker; resistance gene; wild watermelon germplasm	Gummy stem blight (GSB), caused by Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum (syn. Didymella bryoniae), is a destructive foliar disease of watermelon in areas with hot and humid climates. The wild watermelon germplasm PI 189225 is a known source of resistance to GSB. The identification and use of molecular markers linked to resistance genes in the wild-type germplasm will speed up the introgression of GSB resistance into new watermelon varieties. An F-2 segregating population was obtained from a cross between the resistant wild watermelon genotype PI 189225 and the susceptible genotype K3. The F-2-derived F-3 families were inoculated with a single isolate of S. cucurbitacearum (JS002) from Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The results of the genetic analysis demonstrated that GSB resistance in PI 189225 was controlled by a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), temporarily designated Qgsb8.1. Based on the results of bulk sergeant analysis and sequencing, one associated region spanning 5.7 Mb (10,358,659 to 16,101,517) on chromosome 8 was identified as responsible for the resistance to GSB using the Delta(single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]-index) method. The result of a QTL linkage analysis with Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) SNP markers further mapped the GSB resistance locus between the SNP markers KASP_JS9383 and KASP_JS9168 in a region of 571.27 kb on chromosome 8. According to the watermelon gene annotation database, the region contains approximately 19 annotated genes and, of these 19 genes, 2 are disease resistance gene analogs: Cla001017 (coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat resistance protein) and Cla001019 (pathogenesis related). Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR demonstrated that the expression of the two genes changed following S. cucurbitacearum infection, suggesting that they play important roles in GSB resistance in watermelon. This result will facilitate fine mapping and cloning of the Qgsb8.1 locus, and the linked markers will further provide a useful tool for marker-assisted selection of this locus in watermelon breeding programs.

Latifi, M; Rashidi, A; Abdollahi-Arpanahi, R; Razmkabir, M	Comparison of different selection methods for improving litter size in sheep using computer simulation	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH	major gene; synthetic breed; genomic evaluation	Aim of study: To assess selection methods via introgression to improve litter size in native and synthetic sheep breeds. Area of study: Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran. Material and methods: Selection approaches were performed using classical, genomic, gene-assisted classical (GasClassical) and gene-assisted genomic (GasGenomic) selection. Litter size trait with heritability of 0.1 including two chromosomes was simulated. On chromosome 1, a single QTL as the major gene was created to explain 40% of the total additive genetic variance. After simulation of a historical population, the animals from the last historical population were split into two populations. For the next 7 generations, animals were selected for favorable or unfavorable alleles to create distinct breeds of A or B, respectively. Then from the last generation, both males and females from breed B were selected to create a native population. On the other hand, males from breed A and females from breed B were mated to simulate a synthetic population. Finally, intra-population selections were carried out based on high breeding values during the last five generations. Main results: The genetic gain in the synthetic breed was higher than that of the native breed under all selection methods. The frequencies of favorable alleles after five generations in the classical, genomic, GasClassical and GasGenoimc selection approaches in the synthetic breed were 0.623, 0.730, 0.850 and 0.848, respectively. Research highlights: Combining gene-assisted selection with classical or genomic selection has the potential to improve genetic gain and increase the frequencies of favorable allele for litter size in sheep.

Marques, JP; Seixas, FA; Farelo, L; Callahan, CM; Good, JM; Montgomery, WI; Reid, N; Alves, PC; Boursot, P; Melo-Ferreira, J	An Annotated Draft Genome of the Mountain Hare (Lepus timidus)	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	whole-genome sequencing; de novo assembly; annotation; hares; Leporids; Lagomorpha	Hares (genus Lepus) provide clear examples of repeated and often massive introgressive hybridization and striking local adaptations. Genomic studies on this group have so far relied on comparisons to the European rabbit (Otyctolagus cuniculus) reference genome. Here, we report the first de novo draft reference genome for a hare species, the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), and evaluate the efficacy of whole-genome re-sequencing analyses using the new reference versus using the rabbit reference genome. The genome was assembled using the ALLPATHS-LG protocol with a combination of overlapping pair and mate-pair Illumina sequencing (77x coverage). The assembly contained 32,294 scaffolds with a total length of 2.7 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 3.4 Mb. Re-scaffolding based on the rabbit reference reduced the total number of scaffolds to 4,205 with a scaffold N50 of 194 Mb. A correspondence was found between 22 of these hare scaffolds and the rabbit chromosomes, based on gene content and direct alignment. We annotated 24,578 protein coding genes by combining ab-initio predictions, homology search, and transcriptome data, of which 683 were solely derived from hare-specific transcriptome data. The hare reference genome is therefore a new resource to discover and investigate hare-specific variation. Similar estimates of heterozygosity and inferred demographic history profiles were obtained when mapping hare whole-genome re-sequencing data to the new hare draft genome or to alternative references based on the rabbit genome. Our results validate previous reference-based strategies and suggest that the chromosome-scale hare draft genome should enable chromosome-wide analyses and genome scans on hares.

Daskalova, N; Spetsov, P	Taxonomic Relationships and Genetic Variability of Wild Secale L. Species as a Source for Valued Traits in Rye, Wheat and Triticale Breeding	CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS	genus Secale; classification; feral rye; wild rye species; genetic diversity; useful breeding traits	Rye (Secale L.) is a member of family Poaceae (tribe Triticeae) and includes perennial or annual, self-incompatible or self-compatible, and cultivated, weedy or wild species. Classification of the genus Secale is inconsistent, and comprises 3-4 to 8 species from the phylogenetic studies in the last ten years. Progress in rye breeding has been significantly reduced due to involving a small number of cultivars and landraces in crosses. The wild rye species and subspecies possess many valuable breeding traits for research aimed at expanding the variability in Secale cereale subsp. cereale. They are, due to their genetic diversity and high breeding trait expression, useful sources of genes for tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, and triticale improvement, too. One of the species, S. vavilovii, is attractive for rye breeding due to its high self-fertility, resistance to fusarium ear blight, septoria leaf blotch, high protein content, sprouting and sterilising cytoplasm, and genetic similarity with S. cereale subsp. dighoricum. Chromosomes of S. strictum are sources for resistance to yellow rust, Russian wheat aphid, grain hardness, increased protein and arabinoxylan content.

Dong, ZJ; Tian, XB; Ma, C; Xia, Q; Wang, BL; Chen, QF; Sehgal, SK; Friebe, B; Li, HH; Liu, WX	Physical Mapping of Pm57, a Powdery Mildew Resistance Gene Derived from Aegilops searsii	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES	Pm57; physical mapping; RNA-seq; common wheat; molecular markers	Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is one of many severe diseases that threaten bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and quality worldwide. The discovery and deployment of powdery mildew resistance genes (Pm) can prevent this disease epidemic in wheat. In a previous study, we transferred the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm57 from Aegilops searsii into common wheat and cytogenetically mapped the gene in a chromosome region with the fraction length (FL) 0.75-0.87, which represents 12% segment of the long arm of chromosome 2S(s)#1. In this study, we performed RNA-seq using RNA extracted from leaf samples of three infected and mock-infected wheat-Ae. searsii 2S(s)#1 introgression lines at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after inoculation with Bgt isolates. Then we designed 79 molecular markers based on transcriptome sequences and physically mapped them to Ae. searsii chromosome 2S(s)#1- in seven intervals. We used these markers to identify 46 wheat-Ae. searsii 2S(s)#1 recombinants induced by ph1b, a deletion mutant of pairing homologous (Ph) genes. After analyzing the 46 ph1b-induced 2S(s)#1L recombinants in the region where Pm57 is located with different Bgt-responses, we physically mapped Pm57 gene on the long arm of 2S(s)#1 in a 5.13 Mb genomic region, which was flanked by markers X67593 (773.72 Mb) and X62492 (778.85 Mb). By comparative synteny analysis of the corresponding region on chromosome 2B in Chinese Spring (T.aestivum L.) with other model species, we identified ten genes that are putative plant defense-related (R) genes which includes six coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CNL), three nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NL) and a leucine-rich receptor-like repeat (RLP) encoding proteins. This study will lay a foundation for cloning of Pm57, and benefit the understanding of interactions between resistance genes of wheat and powdery mildew pathogens.

We generated replicate admixed populations between two pairs of sister species of Drosophila: D. simulans and D. mauritiana; and D. yakuba and D. santomea. Each pair consisted of a continental species and an island endemic. The admixed populations were maintained by random mating in discrete generations for over 20 generations. We assessed morphological, behavioral, and fitness-related traits from each replicate population periodically, and sequenced genomic DNA from the populations at generation 20. For both pairs of species, species-specific traits and their genomes regressed to those of the continental species. A few alleles from the island species persisted, but they tended to be proportionally rare among all sites in the genome and were rarely fixed within the populations. This paucity of alleles from the island species was particularly pronounced on the X-chromosome. These results indicate that nearly all foreign genes were quickly eliminated after hybridization and that selection against the minor species genome might be similar across experimental replicates.

Nouhaud, P; Blanckaert, A; Bank, C; Kulmuni, J	Understanding Admixture: Haplodiploidy to the Rescue	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION		Hybridization has broad evolutionary consequences, from fueling or counteracting speciation to facilitating adaptation to novel environments. Hybridization and subsequent introgression appear widespread along the tree of life. However, our understanding of how distinct evolutionary forces shape admixed genomes and the fate of introgressed genetic variants remains scarce. Most admixture research in animals has focused on diploid organisms. Wepropose that haplodiploid organisms can help resolve open questions about the genomic consequences of hybridization in natural populations. The ploidy difference between haploid males and diploid females, the availability of genome-wide male haplotypes, and ongoing cases of admixture make haplodiploid organisms promising models to improve our knowledge with regards to the evolution of hybrid genomes.
