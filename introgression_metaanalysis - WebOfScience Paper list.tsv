Runemark, Anna; Trier, Cassandra N.; Eroukhmanoff, Fabrice; Hermansen, Jo S.; Matschiner, Michael; Ravinet, Mark; Elgvin, Tore O.; Saetre, Glenn-Peter	Variation and constraints in hybrid genome formation	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	Hybridization is an important source of variation; it transfers adaptive genetic variation across species boundaries and generates new species. Yet, the limits to viable hybrid genome formation are poorly understood. Here we investigated to what extent hybrid genomes are free to evolve by sequencing the genomes of four island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae. We report that a variety of novel and fully functional hybrid genomic combinations are likely to have arisen independently on Crete, Corsica, Sicily and Malta, with differentiation in candidate genes for beak shape and plumage colour. However, certain genomic regions are invariably inherited from the same parent species, limiting variation. These regions are over-represented on the Z chromosome and harbour candidate incompatibility loci, including DNA-repair and mitonuclear genes. These gene classes may contribute to the general reduction of introgression on sex chromosomes. This study demonstrates that hybrid genomes may vary, and identifies new candidate reproductive isolation genes.	2018	10.1038/s41559-017-0437-7		Birds	Passeriformes	Passer	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	ADMIXTURE, PCA, Fst, Saguaro, Dstats	WGS (49237560 loci)	TRUE	
Carling, Matthew D.; Brumfield, Robb T.	Speciation in Passerina buntings: introgression patterns of sex-linked loci identify a candidate gene region for reproductive isolation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Sex-chromosomes are thought to play an important role in speciation, but few studies of non-model organisms have investigated the relative influence of multiple sex-linked markers on reproductive isolation. We collected 222 individuals along a geographical transect spanning the hybrid zone between Passerina amoena and P. cyanea (Aves: Cardinalidae). Using maximum-likelihood cline fitting methods, we estimated locus-specific introgression rates for 10 z-linked markers. Although the cline width estimates ranged from 2.8 to 584 km, eight of 10 loci had cline widths between 224 and 271 km. We also used coalescent-based estimates of locus-specific divergence times between P. amoena and P. cyanea to test a recently proposed hypothesis of an inverse relationship between divergence time and cline width but did not find a significant association. The narrow width (2.8 km) of the cline estimated from the VLDLR9 locus indicates strong selection retarding introgression of alleles at this locus across the hybrid zone. Interestingly, a mutation in the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) gene, in which VLDLR9 is an intron, is known to reduce the egg-laying ability of some chickens, suggesting a possible link between this gene region and reproductive isolation between P. amoena and P. cyanea. These results underscore the importance of sampling multiple loci to investigate introgression patterns across a chromosome or genome and support previous findings of the importance of sex-linked genes in speciation.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.04038.x		Birds	Passeriformes	Passerina	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal, demographic	amplicons (9 loci)	TRUE	
Carling, Matthew D.; Brumfield, Robb T.	HALDANE'S RULE IN AN AVIAN SYSTEM: USING CLINE THEORY AND DIVERGENCE POPULATION GENETICS TO TEST FOR DIFFERENTIAL INTROGRESSION OF MITOCHONDRIAL, AUTOSOMAL, AND SEX-LINKED LOCI ACROSS THE PASSERINA BUNTING HYBRID ZONE	EVOLUTION	Using cline fitting and divergence population genetics, we tested a prediction of Haldane's rule: autosomal alleles should introgress more than z-linked alleles or mitochondrial haplotypes across the Passerina amoena/Passerina cyanea (Aves: Cardinalidae) hybrid zone. We screened 222 individuals collected along a transect in the Great Plains of North America that spans the contact zone for mitochondrial (two genes), autosomal (four loci) and z-linked (two loci) markers. Maximum-likelihood cline widths estimated from the mitochondrial (223 km) and z-linked (309 km) datasets were significantly narrower on average than the autosomal cline widths (466 km). We also found that mean coalescent-based estimates of introgression were larger for the autosomal loci (0.63 genes/generation, scaled to the mutation rate mu) than for both the mitochondrial (0.27) and z-linked loci (0.59). These patterns are consistent with Haldane's rule, but the among-locus variation also suggests many independently segregating loci are required to investigate introgression patterns across the genome. These results provide the first comprehensive comparison of mitochondrial, sex-linked, and autosomal loci across an avian hybrid zone and add to the body of evidence suggesting that sex chromosomes play an important role in the formation and maintenance of reproductive isolation between closely related species.	2008	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00477.x		Birds	Passeriformes	Passerina	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal, demographic	sanger (8 loci)	TRUE

Molecular and morphological patterns of introgression between two large white-headed gull species in a zone of recent secondary contact	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Incomplete reproductive isolation promotes gene flow between diverging taxa. However, any gene encoding for traits involved in the reproductive barriers will be less prone to introgression than neutral markers. Comparing introgression. rates among loci is thus informative of the number and functions of loci involved in the reproductive barriers. This study aimed at identifying possible mechanisms of restriction to gene flow across a zone of recent secondary contact between Larus argentatus and Larus cachinnans by comparing introgression patterns for nine microsatellite loci, a fragment of mitochondrial DNA and a set of phenotypic traits. The low linkage disequilibrium between neutral nuclear markers indicated introgression. without any barrier to gene flow. However, asymmetric introgression of mitochondrial DNA suggested that interspecific crosses may be more successful in one direction. The introgression rate for phenotypic traits was variable and low compared to neutral molecular markers. This was particularly evident in colouration of bare parts: individuals with intermediate colouration were scarcer in sympatry than expected if the genomes recombined freely. We hypothesized that one of these variables, the orbital ring colour, may play a role in mate choice, acting as an incomplete premating barrier through assortative mating. This study emphasizes that multilocus approaches are useful to discriminate among possible mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of hybrid zones.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03363.x		Birds	Charadriiformes	Larus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, PCA, phenotypic analysis	microsattelites (9 loci)	TRUE

Heterogeneity and concordance in locus-specific differentiation and introgression between species of towhees	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	The maintenance or breakdown of reproductive isolation is an observable outcome of secondary contact between species. In cases where hybrids beyond the F1 are formed, the representation of each species' ancestry can vary dramatically among genomic regions. This genomic heterogeneity in ancestry and introgression can offer insight into evolutionary processes, particularly if introgression is compared in multiple hybrid zones. Similarly, considerable heterogeneity exists across the genome in the extent to which populations and species have diverged, reflecting the combined effects of different evolutionary processes on genetic variation. We studied hybridization across two hybrid zones of two phenotypically well-differentiated bird species in Mexico (Pipilo maculatus and P.ocai), to investigate genomic heterogeneity in differentiation and introgression. Using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and hierarchical Bayesian models, we genotyped 460 birds at over 41000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. We identified loci exhibiting extreme introgression relative to the genome-wide expectation using a Bayesian genomic cline model. We also estimated locus-specific F-ST and identified loci with exceptionally high genetic divergence between the parental species. We found some concordance of locus-specific introgression in the two independent hybrid zones (6-20% of extreme loci shared across zones), reflecting areas of the genome that experience similar gene flow when the species interact. Additionally, heterogeneity in introgression and divergence across the genome revealed another subset of loci under the influence of locally specific factors. These results are consistent with a history in which reproductive isolation has been influenced by a common set of loci in both hybrid zones, but where local environmental and stochastic factors also lead to genomic differentiation.	2017	10.1111/jeb.13033		Birds	Passeriformes	Pipulo	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, clinal analysis	RAD (41324 loci)	TRUE	
Kingston, Sarah E.; Jernigan, Robert W.; Fagan, William F.; Braun, David; Braun, Michael J.	Genomic variation in cline shape across a hybrid zone	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybrid zones are unique biological interfaces that reveal both population level and species level evolutionary processes. A genome-scale approach to assess gene flow across hybrid zones is vital, and now possible. In Mexican towhees (genus Pipilo), several morphological hybrid gradients exist. We completed a genome survey across one such gradient (9 populations, 140 birds) using mitochondrial DNA, 28 isozyme, and 377 AFLP markers. To assess variation in introgression among loci, cline parameters (i.e., width, center) for the 61 clinally varying loci were estimated and compiled into genomic distributions for tests against three empirical models spanning the range of observed cline shape. No single model accounts for observed variation in cline shape among loci. Numerous backcross individuals near the gradient center confirm a hybrid origin for these populations, contrary to a previous hypothesis based on social mimicry and character displacement. In addition, the observed variation does not bin into well-defined categories of locus types (e. g., neutral vs. highly selected). Our multi-locus analysis reveals cross-genomic variation in selective constraints on gene flow and locus-specific flexibility in the permeability of the interspecies membrane.	2012	10.1002/ece3.375		Birds	Passeriformes	Pipilo	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal analysis, sequence similarity	mtDNA (3 loci), isozymes (39 loci), AFLP (377 loci)	TRUE	
Kingston, Sarah E.; Navarro-Sigueenza, Adolfo G.; Garcia-Trejo, Erick A.; Vazquez-Miranda, Hernan; Fagan, William F.; Braun, Michael J.	Genetic differentiation and habitat connectivity across towhee hybrid zones in Mexico	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY	Hybridization can either reinforce or erode species boundaries; therefore, hybrid zones offer a natural experimental setting in which to assess the dynamics of reproductive isolation. Secondary contact zones, in particular, present a partial separation of the original divergence mechanisms and the subsequent genomic architecture of reproductive isolation (or lack thereof). The spatial context of secondary contact and its consequent effect on dispersal play vital roles on the contact's outcome. In a hybrid complex between two towhee species in Mexico, Pipilo maculatus and Pipilo ocai, two major hybrid gradients provide natural replicates for comparison. However, genetic analyses demonstrate significant divergence between geographically separate parental populations of each species and divergence of populations within each hybrid zone. The two hybrid transects (Teziutlan and Transvolcanic) are distinct and evidence suggests allelic introgression both across the species boundary and between the two transects. Habitat corridors for dispersal represent functional connectivity hotspots where the two transects meet. Both habitat connectivity and genetic differentiation between geographically disparate parental populations appear to influence the dynamics of gene flow across the hybrid gradients. In southern sympatric populations (Mt. Orizaba and Oaxaca) where morphological evidence for hybridization is scarce, opposing species' alleles appear to traverse through the hybrid zones rather than arising from cryptic local hybridization. These results illustrate the importance of environmentally mediated gene flow in the context of secondary contact as an important force influencing evolutionary trajectory.	2014	10.1007/s10682-013-9673-8		Birds	Passeriformes	Pipilo	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal, haplotype network, demography, STRUCTURE	mtDNA (1 locus), AFLP (477 loci)	TRUE

Epistatic mutations under divergent selection govern phenotypic variation in the crow hybrid zone	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	The evolution of genetic barriers opposing interspecific gene flow is key to the origin of new species. Drawing from information on over 400 admixed genomes sourced from replicate transects across the European hybrid zone between all-black carrion crows and grey-coated hooded crows, we decipher the interplay between phenotypic divergence and selection at the molecular level. Over 68% of plumage variation was explained by epistasis between the gene NDP and a similar to 2.8-megabase region on chromosome 18 with suppressed recombination. Both pigmentation loci showed evidence for divergent selection resisting introgression. This study reveals how few, large-effect loci can govern prezygotic isolation and shield phenotypic divergence from gene flow.	2019	10.1038/s41559-019-0847-9		Birds	Passeriformes	Corvus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal analysis, Fst, PCA, newhybrids	ChipSeq (1152 loci)	TRUE

The genomic consequences of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between species of manakins	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The processes of adaptation and speciation are expected to shape genomic variation within and between diverging species. Here we analyze genomic heterogeneity of genetic differentiation and introgression in a hybrid zone between two bird species (Manacus candei and M. vitellinus) using 59100 SNPs, a whole genome assembly, and Bayesian models. Measures of genetic differentiation (FST) and introgression (genomic cline center [] and rate []) were highly heterogeneous among loci. We identified thousands of loci with elevated parameter estimates, some of which are likely to be associated with variation in fitness in Manacus populations. To analyze the genomic organization of differentiation and introgression, we mapped SNPs onto a draft assembly of the M. vitellinus genome. Estimates of FST, , and were autocorrelated at very short physical distances (<100 bp), but much less so beyond this. In addition, average statistical associations (linkage disequilibrium) between SNPs were generally low and were not higher in admixed populations than in populations of the parental species. Although they did not occur with a constant probability across the genome, loci with elevated FST, , and were not strongly co-localized in the genome. Contrary to verbal models that predict clustering of loci involved in adaptation and isolation in discrete genomic regions, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic regions involved in adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation are scattered throughout the genome. We also found that many loci were characterized by both exceptional genetic differentiation and introgression, consistent with the hypothesis that loci involved in isolation are also often characterized by a history of divergent selection. However, the concordance between isolation and differentiation was only partial, indicating a complex architecture and history of loci involved in isolation.	2013	10.1111/mec.12201		Birds	Passeriformes	Manacus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal analysis, Fst	GBS (59100 loci)	TRUE	
Baldassarre, Daniel T.; White, Thomas A.; Karubian, Jordan; Webster, Michael S.	GENOMIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF A SEMIPERMEABLE AVIAN HYBRID ZONE SUGGESTS ASYMMETRICAL INTROGRESSION OF A SEXUAL SIGNAL	EVOLUTION	Hybrid zones are geographic regions where differentiated taxa meet and potentially exchange genes. Increasingly, genomic analyses have demonstrated that many hybrid zones are semipermeable boundaries across which introgression is highly variable. In some cases, certain alleles penetrate across the hybrid zone in only one direction, recombining into the alternate genome. We investigated this phenomenon using genomic (genotyping-by-sequencing) and morphological (plumage reflectance spectrophotometry) analyses of the hybrid zone between two subspecies of the red-backed fairy-wren (Malurus melanocephalus) that differ conspicuously in a sexual signal, male back plumage color. Geographic cline analyses revealed a highly variable pattern of differential introgression, with many narrow coincident clines combined with several significantly wider clines, suggesting that the hybrid zone is a semipermeable tension zone. The plumage cline was shifted significantly into the genomic background of the orange subspecies, consistent with sexual selection driving asymmetrical introgression of red plumage alleles across the hybrid zone. This interpretation is supported by previous experimental work demonstrating an extra-pair mating advantage for red males, but the role of genetic dominance in driving this pattern remains unclear. This study highlights the potential for sexual selection to erode taxonomic boundaries and promote gene flow, particularly at an intermediate stage of divergence.	2014	10.1111/evo.12457		Birds	Passeriformes	Malurus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal analysis, phenotypes, STRUCTURE	GBS (2702 loci)	TRUE

Effects of assortative mate choice on the genomic and morphological structure of a hybrid zone between two bird subspecies	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Phenotypic differentiation plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of reproductive barriers. In some cases, variation in a few key aspects of phenotype can promote and maintain divergence; hence, the identification of these traits and their associations with patterns of genomic divergence is crucial for understanding the patterns and processes of population differentiation. We studied hybridization between the alba and personata subspecies of the white wagtail (Motacilla alba), and quantified divergence and introgression of multiple morphological traits and 19,437 SNP loci on a 3,000 km transect. Our goal was to identify traits that may contribute to reproductive barriers and to assess how variation in these traits corresponds to patterns of genome-wide divergence. Variation in only one trait-head plumage patterning-was consistent with reproductive isolation. Transitions in head plumage were steep and occurred over otherwise morphologically and genetically homogeneous populations, whereas cline centres for other traits and genomic ancestry were displaced over 100 km from the head cline. Field observational data show that social pairs mated assortatively by head plumage, suggesting that these phenotypes are maintained by divergent mating preferences. In contrast, variation in all other traits and genetic markers could be explained by neutral diffusion, although weak ecological selection cannot be ruled out. Our results emphasize that assortative mating may maintain phenotypic differences independent of other processes shaping genome-wide variation, consistent with other recent findings that raise questions about the relative importance of mate choice, ecological selection and selectively neutral processes for divergent evolution.	2017	10.1111/mec.14376		Birds	Passeriformes	Motacilla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	clinal, STRUCTURE, morphology	GBS (19437)	TRUE

Walsh, Jennifer; Kovach, Adrienne I.; Olsen, Brian J.; Shriver, W. Gregory; Lovette, Irby J.	Bidirectional adaptive introgression between two ecologically divergent sparrow species	EVOLUTION	Natural hybrid zones can be used to dissect the mechanisms driving key evolutionary processes by allowing us to identify genomic regions important for establishing reproductive isolation and that allow for transfer of adaptive variation. We leverage whole-genome data in a system where two bird species, the saltmarsh (Ammospiza caudacuta) and Nelson's (A. nelsoni) sparrow, hybridize despite their relatively high background genetic differentiation and past ecological divergence. Adaptive introgression is plausible in this system because Nelson's sparrows are recent colonists of saltwater marshes, compared to the specialized saltmarsh sparrow that has a longer history of saltmarsh adaptation. Comparisons among whole-genome sequences of 34 individuals from allopatric and sympatric populations show that ongoing gene flow is shaping the genomic landscape, with allopatric populations exhibiting genome-wide F-ST estimates close to double of that observed in sympatry. We characterized patterns of introgression across the genome and identify regions that exhibit biased introgression into hybrids from one parental species. These regions offer compelling candidates for genes related to tidal marsh adaptations suggesting that adaptive introgression may be an important consequence of hybridization. These findings highlight the value of considering the landscapes of both genome-wide introgression and divergence when characterizing the evolutionary forces that drive speciation.	2018	10.1111/evo.13581		Birds	Passeriformes	Ammospiza	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	fD, PCA, ADMIXTURE, sequence similarity, f3, 	WGS (5587084 loci)	TRUE

Schweizer, Manuel; Warmuth, Vera; Kakhki, Niloofar Alaei; Aliabadian, Mansour; Foerschler, Marc; Shirihai, Hadoram; Suh, Alexander; Burri, Reto	Parallel plumage colour evolution and introgressive hybridization in wheatears	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Genetic and phenotypic mosaics, in which various phenotypes and different genomic regions show discordant patterns of species or population divergence, offer unique opportunities to study the role of ancestral and introgressed genetic variation in phenotypic evolution. Here, we investigated the evolution of discordant phenotypic and genetic divergence in a monophyletic clade of four songbird taxa-pied wheatear (O. pleschanka), Cyprus wheatear (Oenanthe cypriaca), and western and eastern subspecies of black-eared wheatear (O. h. hispanica and O. h. melanoleuca). Phenotypically, black back and neck sides distinguish pied and Cyprus wheatears from the white-backed/necked black-eared wheatears. Meanwhile, mitochondrial variation only distinguishes western black-eared wheatear. In the absence of nuclear genetic data, and given frequent hybridization among eastern black-eared and pied wheatear, it remains unclear whether introgression is responsible for discordance between mitochondrial divergence patterns and phenotypic similarities, or whether plumage coloration evolved in parallel. Multispecies coalescent analyses of about 20,000 SNPs obtained from RAD data mapped to a draft genome assembly resolve the species tree, provide evidence for the parallel evolution of colour phenotypes and establish western and eastern black-eared wheatears as independent taxa that should be recognized as full species. The presence of the entire admixture spectrum in the Iranian hybrid zone and the detection of footprints of introgression from pied into eastern black-eared wheatear beyond the hybrid zone despite strong geographic structure of ancestry proportions furthermore suggest a potential role for introgression in parallel plumage colour evolution. Our results support the importance of standing heterospecific and/or ancestral variation in phenotypic evolution.	2019	10.1111/jeb.13401		Birds	Passeriformes	Oenantha	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	PCA, ADMIXTURE, Patterson's D, treemix	RAD (27334 loci)	TRUE

A comparison of genomic islands of differentiation across three young avian species pairs	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Detailed evaluations of genomic variation between sister species often reveal distinct chromosomal regions of high relative differentiation (i.e., "islands of differentiation" in F-ST), but there is much debate regarding the causes of this pattern. We briefly review the prominent models of genomic islands of differentiation and compare patterns of genomic differentiation in three closely related pairs of New World warblers with the goal of evaluating support for the four models. Each pair (MacGillivray's/mourning warblers; Townsend's/black-throated green warblers; and Audubon's/myrtle warblers) consists of forms that were likely separated in western and eastern North American refugia during cycles of Pleistocene glaciations and have now come into contact in western Canada, where each forms a narrow hybrid zone. We show strong differences between pairs in their patterns of genomic heterogeneity in F-ST, suggesting differing selective forces and/or differing genomic responses to similar selective forces among the three pairs. Across most of the genome, levels of within-group nucleotide diversity (pi(Within)) are almost as large as levels of between-group nucleotide distance (pi(Between)) within each pair, suggesting recent common ancestry and/or gene flow. In two pairs, a pattern of the F-ST peaks having low pi(Between) suggests that selective sweeps spread between geographically differentiated groups, followed by local differentiation. This "sweep-before-differentiation" model is consistent with signatures of gene flow within the yellow-rumped warbler species complex. These findings add to our growing understanding of speciation as a complex process that can involve phases of adaptive introgression among partially differentiated populations.	2018	10.1111/mec.14858		Birds	Passeriformes	Geothlypis, Setophaga	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	sequence similarity, PCA, D stats	GBS (480714 loci)	TRUE

A history of hybrids? Genomic patterns of introgression in the True Geese	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: The impacts of hybridization on the process of speciation are manifold, leading to distinct patterns across the genome. Genetic differentiation accumulates in certain genomic regions, while divergence is hampered in other regions by homogenizing gene flow, resulting in a heterogeneous genomic landscape. A consequence of this heterogeneity is that genomes are mosaics of different gene histories that can be compared to unravel complex speciation and hybridization events. However, incomplete lineage sorting (often the outcome of rapid speciation) can result in similar patterns. New statistical techniques, such as the D-statistic and hybridization networks, can be applied to disentangle the contributions of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. We unravel patterns of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting during and after the diversification of the True Geese (family Anatidae, tribe Anserini, genera Anser and Branta) using an exon-based hybridization network approach and taking advantage of discordant gene tree histories by re-sequencing all taxa of this clade. In addition, we determine the timing of introgression and reconstruct historical effective population sizes for all goose species to infer which demographic or biogeographic factors might explain the observed patterns of introgression. Results: We find indications for ancient interspecific gene flow during the diversification of the True Geese and were able to pinpoint several putative hybridization events. Specifically, in the genus Branta, both the ancestor of the White-cheeked Geese (Hawaiian Goose, Canada Goose, Cackling Goose and Barnacle Goose) and the ancestor of the Brent Goose hybridized with Red-breasted Goose. One hybridization network suggests a hybrid origin for the Red-breasted Goose, but this scenario seems unlikely and it not supported by the D-statistic analysis. The complex, highly reticulated evolutionary history of the genus Anser hampered the estimation of ancient hybridization events by means of hybridization networks. The reconstruction of historical effective population sizes shows that most species showed a steady increase during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. These large effective population sizes might have facilitated contact between diverging goose species, resulting in the establishment of hybrid zones and consequent gene flow. Conclusions: Our analyses suggest that the evolutionary history of the True Geese is influenced by introgressive hybridization. The approach that we have used, based on genome-wide phylogenetic incongruence and network analyses, will be a useful procedure to reconstruct the complex evolutionary histories of many naturally hybridizing species groups.	2017	10.1186/s12862-017-1048-2		Birds	Anseriformes	Anser	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	D stats, sequence similarity, networks	exome (5887 genes)	TRUE

They are commonly observed within several orders in wild birds. The domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticus is the most common livestock species. More than 65 billion chickens are raised annually to produce meat and 80 million metric tons of egg for global human consumption by the commercial sector. Unravelling the origin of its genetic diversity has major application for sustainable breeding improvement programmes. Results In this study, we report genome-wide analyses for signatures of introgression between indigenous domestic village chicken and the four wild Gallus species. We first assess the genome-wide phylogeny and divergence time across the genus Gallus. Genome-wide sequence divergence analysis supports a sister relationship between the Grey junglefowl G. sonneratii and Ceylon junglefowl G. lafayettii. Both species form a clade that is sister to the Red junglefowl G. gallus, with the Green junglefowl G. varius the most ancient lineage within the genus. We reveal extensive bidirectional introgression between the Grey junglefowl and the domestic chicken and to a much lesser extent with the Ceylon junglefowl. We identify a single case of Green junglefowl introgression. These introgressed regions include genes with biological functions related to development and immune system. Conclusions Our study shows that while the Red junglefowl is the main ancestral species, introgressive hybridisation episodes have impacted the genome and contributed to the diversity of the domestic chicken, although likely at different levels across its geographic range.	2020	10.1186/s12915-020-0738-1		Birds	Galliformes	Gallus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	Patterson's D, ADMIXTURE, twisst, demography, fD	WGS (91053192 loci)	TRUE

Unfortunately, the introduction of a large number of commercial chickens in the past two decades has had an adverse effect on CICs. Using the chicken 60 K single nucleotide polymorphism chip, we assessed the genetic diversity and population structure of 1,187 chickens, representing eight Chinese indigenous chicken breeds, two hybrid chicken breeds, two ancestral chicken breeds, two commercial populations and additional red jungle fowl. By investigating haplotype similarity, we found extensive gene introgression from commercial broiler to almost all CICs. Approximately 15% of the genome, on average, of CICs was introgressed, ranging from 0.64% for Tibetan chicken to 21.52% for Huiyang Bearded chicken. Further analysis revealed signals consistent with positive selection in the introgression loci. For the first time, we systematically mapped and quantified introgression from commercial broiler to CICs at the whole genome level. Our data provided a usable resource for chicken genetic diversity, and our findings indicated a dire need for protecting the genetic resources of CICs.	2019	10.1111/eva.12742		Birds	Galliformes	Gallus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PHYLIP, SMARTPCA, ADMIXTURE, Fst, haplotype similarity, randomness test, SLiM	WGS (46239 snps)	TRUE	
Kryukov, A. P.	Phylogeography and hybridization of corvid birds in the Palearctic Region	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII	Natural hybridization increases a lot phenotypic and genetic diversity and shapes intra-species patterns, which is a subject of phylogeography. We studied mitochondrial and complete genome variation in the bird family Corvidae, genera Corvus, Pica, Cyanopica, Perisoreus and Nucifraga. In the classic case of natural hybridization between carrion and hooded crows in Siberia, we found no decreased fitness of hybrids, but instead positive assortative mating which should restrict hybrid zone width. Several genetic markers were unable to discriminate between pure carrion and hooded crows. Mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed no difference between carrion and hooded crows, but instead two diverged haplogroups within the eastern part of the distribution range of the carrion crow. NGS resulted in a clear pattern of diversification of pure forms and hybrids (by using SNPs), and showed genomic regions of increased variability, the so-called "speciation islands". Comparing European and Siberian crow hybrid zones, differences in genome regions bearing genes of melanogenesis supposedly under divergent selection were found. Comparative phylogeographic analysis of 10 widely distributed Palearctic species revealed two kinds of patterns: one with a division into two haplogroups, western and eastern, and another one without such a division. These two phylogeographic patterns might be explained by different habitat preferences: mainly open fields for the first group and forests for the second one. One glacial refuge was assigned to the latter group, while west-east group species might have survived in several refuges. One of such species, the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica) has a gap in its range in Transbaikalia, which is currently shrinking before our eyes.The two subspecies divided by this gap differ in phenotype, mtDNA and vocalization. In their young contact zone, some hybridization occurs with small introgression limited by certain post-zygotic isolation.	2019	10.18699/VJ19.487		Birds	Passeriformes	Corvus, Pica, Cyanopica, Perisoreus, Nucifraga	TRUE	FALSE	review paper	FALSE			TRUE	
Barrera-Guzman, Alfredo O.; Aleixo, Alexandre; Shawkey, Matthew D.; Weir, Jason T.	Hybrid speciation leads to novel male secondary sexual ornamentation of an Amazonian bird	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Hybrid speciation is rare in vertebrates, and reproductive isolation arising from hybridization is infrequently demonstrated. Here, we present evidence supporting a hybrid-speciation event involving the genetic admixture of the snow-capped (Lepidothrix nattereri) and opal-crowned (Lepidothrix iris) manakins of the Amazon basin, leading to the formation of the hybrid species, the golden-crowned manakin (Lepidothrix vilasboasi). We used a genome-wide SNP dataset together with analysis of admixture, population structure, and coalescent modeling to demonstrate that the golden-crowned manakin is genetically an admixture of these species and does not represent a hybrid zone but instead formed through ancient genetic admixture. We used spectrophotometry to quantify the coloration of the species-specific male crown patches. Crown patches are highly reflective white (snow-capped manakin) or iridescent whitish-blue to pink (opal-crowned manakin) in parental species but are a much less reflective yellow in the hybrid species. The brilliant coloration of the parental species results from nanostructural organization of the keratin matrix feather barbs of the crown. However, using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the structural organization of this matrix is different in the two parental species and that the hybrid species is intermediate. The intermediate nature of the crown barbs, resulting from past admixture appears to have rendered a duller structural coloration. To compensate for reduced brightness, selection apparently resulted in extensive thickening of the carotenoid-laden barb cortex, producing the yellow crown coloration. The evolution of this unique crown-color signal likely culminated in premating isolation of the hybrid species from both parental species	2018	10.1073/pnas.1717319115		Birds	Passeriformes	Lepidothrix	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PCoA, STRUCTURE, fineRADstructure, SplitsTree, Fst, FASTSIMCOAL2	GBS (dataset 1: 16281 snps/dataset 2: 7394 snps/dataset 3: 10298snps), mtDNA (1 gene)	TRUE	
Billerman, Shawn M.; Cicero, Carla; Bowie, Rauri C. K.; Carling, Matthew D.	Phenotypic and genetic introgression across a moving woodpecker hybrid zone	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	In hybrid zones in which two divergent taxa come into secondary contact and interbreed, selection can maintain phenotypic diversity despite widespread genetic introgression. Red-br easted (Sphyrapicus ruber) and red-naped (S. nuchalis) sapsuckers meet and hybridi ze along a narrow contact zone that stretches from northern California to southern British Columbia. We found strong evidence for changes in the structure of thi s hybrid zone across time, with significant temporal shifts in allele frequencies and in the proportions of parental phenotypes across the landscape. In addition to these shifts, we found that differences in plumage predict genetic differences (R-2 = 0.80), suggesting that plumage is a useful proxy for assessing ancestry. We also found a significant bimodal distribution of hybrids across the contact zone, suggesting that premating barriers may be driving reproductive isolation, perhaps as a result of assortative mating based on plumage differences. However, despite evidence of selecti on and strong patterns of population structure between parental samples, we found only weak patterns of genetic divergence. Using museum specimens and genomic data, this study of sapsuckers provides insight into the ways in which phenotypic and genetic structure have changed over a 40-year period, as well as insight into the mechanisms that may contribute to the maintenance of the hybrid zone over time.	2019	10.1111/mec.15043		Birds	Piciformes	Sphyrapicus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	Fst, dXY,  STRUCTURE, PCA, morphological data	GBS (13832 snps)	TRUE	
Schmidt, Kari L.; Aardema, Matthew L.; Amato, George	Genetic analysis reveals strong phylogeographical divergences within the Scarlet Macaw Ara macao	IBIS	Scarlet Macaws Ara macao have the largest geographical distribution of any Neotropical psittacine, occupying a variety of lowland forest habitats from Mexico to Brazil. Two subspecies, Ara macao macao and Ara macao cyanoptera, are currently recognized based on wing chord length and plumage coloration, with formal descriptions suggesting genetic introgression in southern Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica. The present study aimed to investigate the extent of genetic diversification within A. macao by analysing mitochondrial sequence data from contemporary and historical samples. Phylogenetic reconstruction and population aggregation analysis confirmed two distinct phylogeographical groups, with a high degree of intraspecific genetic structure and no evidence of a putative hybrid zone. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing further confirmed substantial divergence (similar to 1.8%) between the cyanoptera and macao lineages. These results demonstrate a separation of A. macao into two distinct evolutionary entities and highlight a non-uniform distribution of intraspecific diversity, suggesting current conservation designations may warrant re-evaluation.		10.1111/ibi.12760		Birds	Psitacciformes	Ara	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PARTITIONFINDER, MRBAYES, RAxML, haplotype similarity, PAA	mtDNA (4 genes)	TRUE	
Barbanera, F; Negro, JJ; Di Giuseppe, G; Bertoncini, F; Cappelli, F; Dini, F	Analysis of the genetic structure of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Galliformes) populations by means of mitochondrial DNA and RAPD markers: a study from central Italy	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION	The strong hunting pressure on the red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa, warranted its inclusion into the list of species of European conservation concern. During the last decades, restocking plans with farmed specimens have counterbalanced the hunting drawings from wild populations. Our concern was the study of A. rufa in the easternmost part of its range, the central Italy, to gain insights into the effects of this compensation practice on the genetic structure of its populations. Partridges from both a geographically isolated, long-time protected, wild population (Pianosa island, Tuscan Archipelago National Park) and two Tuscan farms (Bieri and Scarlino) were investigated. All the specimens were very similar in outward appearance, looking much like to A. rufa. Ninety-six sequences of both Cytochrome b and D-loop Control Region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were analysed to get evidence of ancestry at the population level, whereas, the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was employed to get fingerprinting at the individual level. Pianosa and Bieri populations showed both the A. rufa and Alectoris chukar mtDNA lineages, whereas the Scarlino one only the A. rufa-mtDNA line. However, a spread overall pattern of A. rufa x A. chukar hybridisation among specimens, whatever their mtDNA lineage could result to be, was disclosed by means of RAPD species-specific markers. This is the first genetically documented record of the A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids. The occurrence of the pure, native A. rufa genome in the easternmost part of the species' geographical range may be guessed to be virtual. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar), a species only partly native to Europe, is the most frequently introgressive taxon detected in the genome of hybrid partridges. Both theoretical (evolutionary) and practical (resources management) matters spur to get insight into the geographic origin of the A. chukar hybridizing swarm. The phenotypic A. rufa populations colonizing the easternmost part of the distribution range of this species, the islands of Elba (Italy) and Corsica (France), were investigated. The analysis of both mitochondrial (mtDNA: Cytochrome-b gene plus Control Region: 2,250 characters) and nuclear (Short Tandem Repeats, STR; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA, RAPD) genomes of 25 wild (Elba) and 20 captive (Corsica) partridges, disclosed spread introgression of chukar origin also in these populations. All mtDNA haplotypes of Elba and Corsica partridges along with those we obtained from other A. rufa (total, n = 111: Italy, Spain, France) and A. graeca (n = 6, Italy), were compared with the mtDNA haplotypes of chukars (n = 205) sampled in 20 countries. It was found that the A. chukar genes detected in red-legged (n = 43) and rock partridges (n = 4) of Spain, France and Italy as well as in either introduced (Italy) or native (Greece, Turkey) chukars (n = 35) were all from East Asia. Hence, a well-defined geographic origin of the exotic chukar genes polluting the genome of native Mediterranean A. rufa and A. graeca (inter-specific level) as well as A. chukar (intra-specific level), was demonstrated.	2009	10.1007/s10530-008-9251-0		Birds	Galliformes	Alectoris	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, PUAP, ARLEQUIN, STRUCTURE	mtDNA (2 genes), STR (5 loci), RAPD	TRUE

In particular, massive releases of chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) and/or red-legged x chukar partridge hybrids for hunting purposes have cast serious doubts on the Italian present-day occurrence of wild A. rufa populations not affected by introgressive hybridization. This study investigates the genetic structure of red-legged partridges populations in two ecologically different areas in Northern Italy. Analysis of maternal mitochondrial DNA and biparental microsatellite markers excluded the presence of hybridization in a typical agricultural habitat where hunting and release of reared birds are strictly banned. By contrast, signs of chukar introgression were detected in a perifluvial habitat unusual for the red-legged partridge in Italy. The present study documents the first red-legged partridge population with no genetic evidences of recent chukar introgression presently living in Italy. We recommend that urgent conservation actions are taken to preserve the genetic integrity of this population from the risk of hybridization with farm-reared birds and to support its long-term conservation.	2013	10.1007/s10344-012-0686-3		Birds	Galliformes	Alectoris	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, STRUCTURE	microsatellite (8 loci), mtDNA (1 gene)	TRUE	
Leafloor, James O.; Moore, Jennifer A.; Scribner, Kim T.	A HYBRID ZONE BETWEEN CANADA GEESE (BRANTA CANADENSIS) AND CACKLING GEESE (B. HUTCHINSII)	AUK	We studied patterns of geographic variation in structural size and genetic characteristics of white-cheeked geese inhabiting coastal areas of Hudson Bay, Canada, from northern Manitoba to southern Nunavut to determine the degree of morphological and spatial overlap, if any, between Cackling Geese (Branta hutchinsii) and Canada Geese (B. canadensis) in this region. Most Canada Geese occurred in sub-Arctic habitats south of 59 degrees N latitude, and most Cackling Geese occurred in Arctic habitats north of 60 degrees N, but the two species overlapped in a narrow zone between 59 degrees N and 60 degrees N latitude that coincided with the ecotone between sub-Arctic and Arctic ecozones. Mismatches between morphological and genetic characteristics of some individual females suggested that introgression had occurred in this area, and contrasting patterns in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were consistent with female natal philopatry and male-biased dispersal. Evidence of introgression in the nuclear genome was geographically more widespread than evidence of introgression in the mtDNA genome. We suggest that the persistence of Canada Goose mtDNA in phenotypic Cackling Geese is a result of historical hybridization events that occurred when the Arctic sub-Arctic ecotone was located farther north during a warmer climatic period. Despite evidence of introgression, most birds that we sampled appeared to belong to one or the other parental species, on the basis of their consistent identification using morphological, mtDNA, and nuclear DNA characteristics. We suggest that the area of overlap represents a tension zone between Canada Geese and Cackling Geese that is maintained by behavioral and ecological factors that limit effective dispersal.

Barbanera, F.; Forcina, G.; Guerrini, M.; Dini, F.	Molecular phylogeny and diversity of the Corsican red-legged partridge: hybridization and management issues	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY	The red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa (Phasianidae), is a game bird hunted throughout its range (Italy, France with Corsica Island, Iberian Peninsula). The release into the wild of farmed birds of unknown origin coupled to the hybridization with the exotic chukar Alectoris chukar (East Mediterranean to East Asia) has led to the reduction of the spatial component of genetic variability and to the pollution of the genome of A. rufa, respectively. On the mainland, A. chukar genes occur according a decreasing gradient from Italy to the Iberian Peninsula. Corsica hosts a number of A. rufa x A. chukar hybrids, but at a much lower incidence than nearby Italy. We sampled 97 red-legged partridges in different habitats of Corsica [lower-Mediterranean: Desertu di l'Agriate; rural: Nessa-Felicetu; mountainous: Vivariu-Venacu and Fium'Orbu-Taravu (FT)]. We investigated kinship between Corsican and continental A. rufa populations by sequencing the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Cytochrome-b gene in a subset (n = 60) of island specimens as well as in 105 partridges sampled on mainland Europe. All 97 Corsican partridges were genotyped at eight microsatellite DNA loci in order to estimate intraspecific relationships at a finer scale. We also used microsatellite data from previous studies to compare the genotypes of A. rufa reared in the only island farm with those of wild conspecifics. Corsican partridges grouped in the only statistically reliable and diverging mtDNA clade. Microsatellites provided evidence for the genetic isolation of the FT mountain population, whose low level of hybridization with A. chukar had been unveiled in a former paper. Both mtDNA and microsatellite markers revealed that released captive partridges did not enter the wild breeding populations to any great extent. We suggested banning A. rufa translocation from Corsica to the continent to comply with the disclosed genetic kinship, and vice versa to contain the spreading of A. chukar genes in to the A. rufa population.	2011	10.1111/j.1469-7998.2011.00813.x		Birds	Galliformes	Alectoris	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	MRBAYES, PUAP, MRMODELTEST, NETWORK,  sequence similarity	mtDNA (1 gene), STR (8 loci)	TRUE	
Pons, J-M; Sonsthagen, S.; Dove, C.; Crochet, P-A	Extensive mitochondrial introgression in North American Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus) from the American Herring Gull (Larus smithsonianus) with little nuclear DNA impact	HEREDITY	Recent genetic studies have shown that introgression rates among loci may greatly vary according to their location in the genome. In particular, several cases of mito-nuclear discordances have been reported for a wide range of organisms. In the present study, we examine the causes of discordance between mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA introgression detected in North American populations of the Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinus), a Holarctic species, from the Nearctic North American Herring Gull (Larus smithsonianus). Our results show that extensive unidirectional mtDNA introgression from Larus smithsonianus into Larus marinus in North America cannot be explained by ancestral polymorphism but most likely results from ancient hybridization events occurring when Larus marinus invaded the North America. Conversely, our nuclear DNA results based on 12 microsatellites detected very little introgression from Larus smithsonianus into North American Larus marinus. We discuss these results in the framework of demographic and selective mechanisms that have been postulated to explain mito-nuclear discrepancies. We were unable to demonstrate selection as the main cause of mito-nuclear introgression discordance but cannot dismiss the possible role of selection in the observed pattern. Among demographic explanations, only drift in small populations and bias in mate choice in an invasive context may explain our results. As it is often difficult to demonstrate that selection may be the main factor driving the introgression of mitochondrial DNA in natural populations, we advocate that evaluating alternative demographic neutral hypotheses may help to indirectly support or reject hypotheses invoking selective processes.	2014	10.1038/hdy.2013.98		Birds	Charadriiformes	Larus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, NewHybrids,  FCA	microsatellite (12 loci), mtDNA (2 genes)	TRUE	
Cowles, Sarah A.; Uy, J. Albert C.	Rapid, complete reproductive isolation in two closely related Zosterops White-eye bird species despite broadly overlapping ranges	EVOLUTION	Examining what happens when two closely related species come into secondary contact provides insight into the later stages of the speciation process. The Zosteropidae family of birds is one of the most rapidly speciating vertebrate lineages. Members of this family are highly vagile and geographically widespread, raising the question of how divergence can occur if populations can easily come into secondary contact. On the small island of Kolombangara, two closely related nonsister species of white-eyes, Zosterops kulambangrae and Zosterops murphyi, are distributed along an elevational gradient and come into secondary contact at mid-elevations. We captured 134 individuals of both species along two elevational transects. Using genotyping-by-sequencing data and a mitochondrial marker, we found no evidence of past hybridization events and strong persistence of species boundaries, even though the species have only been diverging for approximately 2 million years. We explore potential reproductive barriers that allow the two species to coexist in sympatry, including premating isolation based on divergence in plumage and song. We also conducted a literature review to determine the time it takes to evolve complete reproductive isolation in congeneric avian species/subspecies in secondary contact (restricted to cases where congeneric taxa are parapatric or have a hybrid zone), finding our study is one of the youngest examples of complete reproductive isolation studied in a genomic context reported in birds.	2019	10.1111/evo.13797		Birds	Passeriformes	Zosterops	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, PCA	GBS (23752 loci)	TRUE

The genomic landscape underlying phenotypic integrity in the face of gene flow in crows	SCIENCE	The importance, extent, and mode of interspecific gene flow for the evolution of species has long been debated. Characterization of genomic differentiation in a classic example of hybridization between all-black carrion crows and gray-coated hooded crows identified genome-wide introgression extending far beyond the morphological hybrid zone. Gene expression divergence was concentrated in pigmentation genes expressed in gray versus black feather follicles. Only a small number of narrow genomic islands exhibited resistance to gene flow. One prominent genomic region (<2 megabases) harbored 81 of all 82 fixed differences (of 8.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms in total) linking genes involved in pigmentation and in visual perception-a genomic signal reflecting color-mediated prezygotic isolation. Thus, localized genomic selection can cause marked heterogeneity in introgression landscapes while maintaining phenotypic divergence.	2014	10.1126/science.1253226		Birds	Passeriformes	Corvus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PCA, seqeunce similarity, trees	WGS (5200000 loci)	TRUE	
Liu, Zhaofeng; He, Liwei; Yuan, Honggang; Yue, Bisong; Li, Jing	CR1 retroposons provide a new insight into the phylogeny of Phasianidae species (Aves: Galliformes)	GENE	Chicken repeat 1 (CR1) elements, a class of retroposons belonging to non-long-terminal repeats, have been recognized as powerful tools for phylogenetic studies. Here we examine the phylogenetic relationships of 11 Phasianidae species based on CR1 retroposons. Together with 19 loci reported previously, a total of 99 CR1 loci were identified from chicken genome and turkey BAC clone sequences. 75 insertion events were used to address the branching order of 11 species in Phasianidae. The topology of our tree suggests that: 1) Gallus gallus possessed a basal phylogenetic position within Phasianidae and was related to Bambusicola thoracica (BSP = 100%); 2) After the split of G. gallus and B. thoracica, Arborophila rufipectus diverged from Phasianidae (BSP = 100%). Nine unambiguous insertion events supported a phylogenetic position of A. rufipectus different to previous mitochondrial data suggesting a hybrid origin or an ancient introgression of A. rufipectus: and 3) 22 CR1 insertion events strongly supported the eight phasianids under investigation sharing a common ancestor. Our study has revisited the phylogenetic position of G. gallus and A. rufipectus and provided a new insight into the phylogeny of Phasianidae birds. It showed that a CR1-based methodology has a great potential to be informative within Phasianidae in resolving relationships of closely related species whose radiation and speciation have occurred very recently.

Gay, L.; Neubauer, G.; Zagalska-Neubauer, M.; Pons, J-M; Bell, D. A.; Crochet, P-A	Speciation with gene flow in the large white-headed gulls: does selection counterbalance introgression?	HEREDITY	We investigated the role of selection in generating and maintaining species distinctness in spite of ongoing gene flow, using two zones of secondary contact between large gull species in Europe (Larus argentatus and Larus cachinnans) and North America (Larus glaucescens and Larus occidentalis). We used the pattern of neutral genetic differentiation at nine microsatellite loci (F-ST) as an indicator of expected changes under neutral processes and compared it with phenotypic differentiation (P-ST) for a large number of traits (size, plumage melanism and coloration of bare parts). Even assuming very low heritability, interspecific divergence between L. glaucescens and L. occidentalis in plumage melanism and orbital ring colour clearly exceeded neutral differentiation. Similarly, melanism of the central primaries was highly divergent between L. argentatus and L. cachinnans. Such divergence is unlikely to have arisen randomly and is therefore attributed to spatially varying selection. Variation in plumage melanism in both transects agrees with Gloger's rule, which suggests that latitude (and associated sun and humidity gradients) could be the selective pressure shaping differentiation in plumage melanism. We suggest that strong species differentiation in orbital ring colour results from sexual selection. We conclude that these large gull species, along with other recently diverged species that hybridize after coming into secondary contact, may differ only in restricted regions of the genome that are undergoing strong disruptive selection because of their phenotypic effects.	2009	10.1038/hdy.2008.99		Birds	Charadriiformes	Larus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	morphological data, Fst, Qst, Pst, STRUCTURE	microsatellite (9 loci)	TRUE

Therefore, it is important when studying speciation and species limits in female-heterogametic species like birds to assess the signature of gene flow in the nuclear genome as well. We studied introgression of microsatellites and mtDNA across a secondary contact zone between coastal and interior lineages of Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) to test for a signature of Haldane's Rule: a narrower cline of introgression in mtDNA compared to nuclear markers. Results: Our initial phylogeographic analysis revealed that there is only one major area of contact between coastal and interior lineages and identified five genetic clusters with strong spatial structuring: Pacific Slope, Interior US, Edwards Plateau (Texas), Northern Mexico, and Southern Mexico. Consistent with predictions from Haldane's Rule, mtDNA showed a narrower cline than nuclear markers across a transect through the hybrid zone. This result is not being driven by female-biased dispersal because neutral diffusion analysis, which included estimates of sex-specific dispersal rates, also showed less diffusion of mtDNA. Lineage-specific plumage traits were associated with nuclear genetic profiles for individuals in the hybrid zone, indicating that these differences are under genetic control. Conclusions: This study adds to a growing list of studies that support predictions of Haldane's Rule using cline analysis of multiple loci of differing inheritance modes, although alternate hypotheses like selection on different mtDNA types cannot be ruled out. That Haldane's Rule appears to be operating in this system suggests a measure of reproductive isolation between the Pacific Slope and interior lineages. Based on a variety of evidence from the phenotype, ecology, and genetics, we recommend elevating three lineages to species level: A. californica (Pacific Slope); A. woodhouseii (Interior US plus Edwards Plateau plus Northern Mexico); A. sumichrasti (Southern Mexico). The distinctive Edwards Plateau population in Texas, which was monophyletic in mtDNA except for one individual, should be studied in greater detail given habitat threat.	2014	10.1186/1471-2148-14-135		Birds	Passeriformes	Aphelocoma	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, cline analysis, BEAST, MRMODELTEST	microsatellite (14 loci), mtDNA (1 gene)	TRUE	
Grossen, Christine; Seneviratne, Sampath S.; Croll, Daniel; Irwin, Darren E.	Strong reproductive isolation and narrow genomic tracts of differentiation among three woodpecker species in secondary contact	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybrid zones allow the measurement of gene flow across the genome, producing insight into the genomic architecture of speciation. Such analysis is particularly powerful when applied to multiple pairs of hybridizing species, as patterns of genomic differentiation can then be related to age of the hybridizing species, providing a view into the build-up of differentiation over time. We examined 33 809 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three hybridizing woodpecker species: Red-breasted, Red-naped and Yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, Sphyrapicus nuchalis and Sphyrapicus varius), two of which (ruber and nuchalis) are much more closely related than each is to the third (varius). To identify positions of SNPs on chromosomes, we developed a localization method based on comparative genomics. We found narrow clines, bimodal distributions of hybrid indices and genomic regions with decreased rates of introgression. These results suggest moderately strong reproductive isolation among species and selection against specific hybrid genotypes. We found 19 small regions of strong differentiation between species, partly shared among species pairs, but no large regions of differentiation. An association analysis revealed a single strong-effect candidate locus associated with plumage, possibly explaining mismatch among the three species in genomic relatedness and plumage similarity. Our comparative analysis of species pairs of different age and their hybrid zones showed that moderately strong reproductive isolation can occur with little genomic differentiation, but that reproductive isolation is incomplete even with much greater genomic differentiation, implying there are long periods of time when hybridization is possible if diverging populations are in geographic contact.	2016	10.1111/mec.13751		Birds	Piciformes	Sphyrapicus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	cline analysis, PCA, STRUCTURE, Fst, morphological data	GBS	TRUE	
Harris, Rebecca B.; Alstrom, Per; Odeen, Anders; Leache, Adam D.	Discordance between genomic divergence and phenotypic variation in a rapidly evolving avian genus (Motacilla)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Generally, genotypes and phenotypes are expected to be spatially congruent; however, in widespread species complexes with few barriers to dispersal, multiple contact zones, and limited reproductive isolation, discordance between phenotypes and phylogeographic groups is more probable. Wagtails (Motacilla) are a genus of birds with striking plumage pattern variation across the Old World. Up to 13 subspecies are recognized within a single species, yet previous studies using mitochondrial DNA have supported polyphyletic phylogeographic groups that are inconsistent with subspecies plumage characteristics. In this study, we investigate the link between phenotypes and genotype by taking a phylogenetic approach. We use genome-wide SNPs, nuclear introns, and mitochondrial DNA to estimate population structure, isolation by distance, and species relationships. Together, our genetic sampling includes complete species-level sampling and comprehensive coverage of the three most phenotypically diverse Palearctic species. Our study provides strong evidence for species-level patterns of differentiation, however population-level differentiation is less pronounced. SNPs provide a robust estimate of species-level relationships, which are mostly corroborated by a combined analysis of mtDNA and nuclear introns (the first time-calibrated species tree for the genus). However, the mtDNA tree is strongly incongruent and is considered to misrepresent the species phylogeny. The extant wagtail lineages originated during the Pliocene and the Eurasian lineage underwent rapid diversification during the Pleistocene. Three of four widespread Eurasian species exhibit an east-west divide that contradicts both subspecies taxonomy and phenotypic variation. Indeed, SNPs fail to distinguish between phenotypically distinct subspecies within the M. alba and M. flava complexes, and instead support geographical regions, each of which is home to two or more different looking subspecies. This is a major step towards our understanding of wagtail phylogeny compared to previous analyses of fewer species and considerably less sequence data.	2018	10.1016/j.ympev.2017.11.020		Birds	Passeriformes	Motacilla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	ADMIXTURE, sequence similarity, trees, IBD	Sanger (5 genes), RAD (8200 loci)	TRUE	
Morales, Hernan E.; Sunnucks, Paul; Joseph, Leo; Pavlova, Alexandra	Perpendicular axes of differentiation generated by mitochondrial introgression	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Differential introgression of mitochondrial vs. nuclear DNA generates discordant patterns of geographic variation and can promote population divergence and speciation. We examined a potential case of mitochondrial introgression leading to two perpendicular axes of differentiation. The Eastern Yellow Robin Eopsaltria australis, a widespread Australian bird, shows a deep mitochondrial split that is perpendicular to north-south nuclear DNA and plumage colour differentiation. We propose a scenario to explain this pattern: (i) first, both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes differentiated in concert during north-south population divergence; (ii) later, their histories disconnected after two mitochondrial introgression events resulting in a deep mitochondrial split perpendicular to the nuclear DNA structure. We explored this scenario by coalescent modelling of ten mitochondrial genes and 400 nuclear DNA loci. Initial mitochondrial and nuclear genome divergences were estimated to have occurred in the early Pleistocene, consistent with the proposed scenario. Subsequent climatic transitions may have driven later mitochondrial introgression. We consider neutral introgression unlikely and instead propose that the evidence is more consistent with adaptive mitochondrial introgression and selection against incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear combinations. This likely generated an axis of coastal-inland mitochondrial differentiation in the face of nuclear gene flow, perpendicular to the initial north-south axis of differentiation (reflected in genomewide nuclear DNA and colour variation).	2017	10.1111/mec.14114		Birds	Passeriformes	Eopsaltria	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, demographic modeling	Sanger, Probe capture (400 haplotypes), 	TRUE	
Shipilina, Daria; Serbyn, Maksym; Ivanitskii, Vladimir; Marova, Irina; Backstrom, Niclas	Patterns of genetic, phenotypic, and acoustic variation across a chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita abietinus/tristis) hybrid zone	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Characterizing patterns of evolution of genetic and phenotypic divergence between incipient species is essential to understand how evolution of reproductive isolation proceeds. Hybrid zones are excellent for studying such processes, as they provide opportunities to assess trait variation in individuals with mixed genetic background and to quantify gene flow across different genomic regions. Here, we combine plumage, song, mtDNA and whole-genome sequence data and analyze variation across a sympatric zone between the European and the Siberian chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita abietinus/tristis) to study how gene exchange between the lineages affects trait variation. Our results show that chiffchaff within the sympatric region show more extensive trait variation than allopatric birds, with a large proportion of individuals exhibiting intermediate phenotypic characters. The genomic differentiation between the subspecies is lower in sympatry than in allopatry and sympatric birds have a mix of genetic ancestry indicating extensive ongoing and past gene flow. Patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation also vary between regions within the hybrid zone, potentially reflecting differences in population densities, age of secondary contact, or differences in mate recognition or mate preference. The genomic data support the presence of two distinct genetic clades corresponding to allopatric abietinus and tristis and that genetic admixture is the force underlying trait variation in the sympatric region-the previously described subspecies ("fulvescens") from the region is therefore not likely a distinct taxon. In addition, we conclude that subspecies identification based on appearance is uncertain as an individual with an apparently distinct phenotype can have a considerable proportion of the genome composed of mixed alleles, or even a major part of the genome introgressed from the other subspecies. Our results provide insights into the dynamics of admixture across subspecies boundaries and have implications for understanding speciation processes and for the identification of specific chiffchaff individuals based on phenotypic characters.	2017	10.1002/ece3.2782		Birds	Passeriformes	Phylloscopus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, Fst	mtDNA (1 gene), WGS (1233236 loci)	TRUE	
Wang, Wenjuan; Wang, Yafang; Lei, Fumin; Liu, Yang; Wang, Haitao; Chen, Jiakuan	Incomplete lineage sorting and introgression in the diversification of Chinese spot-billed ducks and mallards	CURRENT ZOOLOGY	Incomplete lineage sorting and introgression are 2 major and nonexclusive causes of species-level non-monophyly. Distinguishing between these 2 processes is notoriously difficult because they can generate similar genetic signatures. Previous studies have suggested that 2 closely related duck species, the Chinese spot-billed duck Anas zonorhyncha and the mallard A. platyrhynchos were polyphyletically intermixed. Here, we utilized a wide geographical sampling, multilocus data and a coalescent-based model to revisit this system. Our study confirms the finding that Chinese spot-billed ducks and Mallards are not monophyletic. There was no apparent interspecific differentiation across loci except those at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and the Z chromosome (CHD1Z). Based on an isolation-with-migration model and the geographical distribution of lineages, we suggest that both introgression and incomplete lineage sorting might contribute to the observed non-monophyly of the 2 closely related duck species. The mtDNA introgression was asymmetric, with high gene flow from Chinese spot-billed ducks to Mallards and negligible gene flow in the opposite direction. Given that the 2 duck species are phenotypically distinctive but weakly genetically differentiated, future work based on genome-scale data is necessary to uncover genomic regions that are involved in divergence, and this work may provide further insights into the evolutionary histories of the 2 species and other waterfowls.	2019	10.1093/cz/zoy074		Birds	Anseriformes	Anas	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, Fst, haplotype networks	Sanger (15 genes)	TRUE	
Sardell, Jason M.; Uy, J. Albert C.	Hybridization following recent secondary contact results in asymmetric genotypic and phenotypic introgression between island species of Myzomela honeyeaters	EVOLUTION	Hybridization and introgression can have important evolutionary consequences for speciation, especially during early stages of secondary contact when reproductive barriers may be weak. Few studies, however, have quantified dynamics of hybridization and introgression in systems in which recent natural dispersal across a geographic barrier resulted in secondary contact. We investigated patterns of hybridization and introgression between two Myzomela honeyeaters (M. tristrami and M. cardinalis) that recently achieved secondary contact on Makira in the Solomon Islands. Hybridization in this system was hypothesized to be a byproduct of conspecific mate scarcity during early stages of colonization. Our research, however, provides evidence of ongoing hybridization more than a century after secondary contact. Mitochondrial sequencing revealed strongly asymmetric reproductive isolation that is most likely driven by postzygotic incompatibilities rather than prezygotic behavioral barriers. Nuclear introgression was observed from the native species (M. tristrami) to the colonizing species (M. cardinalis). Nuclear introgression in the reverse direction is almost exclusively limited to birds that are phenotypically M. tristrami but possess M. cardinalis mitochondrial haplotypes, consistent with introgression of plumage-related alleles into the genomic background of M. cardinalis. These results provide unique insight into the dynamics and consequences of hybridization and introgression during early stages of secondary contact.	2016	10.1111/evo.12864		Birds	Passeriformes	Myzomela	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, mtDNA patterns, sequence similarity	Sanger (7 genes)	TRUE

Assessing the genetic impact of massive restocking on wild mallard	ANIMAL CONSERVATION	Captive-bred mallards Anas platyrhynchos have been released for hunting purposes at a very large scale in Europe since the mid-1970s. In spite of a potential genetic impact, the actual contribution of restocked mallards to the genome of the target population has received little attention. The genetic structure of modern wild mallards in the Camargue, Southern France, was assessed from two samples: one originating from shot birds in hunting bags and one from presumed wild ducks captured alive in a hunting-free reserve. Reference samples originated from five mallard farms, as well as from museum samples collected before the mid-1970s (i.e. before massive mallard releases started). Our results revealed that the genetic signature of wild wintering mallards has not changed significantly because museum and presumed wild samples from the Camargue hunting-free nature reserve were genetically similar, and clearly differentiated from the farm mallards. This suggests that mallard releases in the Camargue or elsewhere in France, although massive, have not actually translated into complete admixture of wild and captive genomes, most likely due to low survival of released birds once in the wild. Nevertheless, although genetic introgression of the wild population by captive-bred was contained, we found significant rates of hybridization between wild and captive-bred mallards in modern samples. This result suggests that long-term releases of captive-bred mallards, if carried on at such large scale, could compromise irreversibly the genetic structure and composition of European mallards. This work contributes to fill in the gap on the monitoring of the genetic consequences of large-scale game releases for exploitation.	2013	10.1111/j.1469-1795.2012.00600.x		Birds	Anseriformes	Anas	TRUE	TRUE	domestic-wild hybrid detection	TRUE	STRUCTURE, newhybrids, Fst	microsattelites (14 loci)	TRUE	
Backstrom, Niclas; Saetre, Glenn-Peter; Ellegren, Hans	Inferring the demographic history of European Ficedula flycatcher populations	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Inference of population and species histories and population stratification using genetic data is important for discriminating between different speciation scenarios and for correct interpretation of genome scans for signs of adaptive evolution and trait association. Here we use data from 24 intronic loci re-sequenced in population samples of two closely related species, the pied flycatcher and the collared flycatcher. Results: We applied Isolation-Migration models, assignment analyses and estimated the genetic differentiation and diversity between species and between populations within species. The data indicate a divergence time between the species of <1 million years, significantly shorter than previous estimates using mtDNA, point to a scenario with unidirectional gene-flow from the pied flycatcher into the collared flycatcher and imply that barriers to hybridisation are still permeable in a recently established hybrid zone. Furthermore, we detect significant population stratification, predominantly between the Spanish population and other pied flycatcher populations. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence for a divergence process where different genomic regions may be at different stages of speciation. We also conclude that forthcoming analyses of genotype-phenotype relations in these ecological model species should be designed to take population stratification into account.	2013	10.1186/1471-2148-13-2		Birds	Passeriformes	Ficedula	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	structure, pca, fst	sanger (14 markers)	TRUE	
Alcaide, Miguel; Scordato, Elizabeth S. C.; Price, Trevor D.; Irwin, Darren E.	Genomic divergence in a ring species complex	NATURE	Ring species provide particularly clear demonstrations of how one species can gradually evolve into two, but are rare in nature(1-3). In the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) species complex, a ring of populations wraps around Tibet. Two reproductively isolated forms co-exist in central Siberia, with a gradient of genetic and phenotypic characteristics through the southern chain of populations connecting them(4-6). Previous genetic evidence has proven inconclusive, however, regarding whether species divergence took place in the face of continuous gene flow and whether hybridization between the terminal forms of the ring ever occurred(7-9). Here we use genome-wide analyses to show that, although spatial patterns of genetic variation are currently mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene flow have existed at more than one location around the ring, and the two Siberian forms have occasionally interbred. Substantial periods of geographical isolation occurred not only in the north but also in the western Himalayas, where there is now an extensive hybrid zone between genetically divergent forms. Limited asymmetric introgression has occurred directly between the Siberian forms, although it has not caused a blending of those forms, suggesting selection against introgressed genes in the novel genetic background. Levels of reproductive isolation and genetic introgression are consistent with levels of phenotypic divergence around the ring, with phenotypic similarity and extensive interbreeding across the southwestern contact zone and strong phenotypic divergence and nearly complete reproductive isolation across the northern contact zone. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the greenish warbler should be viewed as a rare example of speciation by distance(6), but demonstrate that the greenish warbler displays a continuum from slightly divergent neighbouring populations to almost fully reproductively isolated species.	2014	10.1038/nature13285		Birds	Passeriformes	Phylloscopus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PCA, STRUCTURE, clines	GBS (2334 loci)	TRUE	
Gagnaire, P. A.; Albert, V.; Jonsson, B.; Bernatchez, L.	Natural selection influences AFLP intraspecific genetic variability and introgression patterns in Atlantic eels	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Investigating patterns of genetic variation in hybridizing species provides an opportunity to understand the impact of natural selection on intraspecific genetic variability and interspecific gene exchange. The Atlantic eels Anguilla rostrata and A. anguilla each occupy a large heterogeneous habitat upon which natural selection could differentially shape genetic variation. They also produce viable hybrids only found in Iceland. However, the possible footprint of natural selection on patterns of genetic variation within species and introgressive hybridization in Icelandic eels has never been assessed. We revisited amplified fragment length polymorphism data collected previously using population genomics and admixture analyses to test if (i) genetic variation could be influenced by non-neutral mechanisms at both the intra- and interspecific levels, and if (ii) selection could shape the spatio-temporal distribution of Icelandic hybrids. We first found candidate loci for directional selection within both species. Spatial distributions of allelic frequencies displayed by some of these loci were possibly related with the geographical patterns of life-history traits in A. rostrata, and could have been shaped by natural selection associated with an environmental gradient along European coasts in A. anguilla. Second, we identified outlier loci at the interspecific level. Non-neutral introgression was strongly suggested for some of these loci. We detected a locus at which typical A. rostrata allele hardly crossed the species genetic barrier, whereas three other loci showed accelerated patterns of introgression into A. anguilla in Iceland. Moreover, the level of introgression at these three loci increased from the glass eel to the yellow eel stage, supporting the hypothesis that differential survival of admixed genotypes partly explains the spatio-temporal pattern of hybrid abundance previously documented in Iceland.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04142.x		Fish	Anguilliformes	Anguilla	TRUE	TRUE	AFLP	TRUE	sequence similarity	AFLP (373 loci)	TRUE	
Gagnaire, Pierre-Alexandre; Minegishi, Yuki; Zenboudji, Saliha; Valade, Pierre; Aoyama, Jun; Berrebi, Patrick	WITHIN-POPULATION STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTED BY DIFFERENTIAL INTROGRESSION ACROSS SEMIPERMEABLE BARRIERS TO GENE FLOW IN ANGUILLA MARMORATA	EVOLUTION	In the marine environment, differential gene exchange between partially reproductively isolated taxa can result in introgression that extends over long distances due to high larval dispersal potential. However, the degree to which this process contributes to interlocus variance of genetic differentiation within introgressed populations remains unclear. Using a genome-scan approach in the Indo-Pacific eel Anguilla marmorata, we investigated the degree of interpopulation genetic differentiation, the rate of introgression, and within-population genetic patterns at 858 AFLP markers genotyped in 1117 individuals. Three divergent populations were identified based on clustering analysis. Genetic assignments of individuals revealed the existence of different types of hybrids that tended to co-occur with parental genotypes in three population contact zones. Highly variable levels of genetic differentiation were found between populations across the AFLP markers, and reduced rates of introgression were shown at some highly differentiated loci. Gene flow across semipermeable genetic barriers was shown to generate spatial introgression patterns at some loci which define within-population structure over long distances. These results suggest that differential introgression in subdivided populations may be relevant when interpreting spatial variation patterns displayed by outlying loci in other marine fish populations.	2011	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01404.x		Fish	Anguilliformes	Anguilla	TRUE	TRUE	AFLP markers	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	AFLP (858 loci)	TRUE	
Schaefer, Jacob; Duvernell, David; Campbell, Dave Cooper	Hybridization and introgression in two ecologically dissimilar Fundulus hybrid zones	EVOLUTION	Hybridization and introgression appear more common in rapidly evolving groups, suggesting an important role in the evolutionary process. Detailed studies of how extrinsic or intrinsic forces regulate hybridization and introgression have the potential for broadening our understanding of mechanisms generating diversity. Species in the Fundulus notatus species complex have broad overlapping ranges and occur in replicated hybrid zones along predictable stream gradients. Typical hybrid zone structure has Fundulus olivaceus in headwaters, F. notatus downstream, and hybrid zones near confluences or abrupt shifts in habitat. Rarely, the typical upstream-downstream orientation is reversed raising questions as to how hybrid zones are formed and maintained. We used next-generation sequencing data to study hybridization and introgression in hybrid zones in neighboring drainages that differ in orientation (typical and reversed). We predicted extrinsic forces linked to stream gradients would result in noticeable differences between the two. Contrary to predictions, the data indicate the hybrid zones are remarkably similar. We used individual-based simulations to explore the potential role of intrinsic and extrinsic forces in generating and maintaining typical and reversed hybrid zones. Simulation results were consistent with reversed hybrid zones being formed from stochastic processes combined with strong intrinsic forces and weak extrinsic forces.	2016	10.1111/evo.12920		Fish	Cyprinidontiformes	Fundulus	TRUE	TRUE	Cline based methods	TRUE	POPTREE2, PCA, STRUCTURE, NewHybrids, Fis, cline analysis	GBS (new dataset: 7988 snps, Glover dataset: 10586 snps, Cossatot dataset: 21868 snps)	TRUE	
Lamaze, Fabien C.; Sauvage, Christopher; Marie, Amandine; Garant, Dany; Bernatchez, Louis	Dynamics of introgressive hybridization assessed by SNP population genomics of coding genes in stocked brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Salmonid fishes rank among species being most severely affected by introgressive hybridization as a result of a long tradition of stocking with hatchery-reared conspecifics. The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the genetic consequences of stocking and resulting introgression rates on the genetic integrity of natural populations of brook charr, (ii) to identify genomic regions potentially associated with adaptation to natural and artificial rearing environments, and (iii) to test the null hypothesis that introgression from domesticated brook charr into wild populations is homogeneous among loci. A total of 336 individuals were sampled from nine lakes, which were stocked at different intensities with domestic fish. Individuals were genotyped at 280 SNPs located in transcribed regions and developed by means of next-generation sequencing. As previously reported with microsatellites, we observed a positive relationship between stocking intensity and genetic diversity among stocking groups, and a decrease in population differentiation. Individual admixture proportions also increased with stocking intensity. Moreover, genomic cline analysis revealed 27 SNPs, seven of which were also identified as outliers in a genome scan, which showed an introgression rate either more restricted or enhanced relative to neutral expectations. This indicated that selection, mainly for growth-related biological processes, has favored or hampered the introgression of genomic blocks into the introgressed wild populations. Overall, this study highlights the usefulness of investigating the impact of stocking on the dynamics of introgression of potentially adaptive genetic variation to better understand the consequences of such practice on the genomic integrity of wild populations.	2012	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05579.x		Fish	Salmoniformes	Salvelinus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	Fis, sequence similarity, STRUCTURE, NewHybrids, cline analysis	RNAseq (280 snps), WGS (231 snps)	TRUE	
Nolte, A. W.; Gompert, Z.; Buerkle, C. A.	Variable patterns of introgression in two sculpin hybrid zones suggest that genomic isolation differs among populations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Theory predicts that reproductive isolation may be due to intrinsic genetic incompatibilities or extrinsic ecological factors. Therefore, an understanding of the genetic basis of isolation may require analyses of evolutionary processes in situ to include environmental factors. Here we study genetic isolation between populations of sculpins (Cottus) at 168 microsatellites. Genomic clines were fit using 480 individuals sampled across independent natural hybrid zones that have formed between one invading species and two separate populations of a resident species. Our analysis tests for deviations from neutral patterns of introgression at individual loci based on expectations given genome-wide admixture. Roughly 51% of the loci analysed displayed significant deviations. An overall deficit of interspecific heterozygotes in 26% and 21% of the loci suggests that widespread underdominance drives genomic isolation. At the same time, selection promotes introgression of almost 30% of the markers, which implies that hybridization may increase the fitness of admixed individuals. Cases of overdominance or epistatic interactions were relatively rare. Despite the similarity of the two hybrid zones in their overall genomic composition, patterns observed at individual loci show little correlation between zones and many fit different genotypic models of fitness. At this point, it remains difficult to determine whether these results are due to differences in external selection pressures or cryptic genetic differentiation of distinct parental populations. In the future, data from mapped genetic markers and on variation of ecological factors will provide additional insights into the contribution of these factors to variation in the evolutionary consequences of hybridization.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04208.x		Fish	Scorpaeniformes	Cottus	TRUE	TRUE	Clinal data	TRUE	cline analysis, hybrid index, sequence similarity	microsattelites (168 loci)	TRUE	
Sinama, Melthide; Gilles, Andre; Costedoat, Caroline; Corse, Emmanuel; Olivier, Jean-Michel; Chappaz, Remi; Pech, Nicolas	Non-homogeneous combination of two porous genomes induces complex body shape trajectories in cyprinid hybrids	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY	Introduction: Hybridization is a common phenomenon in fish and is considered to be a major source of diversification. Deciphering the remoulding of genomic regions and phenotypes in zones where hybrid specimens occur is of particular interest to elucidate the emergence of evolutionary novelties. This approach is particularly challenging because the first step of hybridization seems to be the most important stage in the emergence of hybrid lineages. However, the signal can be significantly altered after only a few generations. Results: We studied 41 microsatellites and partial cytochrome b gene sequences in 970 specimens belonging to two fish species (Chondrostoma nasus and Parachondrostoma toxostoma) in allopatric/parapatric zones, hybrids between them in a natural sympatric zone: the Ardeche basin. We showed that the genomic architecture in hybrids presented pattern heterogeneity of selection for the different loci. Indeed, the upstream part of the river (Rosieres and Labeaume) presented an overdominant fitness of heterozygotes (12.20%) corresponding to a genomic compatibility, and underselection was observed for 4.88%-7.32% of the loci tested indicating a genomic incompatibility. Moreover the upstream station (Rosieres) presented a positive selection of invasive C. nasus homozygotes (17.07% to 21.95%) indicating that hybridization may increase the fitness of admixed individuals. We showed that hybrid morphology (body shape based on 21 landmarks) correlated with genomic dilution indicating a species fingerprint. However, we demonstrated that the hybrid morphology was not a linear modification between the two parental species but a trade-off between several correlated traits. Conclusions: Hybrid specimens present a mosaic of genomic combination, showing regions with genomic compatibility and others with genomic incompatibility between the two species. Positive selection (invasive advantage ranging from 9.76% to 21.95% of the loci) was evidenced in the upstream part of the Ardeche indicating that environmental selection makes a substantial contribution. Although the presence of a dam is known to impose heterogeneous hybrid zones between these two species, we demonstrated in this study that a natural environment can also generate a hybrid zone with a large number (and diversity) of hybrids. The combination of the two genomes in the hybrids results in complex ontogenetic trajectories (with different morphological traits evolving at different rates) that correspond to novel developmental pathways.	2013	10.1186/1742-9994-10-22		Fish	Cyprinodontiformes	Chondrostoma, Parachondrostoma	TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid mapping	TRUE	sequence similarity, STRUCTURE, hybrid index, morphological data	microsattelites (41 loci), mtDNA (1 gene)	TRUE	
Sousa-Santos, C.; Collares-Pereira, M. J.; Almada, V.	Reading the history of a hybrid fish complex from its molecular record	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Squalius alburnoides is a widely distributed intergeneric hybrid complex with fish of both sexes, varying ploidy levels and proportions or the parental genomes. Its dispersal routes were here delineated and framed by the reconstruction of the phylogeny and phylogeography of other Squalius with which it hybridizes, based on the available data on the paleohydrographical history of the Iberian Peninsula. Results based on sequences of cytochrome b and beta-actin genes showed that: proto-Squalius pyrenaicus originated at least five species as it dispersed throughout the Iberian Peninsula in the Mio-Pliocene; the S. alburnoides complex likely had a single origin in the bulk of Iberia, in the Upper Tagus/Guadiana area, when hydrographical rearrangements allowed the contact between its ancestors (around 700,000 years ago); interspecific crosses allowed the introgression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes of S. alburnoides in allopatric species/populations of other Squalius and vice-versa; and reconstituted S. alburnoides non-hybrid males may contribute to the replacement of the typical mtDNA of the complex (in the populations where they occur, crosses with females of other Squalius seem to have been especially frequent). A number of dispersal events and colonization routes are proposed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Introgressive hybridization as a promoter of genome reshuffling in natural homoploid fish hybrids (Cyprinidae, Leuciscinae)	HEREDITY	Understanding the mechanisms underlying diversification and speciation by introgressive hybridization is currently one of the major challenges in evolutionary biology. Here, the analysis of hybridization between two pairs of Iberian Leuciscinae provided new data on independent hybrid zones involving Achondrostoma oligolepis (AOL) and Pseudochondrostoma duriense (PDU), and confirmed the occurrence of hybrids between AOL and Pseudochondrostoma polylepis (PPO). A multilevel survey combining morphological, genetic and cytogenomic markers on a vast population screening successfully sorted the selected fishes as admixed. Results were similar in both AOL x PDU and AOL x PPO systems. Overall, hybrid morphotypes, cytogenomic data and genetic profiling indicated preferential backcrossing and suggested AOL as a major genomic contributor. Moreover, results implied AOL as more permissive to introgression than PDU or PPO. Although PDU- and PPO-like individuals appeared more resilient to genome modifications, AOL appeared to be more involved and affected by the ongoing hybridization events, as chromosomal translocations were only found in AOL-like individuals. All hybrids analysed evidenced extensive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) polymorphism that was not found in parental species, but usually seen falling within the range of possible parental combinations. Yet, transgressive phenotypes that cannot be explained by normal recombination, including more rDNA clusters than expected or the occurrence of syntenic rDNAs, were also detected. Present results proved rapid genomic evolution providing the genetic novelty for species to persist. In addition, although the ultimate consequences of such apparently extensive and recurrent events remain unknown, modern genome-wide methodologies are of great promise towards answering questions concerning the causes, dynamics and impacts of hybridization.	2014	10.1038/hdy.2013.110		Fish	Cypriniformes	Achondrostoma, Pseudochondrostoma	TRUE	TRUE	Cytogenetic methods	TRUE	cytogenetic approach, sequence similarity	sanger (2 genes), microsattelites (10 loci)	TRUE

Arnason, Einar; Halldorsdottir, Katrin	Codweb: Whole-genome sequencing uncovers extensive reticulations fueling adaptation among Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific gadids	SCIENCE ADVANCES	Introgressive hybridization creates networks of genetic relationships across species. Among marine fish of the Gadidae family, Pacific cod and walleye pollock are separate invasions of an Atlantic cod ancestor into the Pacific. Cods are ecological success stories, and their ecologies allow them to support the largest fisheries of the world. The enigmatic walleye pollock differs morphologically, behaviorally, and ecologically from its relatives, representing a niche shift. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic gadids and reveal extensive introgression among them with the ABBA-BABA test and pseudolikelihood phylogenetic network analysis. We propose that walleye pollock resulted from extensive adaptive introgression or homoploid hybrid speciation. The path of evolution of these taxa is more web than a tree. Their ability to invade and expand into new habitats and become ecologically successful may depend on genes acquired through adaptive introgression or hybrid speciation.	2019	10.1126/sciadv.aat8788		Fish	Gadiformes	Gadus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	fD, Dfoil, trees	WGS	TRUE	
Barth, Julia M.

Here, we focus on seven catadromous eel species (genus Anguilla) and use genome-wide sequence data from more than 450 individuals sampled across the tropical Indo-Pacific, morphological information, and three newly assembled draft genomes to compare contemporary patterns of hybridization with signatures of past introgression across a time-calibrated phylogeny. We show that the seven species have remained distinct for up to 10 million years and find that the current frequencies of hybridization across species pairs contrast with genomic signatures of past introgression. Based on near-complete asymmetry in the directionality of hybridization and decreasing frequencies of later-generation hybrids, we suggest cytonuclear incompatibilities, hybrid breakdown, and purifying selection as mechanisms that can support species cohesion even when hybridization has been pervasive throughout the evolutionary history of clades. In the Indo-Pacific, multiple Anguilla eel species overlap in their spawning. Here, the authors sequence three Anguilla genomes and with genome-wide data of four more congeners, investigate contemporary hybridization, historical introgression, and the maintenance of species boundaries despite substantial gene flow.	2020	10.1038/s41467-020-15099-x		Fish	Anguilliformes	Anguilla	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	D stats, nework analysis, gene trees	RAD (1518299 loci)	TRUE	
Bangs, Max R.; Douglas, Marlis R.; Mussmann, Steven M.; Douglas, Michael E.	Unraveling historical introgression and resolving phylogenetic discord within Catostomus (Osteichthys: Catostomidae)	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Porous species boundaries can be a source of conflicting hypotheses, particularly when coupled with variable data and/or methodological approaches. Their impacts can often be magnified when non-model organisms with complex histories of reticulation are investigated. One such example is the genus Catostomus (Osteichthys, Catostomidae), a freshwater fish clade with conflicting morphological and mitochondrial phylogenies. The former is hypothesized as reflecting the presence of admixed genotypes within morphologically distinct lineages, whereas the latter is interpreted as the presence of distinct morphologies that emerged multiple times through convergent evolution. We tested these hypotheses using multiple methods, to including multispecies coalescent and concatenated approaches. Patterson's D-statistic was applied to resolve potential discord, examine introgression, and test the putative hybrid origin of two species. We also applied naive binning to explore potential effects of concatenation. Results: We employed 14,007 loci generated from ddRAD sequencing of 184 individuals to derive the first highly supported nuclear phylogeny for Catostomus. Our phylogenomic analyses largely agreed with a morphological interpretation, with the exception of the placement of Xyrauchen texanus, which differs from both morphological and mitochondrial phylogenies. Additionally, our evaluation of the putative hybrid species C. columbianus revealed a lack introgression and instead matched the mitochondrial phylogeny. Furthermore, D-statistic tests clarified all discrepancies based solely on mitochondrial data, with agreement among topologies derived from concatenation and multispecies coalescent approaches. Extensive historic introgression was detected across six species-pairs. Potential endemism in the Virgin and Little Colorado Rivers was also apparent, and the former genus Pantosteus was derived as monophyletic, save for C. columbianus. Conclusions: Complex reticulated histories detected herein support the hypothesis that introgression was responsible for conflicts that occurred within the mitochondrial phylogeny, and explains discrepancies found between it and previous morphological phylogenies. Additionally, the hybrid origin of C. columbianus was refuted, but with the caveat that more fine-grain sampling is still needed. Our diverse phylogenomic approaches provided largely concordant results, with naive binning useful in exploring the single conflict. Considerable diversity was found within Catostomus across southwestern North America, with two drainages [Virgin River (UT) and Little Colorado River (AZ)] reflecting unique composition.	2018	10.1186/s12862-018-1197-y		Fish	Cypriniformes	Catostomus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	RAxML, MRBAYES, ExaML, PUAP,  Patterson's D,  D Foil	RAD (14007 loci/179811 snps)	TRUE	
Ravinet, Mark; Yoshida, Kohta; Shigenobu, Shuji; Toyoda, Atsushi; Fujiyama, Asao; Kitano, Jun	The genomic landscape at a late stage of stickleback speciation: High genomic divergence interspersed by small localized regions of introgression	PLOS GENETICS	Speciation is a continuous process and analysis of species pairs at different stages of divergence provides insight into how it unfolds. Previous genomic studies on young species pairs have revealed peaks of divergence and heterogeneous genomic differentiation. Yet less known is how localised peaks of differentiation progress to genome-wide divergence during the later stages of speciation in the presence of persistent gene flow. Spanning the speciation continuum, stickleback species pairs are ideal for investigating how genomic divergence builds up during speciation. However, attention has largely focused on young postglacial species pairs, with little knowledge of the genomic signatures of divergence and introgression in older stickleback systems. The Japanese stickleback species pair, composed of the Pacific Ocean three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the Japan Sea stickleback (G. nipponicus), which co-occur in the Japanese islands, is at a late stage of speciation. Divergence likely started well before the end of the last glacial period and crosses between Japan Sea females and Pacific Ocean males result in hybrid male sterility. Here we use coalescent analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation to show that the two species split approximately 0.68-1 million years ago but that they have continued to exchange genes at a low rate throughout divergence. Population genomic data revealed that, despite gene flow, a high level of genomic differentiation is maintained across the majority of the genome. However, we identified multiple, small regions of introgression, occurring mainly in areas of low recombination rate. Our results demonstrate that a high level of genome-wide divergence can establish in the face of persistent introgression and that gene flow can be localized to small genomic regions at the later stages of speciation with gene flow.	2018	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007358		Fish	Gasterosteiformes	Gasterosteus	TRUE	FALSE	d stats, trees, demographic methods	TRUE	BEAST, RAxML, PSMC, Fst, dXY, Gmin, fd, STRUCTURE,  Patterson's D, D Foil	mtDNA, WGS, RAD	TRUE

Schumer, Molly; Cui, Rongfeng; Boussau, Bastien; Walter, Ronald; Rosenthal, Gil; Andolfatto, Peter	AN EVALUATION OF THE HYBRID SPECIATION HYPOTHESIS FOR XIPHOPHORUS CLEMENCIAE BASED ON WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCES	EVOLUTION	Once thought rare in animal taxa, hybridization has been increasingly recognized as an important and common force in animal evolution. In the past decade, a number of studies have suggested that hybridization has driven speciation in some animal groups. We investigate the signature of hybridization in the genome of a putative hybrid species, Xiphophorus clemenciae, through whole genome sequencing of this species and its hypothesized progenitors. Based on analysis of this data, we find that X. clemenciae is unlikely to have been derived from admixture between its proposed parental species. However, we find significant evidence for recent gene flow between Xiphophorus species. Although we detect genetic exchange in two pairs of species analyzed, the proportion of genomic regions that can be attributed to hybrid origin is small, suggesting that strong behavioral premating isolation prevents frequent hybridization in Xiphophorus. The direction of gene flow between species is potentially consistent with a role for sexual selection in mediating hybridization.	2013	10.1111/evo.12009		Fish	Cyprinodontiformes	Xiphophorus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	HMM-based approach (AU test), Patterson's D, msHOT	WGS	TRUE

Speciation history of European (Anguilla anguilla) and American eel (A. rostrata), analysed using genomic data	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Speciation in the ocean could differ from terrestrial environments due to fewer barriers to gene flow. Hence, sympatric speciation might be common, with American and European eel being candidates for exemplifying this. They show disjunct continental distributions on both sides of the Atlantic, but spawn in overlapping regions of the Sargasso Sea from where juveniles are advected to North American, European and North African coasts. Hybridization and introgression are known to occur, with hybrids almost exclusively observed in Iceland. Different speciation scenarios have been suggested, involving either vicariance or sympatric ecological speciation. Using RAD sequencing and whole-genome sequencing data from parental species and F1 hybrids, we analysed speciation history based on the joint allele frequency spectrum (JAFS) and pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) plots. JAFS supported a model involving a split without gene flow 150,000-160,000 generations ago, followed by secondary contact 87,000-92,000 generations ago, with 64% of the genome experiencing restricted gene flow. This supports vicariance rather than sympatric speciation, likely associated with Pleistocene glaciation cycles and ocean current changes. Whole-genome PSMC analysis of F1 hybrids from Iceland suggested divergence 200,000 generations ago and indicated subsequent gene flow rather than strict isolation. Finally, simulations showed that results from both approaches (JAFS and PSMC) were congruent. Hence, there is strong evidence against sympatric speciation in North Atlantic eels. These results reiterate the need for careful consideration of cases of possible sympatric speciation, as even in seemingly barrier-free oceanic environments palaeoceanographic factors may have promoted vicariance and allopatric speciation.	2020	10.1111/mec.15342		Fish	Anguilliformes	Anguilla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	dadi, PSMC	RAD (9481 snps), WGS	TRUE	
Meier, Joana I.; Sousa, Vitor C.; Marques, David A.; Selz, Oliver M.; Wagner, Catherine E.; Excoffier, Laurent; Seehausen, Ole	Demographic modelling with whole-genome data reveals parallel origin of similar Pundamilia cichlid species after hybridization	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Modes and mechanisms of speciation are best studied in young species pairs. In older taxa, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish what happened during speciation from what happened after speciation. Lake Victoria cichlids in the genus Pundamilia encompass a complex of young species and polymorphic populations. One Pundamilia species pair, P. pundamilia and P. nyererei, is particularly well suited to study speciation because sympatric population pairs occur with different levels of phenotypic differentiation and reproductive isolation at different rocky islands within the lake. Genetic distances between allopatric island populations of the same nominal species often exceed those between the sympatric species. It thus remained unresolved whether speciation into P. nyererei and P. pundamilia occurred once, followed by geographical range expansion and interspecific gene flow in local sympatry, or if the species pair arose repeatedly by parallel speciation. Here, we use genomic data and demographic modelling to test these alternative evolutionary scenarios. We demonstrate that gene flow plays a strong role in shaping the observed patterns of genetic similarity, including both gene flow between sympatric species and gene flow between allopatric populations, as well as recent and early gene flow. The best supported model for the origin of P. pundamilia and P. nyererei population pairs at two different islands is one where speciation happened twice, whereby the second speciation event follows shortly after introgression from an allopatric P. nyererei population that arose earlier. Our findings support the hypothesis that very similar species may arise repeatedly, potentially facilitated by introgressed genetic variation.	2017	10.1111/mec.13838		Fish	Cichliformes	Pundamillia	TRUE	TRUE	Demographic models	TRUE	Fst, PCA, STRUCTURE, FASTSIMCOAL	RAD (21090 snps), WGS (433893 snps)	TRUE

Richards, Emilie J.; Martin, Christopher H.	Adaptive introgression from distant Caribbean islands contributed to the diversification of a microendemic adaptive radiation of trophic specialist pupfishes	PLOS GENETICS	Rapid diversification often involves complex histories of gene flow that leave variable and conflicting signatures of evolutionary relatedness across the genome. Identifying the extent and source of variation in these evolutionary relationships can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms involved in rapid radiations. Here we compare the discordant evolutionary relationships associated with species phenotypes across 42 whole genomes from a sympatric adaptive radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas and several outgroup pupfish species in order to understand the rarity of these trophic specialists within the larger radiation of Cyprinodon. 82% of the genome depicts close evolutionary relationships among the San Salvador Island species reflecting their geographic proximity, but the vast majority of variants fixed between specialist species lie in regions with discordant topologies. Top candidate adaptive introgression regions include signatures of selective sweeps and adaptive introgression of genetic variation from a single population in the northwestern Bahamas into each of the specialist species. Hard selective sweeps of genetic variation on San Salvador Island contributed 5 times more to speciation of trophic specialists than adaptive introgression of Caribbean genetic variation; however, four of the 11 introgressed regions came from a single distant island and were associated with the primary axis of oral jaw divergence within the radiation. For example, standing variation in a proto-oncogene (ski) known to have effects on jaw size introgressed into one San Salvador Island specialist from an island 300 km away approximately 10 kya. The complex emerging picture of the origins of adaptive radiation on San Salvador Island indicates that multiple sources of genetic variation contributed to the adaptive phenotypes of novel trophic specialists on the island. Our findings suggest that a suite of factors, including rare adaptive introgression, may be necessary for adaptive radiation in addition to ecological opportunity.	2017	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006919		Fish	Cyprinodontiformes	Cyprinodon	TRUE	TRUE	F4 only in figs	TRUE	f4, D, treemix, saguaro	WGS (16000000 loci)	TRUE	
Svardal, Hannes; Quah, Fu Xiang; Malinsky, Milan; Ngatunga, Benjamin P.; Miska, Eric A.; Salzburger, Walter; Genner, Martin J.; Turner, George F.; Durbin, Richard	Ancestral Hybridization Facilitated Species Diversification in the Lake Malawi Cichlid Fish Adaptive Radiation	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in East African Lake Malawi encompasses over 500 species that are believed to have evolved within the last 800,000 years from a common founder population. It has been proposed that hybridization between ancestral lineages can provide the genetic raw material to fuel such exceptionally high diversification rates, and evidence for this has recently been presented for the Lake Victoria region cichlid superflock. Here, we report that Lake Malawi cichlid genomes also show evidence of hybridization between two lineages that split 3-4 Ma, today represented by Lake Victoria cichlids and the riverine Astatotilapia sp. "ruaha blue." The two ancestries inMalawi cichlid genomes are present in large blocks of several kilobases, but there is little variation in this pattern between Malawi cichlid species, suggesting that the large-scale mosaic structure of the genomes was largely established prior to the radiation. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of polymorphic variants apparently derived from the hybridization are interspersed in the genomes. These loci show a striking excess of differentiation across ecological subgroups in the LakeMalawi cichlid assemblage, and parental alleles sort differentially into benthic and pelagicMalawi cichlid lineages, consistent with strong differential selection on these loci during species divergence. Furthermore, these loci are enriched for genes involved in immune response and vision, including opsin genes previously identified as important for speciation. Our results reinforce the role of ancestral hybridization in explosive diversification by demonstrating its significance in one of the largest recent vertebrate adaptive radiations.	2020	10.1093/molbev/msz294		Fish	Cichliformes	16	TRUE	TRUE	only f4 stats given	TRUE	f4,D stats, gene trees	WGS (19000000 loci)	TRUE	
Richards, Emilie J.; Poelstra, Jelmer W.; Martin, Christopher H.	Don't throw out the sympatric speciation with the crater lake water: fine-scale investigation of introgression provides equivocal support for causal role of secondary gene flow in one of the clearest examples of sympatric speciation	EVOLUTION LETTERS	Genomic data has revealed complex histories of colonization and repeated gene flow previously unrecognized in some of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation and radiation. However, much of the evidence for secondary gene flow into these radiations comes from summary statistics calculated from sparse genomic sampling without knowledge of which specific genomic regions introgressed. This tells us little about how gene flow potentially influenced sympatric diversification. Here, we investigated whole genomes of Barombi Mbo crater lake cichlids for fine-scale patterns of introgression with neighboring riverine cichlid populations. We found evidence of secondary gene flow into the radiation scattered across <0.24% of the genome; however, from our analyses, it is not clear if the functional diversity in these regions contributed to the ecological, sexual, and morphological diversity found in the lake. Unlike similar studies, we found no obvious candidate genes for adaptive introgression and we cannot rule out that secondary gene flow was predominantly neutral with respect to the diversification process. We also found evidence for differential assortment of ancestral polymorphisms found in riverine populations between sympatric sister species, suggesting the presence of an ancestral hybrid swarm. Although the history of gene flow and colonization is more complicated than previously assumed, the lack of compelling evidence for secondary gene flow's role in species diversification suggests that we should not yet rule out one of the most celebrated examples of sympatric speciation in nature without a more thorough investigation of the timing and functional role of each introgressed region.	2018	10.1002/evl3.78		Fish	Cichliformes	5	TRUE	FALSE	f-d only given in figs	TRUE	saguaro, f4, treemix, fD	WGS ()	TRUE	
Kwan, Ye-Seul; Ko, Myeong-Hun; Jeon, Yeon-Seon; Kim, Hyo-Jin; Won, Yong-Jin	Bidirectional mitochondrial introgression between Korean cobitid fish mediated by hybridogenetic hybrids	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Genomic introgression through interspecific hybridization has been observed in some species of the freshwater fish family Cobitidae. Within this family, a Cobitis hankugensis-Iksookimia longicorpa diploid-triploid hybrid species complex on the Korean peninsula is unique in displaying hybridogenesis, a unisexual reproduction mode that allows hybrids to mediate the transfer of mitochondrial DNA (but not nuclear DNA) between the two parent species. However, populations of the parental species in the wild have never been examined for the potential effect of introgression on their genomes. To address the genetic consequences of unisexual hybridization on the parental species, we examined genetic structure of the two parental species, C.hankugensis and I.longicorpa, in three independent natural habitats where they coexist with their hybrid complex using DNA sequence data of one mitochondrial gene and three nuclear genes. We found that mitochondrial introgression between the two species was extensive in all the examined localities, while there was no evidence of nuclear introgression across the species boundary. This result indicates that the hybridogenetic individuals mediate mitochondrial introgression from one species to the other, producing mito-nuclear mosaic genomes such as C.hankugensis nuclear genomes associated with I.longicorpa mitochondrial DNA and the reverse. The direction and degree of introgression varied among the three localities, but the underlying mechanisms for this observation proved elusive. Introgression might depend on which species serves as the predominant sperm or ovum donor or the environmental conditions of the localities. The present study suggests that introgressive hybridization between pure C.hankugensis and I.longicorpa species is highly likely where the two species co-occur with hybridogenetic individuals, but the consequence of introgression could be variable due to the history and environmental characteristics of particular populations across the parental species' ranges.	2019	10.1002/ece3.4830		Fish	Cypriniformes	Cobitis	TRUE	TRUE	Introgression determined by Fst	TRUE	fst, trees	Sanger (4 loci)	TRUE	
Bossu, Christen M.; Near, Thomas J.	Gene Trees Reveal Repeated Instances of Mitochondrial DNA Introgression in Orangethroat Darters (Percidae: Etheostoma)	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	Phylogenies of closely related animal species are often inferred using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene sequences. The accuracy of mtDNA gene trees is compromised through hybridization that leads to introgression of mitochondrial genomes. Using DNA sequences from 6 single-copy nuclear genes and 2 regions of the mitochondrial genome, we investigated the temporal and geographic signature of mitochondrial and nuclear introgression in the Etheostoma spectabile darter clade. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear genes result in the monophyly of the E. spectabile clade; however, with respect to sampled specimens of 5 species (Etheostoma fragi, Etheostoma uniporum, Etheostoma pulchellum, Etheostoma burri, and E. spectabile), the mitochondrial phylogeny is inconsistent with E. spectabile clade monophyly. Etheostoma uniporum and E. fragi are both fixed for heterospecific mitochondrial genomes. Limited nuclear introgression is restricted to E. uniporum. Our analyses show that the pattern of introgression is consistently asymmetric, with movement of heterospecific mitochondrial haplotypes and nuclear alleles into E. spectabile clade species; introgressive hybridization spans broad temporal scales; and introgression is restricted to species and populations in the Ozarks. The introgressed mitochondrial genome observed in E. fragi has an obscure phylogenetic placement among darters, an ancient age, and is possibly a mitochondrial fossil from an Etheostoma species that has subsequently gone extinct. These results indicate that introgression, both ancient and more contemporaneous, characterizes the history of diversification in the E. spectabile species clade and may be relatively common among clades comprising the species-rich North American freshwater fauna.	2009	10.1093/sysbio/syp014		Fish	Perciformes	Etheostoma	TRUE	TRUE	gene trees	TRUE	gene trees	Sanger (4 loci)	TRUE

In this study, a combined genetic (mitochondrial cyt b and nuclear ITS1 DNA markers) and morphometric approach was applied to five populations from the whole range of A. albidus. Data were compared with those for the alborella A. arborella, an introduced species native to northern Italy. The results indicate a dramatic threat to A. albidus, as 39% of the specimens examined are the result of hybridization with other introduced cyprinids, mainly A. arborella. Hybrid individuals suggest bi-directional hybridization, but introgressed individuals exclusively show A. albidus nuclear genomes and A. arborella mitochondrial haplotypes. Morphological data discriminate the two parental Alburnus but not their hybrids or introgressed individuals. Genetic variability between the species is greater than the morphological variability. Ofanto River shows the most compromised situation suggesting the occurrence of multiple introductions, while Agri and Trigno populations are the most conserved, and deserve priority conservation actions. Given this, an update of the conservation status is recommended.	2016	10.1007/s10750-015-2566-9		Fish	Cypriniformes	Alburnus	TRUE	TRUE	mt/nuc discordance	TRUE	Fst, PCA, MRMODELTEST, MRBAYES, PCoA, morphological data	mtDNA (2 genes), RFLP (1 gene)	TRUE

Stemshorn, Kathryn C.; Reed, Floyd A.; Nolte, Arne W.; Tautz, Diethard	Rapid formation of distinct hybrid lineages after secondary contact of two fish species (Cottus sp.)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Homoploid hybridization after secondary contact between related species can lead to mixtures of genotypes which have the potential for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. Here, we focus on a case where anthropogenic changes within the past 200 years have allowed the hybridization between two fish species (Cottus rhenanus and Cottus perifretum) in the Netherlands. Specifically, we address the question of the dynamics of the emergence of these hybrids and invasion of the river systems. Using a set of 81 mostly ancestry-informative SNP markers, as well as broad sample coverage in and around the area of the initial contact, we find a structured hybrid swarm with at least three distinct hybrid lineages that have emerged out of this secondary contact situation. We show that genetically coherent groups can occur at geographically distant locations, while geographically adjacent groups can be genetically different, indicating that some form of reproductive isolation between the lineages is already effective. Using a newly developed modelling approach, we test the relative influence of founding admixture, drift and migration on the allele compositions of the sampling sites. We find that the allele frequency distributions can best be explained if continued gene flow between the parental species and the hybrid lineages is invoked. Genome mapping of the invasive lineage in the Rhine shows that major chromosomal rearrangements were not involved in creating this distinct lineage. Our results show that hybridization after secondary contact can quickly lead to multiple independent new lineages that have the capacity to form hybrid species.	2011	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04997.x		Fish	Scorpaeniformes	Cottus	TRUE	TRUE	No quantitative stats	TRUE	PHYLIP, PCA	microsattelites (81 loci)	TRUE	
McDonald, David B.; Parchman, Thomas L.; Bower, Michael R.; Hubert, Wayne A.; Rahel, Frank J.	An introduced and a native vertebrate hybridize to form a genetic bridge to a second native species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	The genetic impacts of hybridization between native and introduced species are of considerable conservation concern, while the possibility of reticulate evolution affects our basic understanding of how species arise and shapes how we use genetic data to understand evolutionary diversification. By using mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) sequences and 467 amplified fragment-length polymorphism nuclear DNA markers, we show that the introduced white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) has hybridized with two species native to the Colorado River Basin-the flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) and the bluehead sucker (Catostomus discobolus). Hybrids between the flannelmouth sucker and white sucker have facilitated introgression between the two native species, previously isolated by reproductive barriers, such that individuals exist with contributions from all three genomes. Most hybrids had the mitochondrial haplotype of the introduced white sucker, emphasizing its pivotal role in this three-way hybridization. Our findings highlight how introduced species can threaten the genetic integrity of not only one species but also multiple previously reproductively isolated species. Furthermore, this complex three-way reticulate (as opposed to strictly bifurcating) evolution suggests that seeking examples in other vertebrate systems might be productive. Although the present study involved an introduced species, similar patterns of hybridization could result from natural processes, including stream capture or geological formations (e.g., the Bering land bridge).	2008	10.1073/pnas.0712002105		Fish	Cypriniformes	Catostomus	TRUE	TRUE	gene trees	TRUE	Fst, Nei's D, PHYLIP, MRBAYES, PUAP, STRUCTURE	AFLP (467 loci)	TRUE

Intrinsic reproductive isolation is often emphasized in the former and local adaptation in the latter, although both reduce gene flow between groups. Rarely are these two patterns of spatial distribution reported in the same study system. Here, we report that the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus is subdivided into discrete panmictic entities by both types of hybrid zones. Along the European Atlantic coasts, a northern and a southern lineage meet in the southwest of France where they coexist in sympatryi.e., in the same geographical zonewith little hybridization. In the Mediterranean Sea, two lineages have a mosaic distribution, associated with lagoon-like and marine habitats. A fifth lineage was identified in the Black Sea. Genetic homogeneity over large spatial scales contrasts with isolation maintained in sympatry or close parapatry at a fine scale. A high variation in locus-specific introgression rates provides additional evidence that partial reproductive isolation must be maintaining the divergence. We find that fixed differences between lagoon and marine populations in the Mediterranean Sea belong to the most differentiated SNPs between the two Atlantic lineages, against the genome-wide pattern of structure that mostly follow geography. These parallel outlier SNPs cluster on a single chromosome-wide island of differentiation. Since Atlantic lineages do not map to lagoon-sea habitat variation, genetic parallelism at the genomic island suggests a shared genetic barrier contributes to reproductive isolation in contrasting contexts-i.e., spatial versus ecological. We discuss how a genomic hotspot of parallel differentiation could have evolved and become associated both with space and with a patchy environment in a single study system.	2019	10.1111/evo.13696		Fish	Syngnathiformes	Hippocampus	TRUE	TRUE	detected introgression, not calculated it	TRUE	sequence similarity, Fis, PCA, STRUCTURE, Fst, TREEMIX	WGS	TRUE

Introgressive hybridization and species turnover in reservoirs: a case study involving endemic and invasive basses (Centrarchidae: Micropterus) in southeastern North America	CONSERVATION GENETICS	Invasive species threaten native taxa with extirpation and extinction via several biological mechanisms. One such mechanism, hybridization and subsequent introgression of invasive alleles into native genomes is a serious concern, especially for taxa displaying weak reproductive barriers, as is the case for black basses. Black basses introduced outside of their native ranges thus pose elevated threats to endemic congeners, particularly in the southern United States where restricted ranges preclude refuge from introgression. The recently delineated Bartram's bass (M. sp. cf M. coosae) is endemic to the upper regions of the Savannah River basin, throughout which anthropogenic modification, including impoundment, has been extensive. Non-native Alabama bass (M. henshalli) and smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu) have been introduced into this system on multiple occasions and now threaten Bartram's bass via introgression. In this study we sampled four reservoirs (Jocassee, Keowee, Hartwell, and Russell) in the upper Savannah River during 2004 and 2010. Results from three codominant nuclear loci and one mitochondrial locus revealed extensive introgression between Alabama and Bartram's bass. Results show that Alabama bass have replaced Bartram's bass in lakes Keowee and Russell, where they were first introduced, while the frequencies of hybrids in lakes Jocassee and Hartwell are increasing. Hybridization involving Bartram's bass with native largemouth bass and introduced smallmouth bass was detected in very low frequencies. Results highlight the importance of continual study over geographic and temporal scales to inform management and conservation of rare fishes threatened with extinction via interspecific hybridization.	2018	10.1007/s10592-017-1018-7		Fish	Perciformes	Micropterus	TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid scores at 3 loci	TRUE	RAxML, hybrid index, Fst, sequence similairty	mtDNA (1 gene), Amplicon (3 loci)	TRUE	
Harrison, Hugo B.; Berumen, Michael L.; Saenz-Agudelo, Pablo; Salas, Eva; Williamson, David H.; Jones, Geoffrey P.	Widespread hybridization and bidirectional introgression in sympatric species of coral reef fish	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems, where numerous closely related species often coexist. How new species arise and are maintained in these high geneflow environments have been long-standing conundrums. Hybridization and patterns of introgression between sympatric species provide a unique insight into the mechanisms of speciation and the maintenance of species boundaries. In this study, we investigate the extent of hybridization between two closely related species of coral reef fish: the common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and the bar-cheek coral trout (Plectropomus maculatus). Using a complementary set of 25 microsatellite loci, we distinguish pure genotype classes from first- and later-generation hybrids, identifying 124 interspecific hybrids from a collection of 2,991 coral trout sampled in inshore and mid-shelf reefs of the southern Great Barrier Reef. Hybrids were ubiquitous among reefs, fertile and spanned multiple generations suggesting both ecological and evolutionary processes are acting to maintain species barriers. We elaborate on these finding to investigate the extent of genomic introgression and admixture from 2,271 SNP loci recovered from a ddRAD library of pure and hybrid individuals. An analysis of genomic clines on recovered loci indicates that 261 SNP loci deviate from a model of neutral introgression, of which 132 indicate a pattern of introgression consistent with selection favouring both hybrid and parental genotypes. Our findings indicate genome-wide, bidirectional introgression between two sympatric species of coral reef fishes and provide further support to a growing body of evidence for the role of hybridization in the evolution of coral reef fishes.	2017	10.1111/mec.14279		Fish	Perciformes	Plectropomus	TRUE	TRUE	Identifies hybrids	TRUE	microsat, sequences similarity, newhybrids	RAD (2271 loci)	TRUE	
Castillo, Ana G.

One of the risks is increased interspecific hybridization by interspecific matings. Stocking of domesticated genomes into wild ecosystems leads to a heightened frequency of interspecific hybridization in sympatric south European Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta. Introgressive hybridization involving brown trout males of domestic origin was demonstrated. Following cessation of domestic stock releases in eight south European rivers, hybridization decreased significantly. These results emphasize the risks associated with stock transfers and escapes of domestic individuals in wild ecosystems and illustrate the potential role of domestic stocks when they contribute to secondary contact between species.

Metcalf, Jessica L.; Siegle, Matthew R.; Martin, Andrew P.	Hybridization dynamics between Colorado's native cutthroat trout and introduced rainbow trout	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	Newly formed hybrid populations provide an opportunity to examine the initial consequences of secondary contact between species and identify genetic patterns that may be important early in the evolution of hybrid inviability. Widespread introductions of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) into watersheds with native cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) have resulted in hybridization. These introductions have contributed to the decline of native cutthroat trout populations. Here, we examine the pattern of hybridization between introduced rainbow trout and 2 populations of cutthroat trout native to Colorado. For this study, we utilized 7 diagnostic, codominant nuclear markers and a diagnostic mitochondrial marker to investigate hybridization in a population of greenback cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias) and a population of Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus). We infer that cutthroat-rainbow trout hybrid swarms have formed in both populations. Although a mixture of hybrid genotypes was present, not all genotype combinations were detected at expected frequencies. We found evidence that mitochondrial DNA introgression in hybrids is asymmetric and more likely from rainbow trout than from cutthroat trout. A difference in spawning time of the 2 species or differences in the fitness between the reciprocal crosses may explain the asymmetry. Additionally, the presence of intraspecific cytonuclear associations found in both populations is concordant with current hypotheses regarding coevolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.	2008	10.1093/jhered/esm118		Fish	Salmoniformes	Onchorhyncus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	microsattelites (8 loci)	TRUE	
Mee, J. A.; Taylor, E. B.	The cybrid invasion: widespread postglacial dispersal by Phoxinus (Pisces: Cyprinidae) cytoplasmic hybrids	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE	Peculiar reproductive processes that arise during sperm-dependent asexual reproduction may have important roles in allowing coexistence of sperm-dependent asexuals and their sexually reproducing hosts. Though typically clonal, nonclonal reproduction in the hybrid gynogenetic species Phoxinus eos-neogaeus can reestablish sexual northern redbelly dace (Phoxinus eos (Cope, 1861)) nuclear genomes. These hybrid-derived P. eos biotypes, known as cybrids, have finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus Cope, 1867) mitochondria but are otherwise indistinguishable from "pure" P. eos. Our goal was to determine the extent of the cybrids' distribution, and hence to evaluate their role in mechanisms of asexual-sexual coexistence. We also set out to determine the geographic origins of P. eos neogaeus and cybrids. Our sampling revealed that all Phoxinus species and biotypes are widely distributed in North America, but that cybrids have replaced pure P. eos, or preempted postglacial colonization by pure P. eos, in the northern portion of their distribution. Also, all P. eos-neogaeus and cybrids had mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences closely related to a lineage originating from a Mississippi glacial refugium. No P. eos-neogaeus or cybrids were derived from a divergent P. neogaeus lineage discovered in Atlantic Canada. It is therefore unlikely that P. eos-neogaeus or cybrids originated in any Atlantic glacial refugia. If P. neogaeus mitochondria are better adapted to northern environments, widespread mtDNA introgression may facilitate coexistence in northern areas by reducing the disparity in fitness between P eos neogaeus and its sexual hosts.	2012	10.1139/Z2012-023		Fish	Cypriniformes	Phoxinus	TRUE	TRUE	mitochondrial hybrid detection	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Balakirev, Evgeniy S.; Romanov, Nikolai S.; Mikheev, Pavel B.; Ayala, Francisco J.	Mitochondrial DNA Variation and Introgression in Siberian Taimen Hucho taimen	PLOS ONE	Siberian taimen Hucho taimen is the largest representative of the family Salmonidae inhabiting rivers of northern Eurasia. The species is under intensive aquaculture activity. To monitor natural taimen populations we have sequenced a portion (8,141 bp) of the mitochondrial (mt) genome in 28 specimens of H. taimen from six localities in the Amur River basin. Nucleotide variability is low (pi = 0.0010), but structured in two divergent haplotype groups. A comparison of the data with the GenBank H. taimen mt genome (HQ897271) reveals significant differences between them in spite of the fact that the fish specimens come from neighboring geographical areas. The distribution of divergence is non-uniform with two highly pronounced divergent regions centered on two genes, ND3 and ND6. To clarify the pattern of divergence we sequenced the corresponding portion of the mt genome of lenok Brachymystax tumensis and analyzed the GenBank complete mt genomes of related species. We have found that the first and second divergent regions are identical between the GenBank H. taimen and two lenok subspecies, B. lenok and B. lenok tsinlingensis, respectively. Consequently, both divergent regions represent introgressed mtDNA resulting from intergeneric hybridization between the two lenok subspecies and H. taimen. Introgression is, however, not detected in our specimens. This plus the precise identity of the introgressed fragments between the donor and the recipient GenBank sequence suggests that the introgression is local and very recent, probably due to artificial manipulations involving taimen -lenok intergeneric hybridization. Human-mediated hybridization may become a major threat to aquatic biodiversity. Consequently we suggest that due attention needs to be given to this threat by means of responsible breeding program management, so as to prevent a potential spread of hybrid fishes that could jeopardize the resilience of locally adapted gene pools of the native H. taimen populations.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0071147		Fish	Salmoniformes	Hucho	TRUE	TRUE	No stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (32 loci)	TRUE	
Walters, David M.; Blum, Mike J.; Rashleigh, Brenda; Freeman, Byron J.; Porter, Brady A.; Burkhead, Noel M.	Red shiner invasion and hybridization with blacktail shiner in the upper Coosa River, USA	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS	Human disturbance increases the invasibility of lotic ecosystems and the likelihood of hybridization between invasive and native species. We investigated whether disturbance contributed to the invasion of red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) and their hybridization with native blacktail shiner (C. venusta stigmatura) in the Upper Coosa River System (UCRS). Historical records indicated that red shiners and hybrids rapidly dispersed in the UCRS via large, mainstem rivers since the mid to late 1990s. We measured the occurrence and abundance of parental species and hybrids near tributary-mainstem confluences and characterized populations at these incipient contact zones by examining variation across morphological traits and molecular markers. Red shiners represented only 1.2% of total catch in tributaries yet introgression was widespread with hybrids accounting for 34% of total catch. Occurrence of red shiners and hybrids was highly correlated with occurrence of blacktail shiners, indicating that streams with native populations are preferentially colonized early in the invasion and that hybridization is a key process in the establishment of red shiners and their genome in new habitats. Tributary invasion was driven by post-F1 hybrids with proportionately greater genomic contributions from blacktail shiner. Occurrence of red shiners and hybrids and the relative abundance of hybrids significantly increased with measures of human disturbance including turbidity, catchment agricultural land use, and low dissolved oxygen concentration. Red shiners are a significant threat to Southeast Cyprinella diversity, given that 41% of these species hybridize with red shiner, that five southeastern drainages are invaded, and that these drainages are increasingly disturbed by urbanization.	2008	10.1007/s10530-007-9198-6		Fish	Cypriniformes	Cyprinella	TRUE	TRUE	microsats	TRUE	newhybrids, sequence similarity	RFLP, microsattelites (8 loci)	TRUE

Surgeons and suture zones: Hybridization among four surgeonfish species in the Indo-Pacific with variable evolutionary outcomes	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Closely related species can provide valuable insights into evolutionary processes through comparison of their ecology, geographic distribution and the history recorded in their genomes. In the Indo-Pacific, many reef fishes are divided into sister species that come into secondary contact at biogeographic borders, most prominently where Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean faunas meet. It is unclear whether hybridization in this contact zone represents incomplete speciation, secondary contact, an evolutionary dead-end (for hybrids) or some combination of the above. To address these issues, we conducted comprehensive surveys of two widely-distributed surgeonfish species, Acanthurus leucosternon (N = 141) and A. nigricans (N = 412), with mtDNA cytochrome b sequences and ten microsatellite loci. These surgeon fishes are found primarily in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, respectively, but overlap at the Christmas and Cocos-Keeling Islands hybrid zone in the eastern Indian Ocean. We also sampled the two other Pacific members of this species complex, A. achilles (N = 54) and A. japonicas (N = 49), which are known to hybridize with A. nigricans where their ranges overlap. Our results indicate separation between the four species that range from the recent Pleistocene to late Pliocene (235,000-2.25 million years ago). The Pacific A. achilles is the most divergent (and possibly ancestral) species with mtDNA d(corr) approximate to 0.04, whereas the other two Pacific species (A. japonicas and A. nigricans) are distinguishable only at a population or subspecies level (Phi(ST) = 0.6533, P < 0.001). Little population structure was observed within species, with evidence of recent population expansion across all four geographic ranges. We detected sharing of mtDNA haplotypes between species and extensive hybridization based on microsatellites, consistent with later generation hybrids but also the effects of allele homoplasy. Despite extensive introgression, 98% of specimens had concordance between mtDNA lineage and species identification based on external morphology, indicating that species integrity may not be eroding. The A. nigricans complex demonstrates a range of outcomes from incomplete speciation to secondary contact to decreasing hybridization with increasing evolutionary depth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A primer set of ManDra distinguished two genetically different groups (A and B) of M. anguillicaudatus by specific electrophoretograms. A primer set of ManBgl amplified the DNA of M. anguillicaudatus and M. mizolepis. The individuals of M. anguillicaudatus were divided into two groups depending on the fragment sizes, in which the groups A and B (B-1 and B-2) showed 400 and 460 bp, respectively. M. mizolepis was distinguished by a different pattern (400-, 460-, and 510-bp fragments). PCR-RFLP analyses of recombination activating gene 1 gave a clear difference between A or B-2 (443-bp fragment) and B-1 groups (296- and 147-bp fragments). Clonal lineages and hybrids between B-1 and B-2 groups could be identified by appearance of three fragments (443, 296, and 147 bp). The combined analyses using the above three nuclear markers discriminated among nuclear genomes of genetic groups (A, B-1 and B-2) of M. anguillicaudatus and M. mizolepis. In several localities, natural hybridizations between the group B-1 and B-2 loaches and introgressions of clonal mitochondrial genomes into the group B-1 loaches were detected.	2017	10.1007/s12562-017-1108-y		Fish	Cypriniformes	Misgurnus	TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid detection	TRUE	sequence similarity	mtDNA	TRUE	
Van Herwerden, L; Doherty, PJ	Contrasting genetic structures across two hybrid zones of a tropical reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus (Bleeker 1855)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Hybrid zones are natural laboratories offering insights into speciation processes. Narrow hybrid zones are less common in the sea than on land consistent with higher dispersal among marine populations. Acanthochromis polyacanthus is an unusual bony marine fish with philopatric dispersal that exists as allopatric stocks of white, bicoloured and black fish on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). At two latitudes, different morphs coexist and hybridize at narrow contact zones. Sequence data from mitochondrial Hypervariable Region 1 revealed contrasting patterns of introgression across these zones. At the northern hybrid zone, a single clade of mitochondrial haplotypes was found in all white fish, hybrids and tens of kilometres into pure bicoloured stock. At the southern hybrid zone, there was no introgression of mitochondrial genes into black fish and hybrids shared the bicoloured haplotypes. Based on this asymmetry, we postulate that black fish from the southern GBR have experienced a selective sweep of their mitochondrial genome, which has resulted in almost total reproductive isolation.	2006	10.1111/J.1420-9101.2005.00969.X		Fish	-	Acanthochromis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PUAP, Fst	mtDNA	TRUE	
Bay, Rachael A.; Taylor, Eric B.; Schluter, Dolph	Parallel introgression and selection on introduced alleles in a native species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	As humans cause the redistribution of species ranges, hybridization between previously allopatric species is on the rise. Such hybridization can have complex effects on overall fitness of native species as new allelic combinations are tested. Widespread species introductions provide a unique opportunity to study selection on introgressed alleles in independent, replicated populations. We examined selection on alleles that repeatedly introgressed from introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) into native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) populations in western Canada. We found that the degree of introgression of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms from the invasive species into the native is correlated between independent watersheds. A number of rainbow trout alleles have repeatedly swept to high frequency in native populations, suggesting parallel adaptive advantages. Using simulations, we estimated large selection coefficients up to 0.05 favoring several rainbow trout alleles in the native background. Although previous studies have found reduced hybrid fitness and genome-wide resistance to introgression in westslope cutthroat trout, our results suggest that some introduced genomic regions are strongly favored by selection. Our study demonstrates the utility of replicated introductions as case studies for understanding parallel adaptation and the interactions between selection and introgression across the genome. We suggest that understanding this variation, including consideration of beneficial alleles, can inform management strategies for hybridizing species.	2019	10.1111/mec.15097		Fish	Salmoniformes	Onchorhyncus	TRUE	TRUE	NGSAdmix, but results not directly reported	TRUE	PCA, NGSadmix, sequence similarity	GBS	TRUE	
Hohenlohe, Paul A.; Amish, Stephen J.; Catchen, Julian M.; Allendorf, Fred W.; Luikart, Gordon	Next-generation RAD sequencing identifies thousands of SNPs for assessing hybridization between rainbow and westslope cutthroat trout	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	The increased numbers of genetic markers produced by genomic techniques have the potential to both identify hybrid individuals and localize chromosomal regions responding to selection and contributing to introgression. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing to identify a dense set of candidate SNP loci with fixed allelic differences between introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi). We distinguished candidate SNPs from homeologs (paralogs resulting from whole-genome duplication) by detecting excessively high observed heterozygosity and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions. We identified 2923 candidate species-specific SNPs from a single Illumina sequencing lane containing 24 barcode-labelled individuals. Published sequence data and ongoing genome sequencing of rainbow trout will allow physical mapping of SNP loci for genome-wide scans and will also provide flanking sequence for design of qPCR-based TaqMan (R) assays for high-throughput, low-cost hybrid identification using a subset of 50-100 loci. This study demonstrates that it is now feasible to identify thousands of informative SNPs in nonmodel species quickly and at reasonable cost, even if no prior genomic information is available.	2011	10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02967.x		Fish	Salmoniformes	Onchorhyncus	TRUE	TRUE	Method to identify hybrids	TRUE	sequence similarity	RAD	TRUE

Populations of the ice goby Leucopsarion petersii are distributed throughout the Japanese archipelago and comprise genetically and phenotypically divergent groups in the Japan Sea and the Pacific Ocean. In particular, populations in the Japan Sea have a larger body size and numbers of vertebrae than those in the Pacific Ocean. Herein, we performed integrated analyses of genotypes and phenotypes of two independent secondary contact zones and investigated their consequences. Population genetic analyses revealed asymmetric introgression of the mitochondrial genome of either lineage relative to little admixture of nuclear genomes in both secondary contact zones. On phenotype analyses, vertebral numbers were clearly explained by nuclear genomic ancestry in both secondary contact zones, whereas body size was not, suggesting that a little introgression of nuclear genes regulates body size. Actually, we observed biased introgression of a candidate gene, neuropeptide Y (NPY), which potentially controls body size in the ice goby. Moreover, the body size changes in the introgressed populations possibly affect the introgression patterns of mitochondrial genomes across these zones. Collectively, our results demonstrated that genomic and phenotypic consequences of secondary contact varied in marine variable environments.	2020	10.1038/s41437-019-0239-6		Fish	Gobiiformes	Leucopsarion	TRUE	TRUE	No quantitative metrics given	TRUE	ape, sequence similarity, ADMIXTURE, Fst, morphological data	mtDNA (1 gene), RAD (2262 loci)	TRUE

Individuals with intermediate phenotypes in Lake Ontario and the upper St Lawrence River probably result from secondary contacts between these races.

Rapid advances in genomics now make it feasible to assess locus-specific and genome-wide patterns of natural selection acting on invasive introgression within and among natural populations occupying diverse environments. We quantified genome-wide patterns of admixture across multiple independent hybrid zones of native westslope cutthroat trout and invasive rainbow trout, the world's most widely introduced fish, by genotyping 339 individuals from 21 populations using 9380 species-diagnostic loci. A significantly greater proportion of the genome appeared to be under selection favouring native cutthroat trout (rather than rainbow trout), and this pattern was pervasive across the genome (detected on most chromosomes). Furthermore, selection against invasive alleles was consistent across populations and environments, even in those where rainbow trout were predicted to have a selective advantage (warm environments). These data corroborate field studies showing that hybrids between these species have lower fitness than the native taxa, and show that these fitness differences are due to selection favouring many native genes distributed widely throughout the genome.	2016	10.1098/rspb.2016.1380		Fish	Salmoniformes	Onchorhyncus	TRUE	TRUE	Locus specific analysis	TRUE	sequence similarity	RAD (9380 loci)	TRUE

We examine patterns of interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium (ILD) and the presence of hybridization in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, in previously identified hybrid zones in the North Atlantic. Here, previously identified clinal loci were mapped to the cod genome with most (similar to 70%) occurring in or associated with (<5 kb) coding regions representing a diverse array of possible functions and pathways. Despite the observation that clinal loci were distributed across three linkage groups, elevated ILD was observed among all groups of clinal loci and strongest in comparisons involving a region of low recombination along linkage group 7. Evidence of ILD supports a hypothesis of divergence hitchhiking transitioning to genome hitchhiking consistent with reproductive isolation. This hypothesis is supported by Bayesian characterization of hybrid classes present and we find evidence of common F1 hybrids in several regions consistent with frequent interbreeding, yet little evidence of F2 or backcrossed individuals. This work suggests that significant barriers to hybridization and introgression exist among these co-occurring groups of cod either through strong selection against hybrid individuals, or genetic incompatibility and intrinsic barriers to hybridization. In either case, the presence of strong clinal trends, and little gene flow despite extensive hybridization supports a hypothesis of reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation in Atlantic cod. Further work is required to test the degree and nature of reproductive isolation in this species.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0106380		Fish	Gadiformes	Gadus	TRUE	TRUE	Structure based methods 	TRUE	structure, newhybrids, sequence similarity	microarray (1536 loci)	TRUE	
Dodson, Julian J.; Bourret, Audrey; Barrette, Marie France; Turgeon, Julie; Daigle, Gaetan; Legault, Michel; Lecomte, Frederic	Intraspecific Genetic Admixture and the Morphological Diversification of an Estuarine Fish Population Complex	PLOS ONE	The North-east American Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is composed of two glacial races first identified through the spatial distribution of two distinct mtDNA lineages. Contemporary breeding populations of smelt in the St. Lawrence estuary comprise contrasting mixtures of both lineages, suggesting that the two races came into secondary contact in this estuary. The overall objective of this study was to assess the role of intraspecific genetic admixture in the morphological diversification of the estuarine rainbow smelt population complex. The morphology of mixed-ancestry populations varied as a function of the relative contribution of the two races to estuarine populations, supporting the hypothesis of genetic admixture. Populations comprising both ancestral mtDNA races did not exhibit intermediate morphologies relative to pure populations but rather exhibited many traits that exceeded the parental trait values, consistent with the hypothesis of transgressive segregation. Evidence for genetic admixture at the level of the nuclear gene pool, however, provided only partial support for this hypothesis. Variation at nuclear AFLP markers revealed clear evidence of the two corresponding mtDNA glacial races. The admixture of the two races at the nuclear level is only pronounced in mixed-ancestry populations dominated by one of the mtDNA lineages, the same populations showing the greatest degree of morphological diversification and population structure. In contrast, mixed-ancestry populations dominated by the alternate mtDNA lineage showed little evidence of introgression of the nuclear genome, little morphological diversification and little contemporary population genetic structure. These results only partially support the hypothesis of transgressive segregation and may be the result of the differential effects of natural selection acting on admixed genomes from different sources.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0123172		Fish	Osmeriformes	Osmerus	TRUE	TRUE	Structure based analysis 	TRUE	morphological data, PCA, STRUCTURE, hybrid index, sequence similarity	mtDNA, AFLP	TRUE	
Gante, Hugo F.; Doadrio, Ignacio; Alves, Maria Judite; Dowling, Thomas E.	Semi-permeable species boundaries in Iberian barbels (Barbus and Luciobarbus, Cyprinidae)	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: The evolution of species boundaries and the relative impact of selection and gene flow on genomic divergence are best studied in populations and species pairs exhibiting various levels of divergence along the speciation continuum. We studied species boundaries in Iberian barbels, Barbus and Luciobarbus, a system of populations and species spanning a wide degree of genetic relatedness, as well as geographic distribution and range overlap. We jointly analyze multiple types of molecular markers and morphological traits to gain a comprehensive perspective on the nature of species boundaries in these cyprinid fishes. Results: Intraspecific molecular and morphological differentiation is visible among many populations. Genomes of all sympatric species studied are porous to gene flow, even if they are not sister species. Compared to their allopatric counterparts, sympatric representatives of different species share alleles and show an increase in all measures of nucleotide polymorphism (S, H-d, K, pi and theta). High molecular diversity is particularly striking in L. steindachneri from the Tejo and Guadiana rivers, which co-varies with other sympatric species. Interestingly, different nuclear markers introgress across species boundaries at various levels, with distinct impacts on population trees. As such, some loci exhibit limited introgression and population trees resemble the presumed species tree, while alleles at other loci introgress more freely and population trees reflect geographic affinities and interspecific gene flow. Additionally, extent of introgression decreases with increasing genetic divergence in hybridizing species pairs. Conclusions: We show that reproductive isolation in Iberian Barbus and Luciobarbus is not complete and species boundaries are semi-permeable to (some) gene flow, as different species (including non-sister) are exchanging genes in areas of sympatry. Our results support a speciation-with-gene-flow scenario with heterogeneous barriers to gene flow across the genome, strengthening with genetic divergence. This is consistent with observations coming from other systems and supports the notion that speciation is not instantaneous but a gradual process, during which different species are still able to exchange some genes, while selection prevents gene flow at other loci. We also provide evidence for a hybrid origin of a barbel ecotype, L. steindachneri, suggesting that ecology plays a key role in species coexistence and hybridization in Iberian barbels. This ecotype with intermediate, yet variable, molecular, morphological, trophic and ecological characteristics is the local product of introgressive hybridization of L. comizo with up to three different species (with L. bocagei in the Tejo, with L. microcephalus and L. sclateri in the Guadiana). In spite of the homogenizing effects of ongoing gene flow, species can still be discriminated using a combination of morphological and molecular markers. Iberian barbels are thus an ideal system for the study of species boundaries, since they span a wide range of genetic divergences, with diverse ecologies and degrees of sympatry.	2015	10.1186/s12862-015-0392-3		Fish	Cypriniformes	Barbus, Luciobarbus	TRUE	TRUE	Structure based analysis 	TRUE	PCA, morphological data, JMODELTEST, PHYML, sequence similarity, dXY, Fst, PHYLIP, STRUCTURE	mtDNA (1 gene), Sanger (4 loci)	TRUE	
Hulsey, Christopher Darrin; Bell, Katherine L.; Garcia-de-Leon, Francisco J.; Nice, Chris C.; Meyer, Axel	Do relaxed selection and habitat temperature facilitate biased mitogenomic introgression in a narrowly endemic fish?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Introgression might be exceptionally common during the evolution of narrowly endemic species. For instance, in the springs of the small and isolated Cuatro Cienegas Valley, the mitogenome of the cichlid fish Herichthys cyanoguttatus could be rapidly introgressing into populations of the trophically polymorphic H. minckleyi. We used a combination of genetic and environmental data to examine the factors associated with this mitochondrial introgression. A reduced representation library of over 6220 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the nuclear genome showed that mitochondrial introgression into H. minckleyi is biased relative to the amount of nuclear introgression. SNP assignment probabilities also indicated that cichlids with more hybrid ancestry are not more commonly female providing no support for asymmetric backcrossing or hybrid-induced sex-ratio distortion in generating the bias in mitochondrial introgression. Smaller effective population size in H. minckleyi inferred from the SNPs coupled with sequences of all 13 mitochondrial proteins suggests that relaxed selection on the mitogenome could be facilitating the introgression of "H. cyanoguttatus" haplotypes. Additionally, we showed that springs with colder temperatures had greater amounts of mitochondrial introgression from H. cyanoguttatus. Relaxed selection in H. minckleyi coupled with temperature-related molecular adaptation could be facilitating mitogenomic introgression into H. minckleyi.	2016	10.1002/ece3.2121		Fish	Cichliformes	Herichthys	TRUE	TRUE	Structure based methods	TRUE	ENTROPY, sequence similarity	RAD, mtDNA (13 genes)	TRUE

Assessing patterns of hybridization between North Atlantic eels using diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms	HEREDITY	The two North Atlantic eel species, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), spawn in partial sympatry in the Sargasso Sea, providing ample opportunity to interbreed. In this study, we used a RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) sequencing approach to identify species-specific diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and design a low-density array that combined with screening of a diagnostic mitochondrial DNA marker. Eels from Iceland (N=159) and from the neighboring Faroe Islands (N=29) were genotyped, along with 94 larvae (49 European and 45 American eel) collected in the Sargasso Sea. Our SNP survey showed that the majority of Icelandic eels are pure European eels but there is also an important contribution of individuals of admixed ancestry (10.7%). Although most of the hybrids were identified as F1 hybrids from European eel female x American eel male crosses, backcrosses were also detected, including a first-generation backcross (F1 hybrid x pure European eel) and three individuals identified as second-generation backcrosses originating from American eel x F1 hybrid backcrosses interbreeding with pure European eels. In comparison, no hybrids were observed in the Faroe Islands, the closest bodies of land to Iceland. It is possible that hybrids show an intermediate migratory behaviour between the two parental species that ultimately brings hybrid larvae to the shores of Iceland, situated roughly halfway between the Sargasso Sea and Europe. Only two hybrids were observed among Sargasso Sea larvae, both backcrosses, but no F1 hybrids, that points to temporal variation in the occurrence of hybridization.	2014	10.1038/hdy.2013.145		Fish	Anguilliformes	Anguilla	TRUE	TRUE	Structure based methods 	TRUE	Fst, STRUCTURE, NewHybrids, HYBRIDLAB	RAD (767015), mtDNA (1 gene)	TRUE

Genome-wide single-generation signatures of local selection in the panmictic European eel	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Next-generation sequencing and the collection of genome-wide data allow identifying adaptive variation and footprints of directional selection. Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64(o)N, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using F-ST-based outlier tests and by testing for significant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (F-ST=0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identified. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identified is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the >30 degrees difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene flow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation.	2014	10.1111/mec.12753		Fish	Anguilliformes	Anguilla	TRUE	TRUE	Structure based methods 	TRUE	sequence similarity, Fst, STRUCTURE	RAD (453062 snps), mtDNA (41 snps)	TRUE	
Gante, Hugo F.; Matschiner, Michael; Malmstrom, Martin; Jakobsen, Kjetill S.; Jentoft, Sissel; Salzburger, Walter	Genomics of speciation and introgression in Princess cichlid fishes from Lake Tanganyika	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	How variation in the genome translates into biological diversity and new species originate has endured as the mystery of mysteries in evolutionary biology. African cichlid fishes are prime model systems to address speciation-related questions for their remarkable taxonomic and phenotypic diversity, and the possible role of gene flow in this process. Here, we capitalize on genome sequencing and phylogenomic analyses to address the relative impacts of incomplete lineage sorting, introgression and hybrid speciation in the Neolamprologus savoryi-complex (the 'Princess cichlids') from Lake Tanganyika. We present a time-calibrated species tree based on whole-genome sequences and provide strong evidence for incomplete lineage sorting in the early phases of diversification and multiple introgression events affecting different stages. Importantly, we find that the Neolamprologus chromosomes show centre-to-periphery biases in nucleotide diversity, sequence divergence, GC content, incomplete lineage sorting and rates of introgression, which are likely modulated by recombination density and linked selection. The detection of heterogeneous genomic landscapes has strong implications on the genomic mechanisms involved in speciation. Collinear chromosomal regions can be protected from gene flow and harbour incompatibility genes if they reside in lowly recombining regions, and coupling can evolve between non-physically linked genomic regions (chromosome centres in particular). Simultaneously, higher recombination towards chromosome peripheries makes these more dynamic, evolvable regions where adaptation polymorphisms have a fertile ground. Hence, differences in genome architecture could explain the levels of taxonomic and phenotypic diversity seen in taxa with collinear genomes and might have contributed to the spectacular cichlid diversity observed today.	2016	10.1111/mec.13767		Fish	Cichliformes	Neolamprologus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	SAGUARO, RAxML, Patterson's D, PhyloNet	WGS	TRUE	
Roberge, Christian; Normandeau, Eric; Einum, Sigurd; Guderley, Helga; Bernatchez, Louis	Genetic consequences of interbreeding between farmed and wild Atlantic salmon: insights from the transcriptome	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Large annual escapees of farmed Atlantic salmon enhance the risk of extinction of wild populations through genetic and ecological interactions. Recently, we documented evolutionary change in gene transcription between farmed and wild Atlantic salmon after only five generations of artificial selection. While differences for most quantitative traits are expected to gradually dilute through repeated backcrossing to wild populations, the genetic basis of gene transcription has been shown to be largely nonadditive and hybrid crosses may display unexpected inheritance patterns. This makes it difficult to predict to what extent interbreeding between farmed and wild individuals will change the genetic makeup of wild salmon populations. Here, we compare the genome-wide gene transcription profiles of Norwegian wild salmon to that of a second generation hybrid cross [backcross: (Farmed X Wild) X Wild]. Over 6% (298, q-value < 0.01) of the detected genes exhibited highly significantly different transcription levels, and the range and average magnitude of those differences was strikingly higher than previously described between pure farmed and wild strains. Most differences appear to result from nonadditive gene interactions. These results suggest that interbreeding of fugitive farmed salmon and wild individuals could substantially modify the genetic control of gene transcription in natural populations exposed to high migration from fish farms, resulting in potentially detrimental effects on the survival of these populations. This further supports the idea that measures to considerably reduce the number of escaped farmed salmon and their reproduction in the wild are urgently needed.	2008	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03438.x		Fish	Salmoniformes	Salmo	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	Transciptome	TRUE	
Rougeux, Clement; Bernatchez, Louis; Gagnaire, Pierre-Alexandre	Modeling the Multiple Facets of Speciation-with-Gene-Flow toward Inferring the Divergence History of Lake Whitefish Species Pairs (Coregonus clupeaformis)	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Parallel divergence across replicated species pairs occurring in similar environmental contrasts may arise through distinct evolutionary scenarios. Deciphering whether such parallelism actually reflects repeated parallel divergence driven by divergent selection or a single divergence event with subsequent gene flow needs to be ascertained. Reconstructing historical gene flow is therefore of fundamental interest to understand how demography and selection jointly shaped genomic divergence during speciation. Here, we use an extended modeling framework to explore the multiple facets of speciation-with-gene-flow with demo-genetic divergence models that capture both temporal and genomic variation in effective population size and migration rate. We investigate the divergence history of replicate sympatric species pairs of Lake Whitefish (normal benthic and dwarf limnetic) characterized by variable degrees of ecological divergence and reproductive isolation. Genome-wide SNPs were used to document the extent of genetic differentiation in each species pair, and 26 divergence models were fitted and compared with the unfolded joint allele frequency spectrum of each pair. We found evidence that a recent (circa 3,000-4,000 generations) asymmetrical secondary contact between expanding postglacial populations has accompanied Whitefish diversification. Our results suggest that heterogeneous genomic differentiation has emerged through the combined effects of linked selection generating variable rates of lineage sorting across the genome during geographical isolation, and heterogeneous introgression eroding divergence at different rates across the genome upon secondary contact. This study thus provides a new retrospective insight into the historical demographic and selective processes that shaped a continuum of divergence associated with ecological speciation.	2017	10.1093/gbe/evx150		Fish	Salmoniformes	Coregonus	TRUE	TRUE	Treemix only	TRUE	dadi, dAPC, TREEMIX	RAD (42558 snps)	TRUE	
Angers, Bernard; Leung, Christelle; Vetil, Romain; Deremiens, Leo; Vergilino, Roland	The effects of allospecific mitochondrial genome on the fitness of northern redbelly dace (Chrosomus eos)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Instantaneous mitochondrial introgression events allow the disentangling of the effects of hybridization from those of allospecific mtDNA. Such process frequently occurred in the fish Chrosomus eos, resulting in cybrid individuals composed of a C.eos nuclear genome but with a C.neogaeus mtDNA. This provides a valuable model to address the fundamental question: How well do introgressed individuals perform in their native environment? We infer where de novo production of cybrids occurred to discriminate native environments from those colonized by cybrids in 25 sites from two regions (West-Qc and East-Qc) in Quebec (Canada). We then compared the relative abundance of wild types and cybrids as a measure integrating both fitness and de novo production of cybrids. According to mtDNA variation, 12 introgression events are required to explain the diversity of cybrids. Five cybrid lineages could not be associated with in situ introgression events. This includes one haplotype carried by 93% of the cybrids expected to have colonized West-Qc. These cybrids also displayed a nearly complete allopatric distribution with wild types. We still inferred de novo production of cybrids at seven sites, that accounted for 70% of the cybrids in East-Qc. Wild-type and cybrid individuals coexist in all East-Qc sites while cybrids were less abundant. Allopatry of cybrids restricted to the postglacial expansion suggests the existence of higher fitness for cybrids in specific conditions, allowing for the colonization of different environments and expanding the species' range. However, allospecific mtDNA does not provide a higher fitness to cybrids in their native environment compared to wild types, making the success of an introgressed lineage uncertain.	2018	10.1002/ece3.3922		Fish	Cypriniformes	Chrosomus	TRUE	TRUE	mt trees only	TRUE	sequence similarity, Fst	mtDNA	TRUE	
Leitwein, Maeva; Cayuela, Hugo; Ferchaud, Anne-Laure; Normandeau, Eric; Gagnaire, Pierre-Alexandre; Bernatchez, Louis	The role of recombination on genome-wide patterns of local ancestry exemplified by supplemented brook charr populations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Assessing the immediate and long-term evolutionary consequences of human-mediated hybridization is of major concern for conservation biology. Several studies have documented how selection in interaction with recombination modulates introgression at a genome-wide scale, but few have considered the dynamics of this process within and among chromosomes. Here, we used an exploited freshwater fish, the brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), for which decades of stocking practices have resulted in admixture between wild populations and an introduced domestic strain, to assess both the temporal dynamics and local chromosomal variation in domestic ancestry. We provide a detailed picture of the domestic ancestry patterns across the genome using about 33,000 mapped single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 611 individuals from 24 supplemented populations. For each lake, we distinguished early- and late-generation hybrids using information regarding admixture tracts. To assess the selective outcomes following admixture we then evaluated the relationship between recombination and admixture proportions at three different scales: the whole genome, chromosomes and within 2-Mb windows. This allowed us to detect a wide range of evolutionary mechanisms varying along the genome, as reflected by the finding of favoured or disfavoured introgression of domestic haplotypes. Among these, the main factor modulating local ancestry was probably the presence of deleterious recessive mutations in the wild populations, which can be efficiently hidden to selection in the presence of long admixture tracts. Overall, our results emphasize the relevance of taking into consideration local ancestry information to assess both the temporal and the chromosomal variation in local admixture ancestry toward better understanding post-hybridization evolutionary outcomes.	2019	10.1111/mec.15256		Fish	Salmoniformes	Salvinus	TRUE	TRUE	Tract length/number only	TRUE	sequence similarity, tract lenght comparisons	GBS (55267 loci)	TRUE	
Rougemont, Quentin; Bernatchez, Louis	The demographic history of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) across its distribution range reconstructed from approximate Bayesian computations	EVOLUTION	Understanding the dual roles of demographic and selective processes in the buildup of population divergence is one of the most challenging tasks in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the demographic history of Atlantic salmon across the entire species range using 2035 anadromous individuals from North America and Eurasia. By combining results from admixture graphs, geo-genetic maps, and an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework, we validated previous hypotheses pertaining to secondary contact between European and Northern American populations, but also identified secondary contacts in European populations from different glacial refugia. We further identified the major sources of admixture from the southern range of North America into more northern populations along with a strong signal of secondary gene flow between genetic regional groups. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect the spatial redistribution of ancestral variation across the entire North American range. Results also support a role for linked selection and differential introgression that likely played an underappreciated role in shaping the genomic landscape of species in the Northern hemisphere. We conclude that studies between partially isolated populations should systematically include heterogeneity in selective and introgressive effects among loci to perform more rigorous demographic inferences of the divergence process.	2018	10.1111/evo.13486		Fish	Salmoniformes	Salmo	TRUE	TRUE	No quantitative metrics given	TRUE	PCA, snmf, treemix, f3, demography	microarray (5087 loci)	TRUE	
Schumer, Molly; Cui, Rongfeng; Powell, Daniel L.; Rosenthal, Gil G.; Andolfatto, Peter	Ancient hybridization and genomic stabilization in a swordtail fish	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	A rapidly increasing body of work is revealing that the genomes of distinct species often exhibit hybrid ancestry, presumably due to postspeciation hybridization between closely related species. Despite the growing number of documented cases, we still know relatively little about how genomes evolve and stabilize following hybridization, and to what extent hybridization is functionally relevant. Here, we examine the case of Xiphophorus nezahualcoyotl, a teleost fish whose genome exhibits significant hybrid ancestry. We show that hybridization was relatively ancient and is unlikely to be ongoing. Strikingly, the genome of X. nezahualcoyotl has largely stabilized following hybridization, distinguishing it from examples such as human-Neanderthal hybridization. Hybridization-derived regions are remarkably distinct from other regions of the genome, tending to be enriched in genomic regions with reduced constraint. These results suggest that selection has played a role in removing hybrid ancestry from certain functionally important regions. Combined with findings in other systems, our results raise many questions about the process of genomic stabilization and the role of selection in shaping patterns of hybrid ancestry in the genome.	2016	10.1111/mec.13602		Fish	Cyprinodontiformes	Xiphophorus	TRUE	TRUE	Dfoil somewhere, could not locate	TRUE	phylonet, trees, Dfoil, sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE	
Souissi, Ahmed; Bonhomme, Francois; Manchado, Manuel; Bahri-Sfar, Lilia; Gagnaire, Pierre-Alexandre	Genomic and geographic footprints of differential introgression between two divergent fish species (Solea spp.)	HEREDITY	Investigating gene flow between closely related species and its variation across the genome is important to understand how reproductive barriers shape genome divergence before speciation is complete. An efficient way to characterize differential gene flow is to study how the genetic interactions that take place in hybrid zones selectively filter gene exchange between species, leading to heterogeneous genome divergence. In the present study, genome-wide divergence and introgression patterns were investigated between two sole species, Solea senegalensis and Solea aegyptiaca, using restriction-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) to analyze samples taken from a transect spanning the hybrid zone. An integrative approach combining geographic and genomic dines methods with an analysis of individual locus introgression accounting for the demographic history of divergence was conducted. Our results showed that the two sole species have come into secondary contact postglacially, after experiencing a prolonged period (ca. 1.1 to 1.8 Myrs) of allopatric separation. Secondary contact resulted in the formation of a tension zone characterized by strong reproductive isolation, which only allowed introgression in a limited fraction of the genome. We found multiple evidence for a preferential direction of introgression in the S. aegyptiaca genetic background, indicating a possible recent or ongoing movement of the hybrid zone. Deviant introgression signals found in the opposite direction suggested that S. senegalensis could have possibly undergone adaptive introgression that has not yet spread throughout the entire species range. Our study thus illustrates the varied outcomes of genetic interactions between divergent gene pools that recently met after a long history of divergence.	2018	10.1038/s41437-018-0079-9		Fish	Pleuronectiformes	Solea	TRUE	TRUE	Cline based methods	TRUE	demography, clines, fastStructure	RAD (10758 loci)	TRUE	
Taillebois, Laura; Sabatino, Stephen; Manicki, Aurelie; Daverat, Francoise; Jose Nachon, David; Lepais, Olivier	Variable outcomes of hybridization between declining Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Hybridization dynamics between co-occurring species in environments where human-mediated changes take place are important to quantify for furthering our understanding of human impacts on species evolution and for informing management. The allis shad Alosa alosa (Linnaeus, 1758) and twaite shad Alosa fallax (Lacepede, 1803), two clupeids sister species, have been severely impacted by human activities across Europe. The shrinkage of A. alosa distribution range along with the decline of the remaining populations' abundance threatens its persistence. The main objective was to evaluate the extent of hybridization and introgression between those interacting species. We developed a set of 77 species-specific SNP loci that allowed a better resolution than morphological traits as they enabled the detection of hybrids up to the third generation. Variable rates of contemporary hybridization and introgression patterns were detected in 12 studied sites across the French Atlantic coast. Mitochondrial markers revealed a cyto-nuclear discordance almost invariably involving A. alosa individuals with an A. fallax mitochondrial DNA and provided evidence of historical asymmetric introgression. Overall, contemporary and historical introgression revealed by nuclear and mitochondrial markers strongly suggests that a transfer of genes occurs from A. fallax toward A. alosa genome since at least four generations. Moreover, the outcomes of introgression greatly depend on the catchments where local processes are thought to occur. Undoubtedly, interspecific interaction and gene flow should not be overlooked when considering the management of those species.	2020	10.1111/eva.12889		Fish	Clupeiformes	Alosa	TRUE	TRUE	STRUCTURE to get admixture	TRUE	STRUCTURE, newHybrids, haplotype network	microarray (77 loci), mtDNA (56 loci)	TRUE	
Takehana, Yusuke; Sakai, Masato; Narita, Takanori; Sato, Tadashi; Naruse, Kiyoshi; Sakaizumi, Mitsuru	Origin of Boundary Populations in Medaka (Oryzias latipes Species Complex)	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE	The Japanese wild population of the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes species complex) comprises two genetically distinct groups, the Northern and the Southern Populations, with boundary populations having a unique genotype. It is thought that the boundary populations have been formed through introgressive hybridization between the two groups, because they are fixed with the Northern alleles at two allozymic loci, with the Southern alleles at two other loci, and have a unique allele at one locus. In this study, we examined the genetic population structure of the boundary populations using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Most SNPs of the Toyooka population, a typical boundary population, were shared with the Northern Population, some were shared with the Southern Population, and the remaining SNPs were unique to this population, suggesting that the boundary populations originated and diverged from the Northern Population. Further analyses of different populations using SNPs at eight genomic loci indicated that the boundary populations at different locations share similar genomic constitutions, and can be genetically distinguished from typical Northern Populations by unique SNPs. In addition, the boundary populations in the Maruyama River Basin had Northern mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), while others, from the Fukuda and Kishida River Basins and from the Kumihama Bay area, had Southern mtDNA. These findings suggested that the boundary populations originated from the Northern Population, and then their genomes diverged as a result of geographical isolation, followed by mtDNA introgression from the Southern Population that occurred independently in some populations.	2016	10.2108/zs150144		Fish	Beloniformes	Oryzias	TRUE	TRUE	mt/nuc discordance	TRUE	PCA, trees	Sanger (614 loci)	TRUE	
Wallis, Graham P.; Cameron-Christie, Sophia R.; Kennedy, Hannah L.; Palmer, Gemma; Sanders, Tessa R.; Winter, David J.	Interspecific hybridization causes long-term phylogenetic discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in freshwater fishes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Classification, phylogeography and the testing of evolutionary hypotheses rely on correct estimation of species phylogeny. Early molecular phylogenies often relied on mtDNA alone, which acts as a single linkage group with one history. Over the last decade, the use of multiple nuclear sequences has often revealed conflict among gene trees. This observation can be attributed to hybridization, lineage sorting, paralogy or selection. Here, we use 54 groups of fishes from 48 studies to estimate the degree of concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees in two ecological grades of fishes: marine and freshwater. We test the hypothesis that freshwater fish phylogenies should, on average, show more discordance because of their higher propensity for hybridization in the past. In keeping with this idea, concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees ( as measured by proportion of components shared) is on average 50% higher in marine fishes. We discuss why this difference almost certainly results from introgression caused by greater historical hybridization among lineages in freshwater groups, and further emphasize the need to use multiple nuclear genes, and identify conflict among them, in estimation of species phylogeny.	2017	10.1111/mec.14096		Fish	-	-	TRUE	TRUE	my/nuc tree comparisons	TRUE	tree discordance	Sanger (2 loci)	TRUE	
Skrede, Inger; Carlsen, Tor; Stensrud, Oyvind; Kauserud, Havard	Genome wide AFLP markers support cryptic species in Coniophora (Boletales)	FUNGAL BIOLOGY	Numerous fungal morphospecies include cryptic species that routinely are detected by sequencing a few unlinked DNA loci. However, whether the patterns observed by multi-locus sequencing are compatible with genome wide data, such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), is not well known for fungi. In this study we compared the ability of three DNA loci and AFLP data to discern between cryptic fungal lineages in the three morphospecies Coniophora olivacea, Coniophora arida, and Coniophora puteana. The sequences and the AFLP data were highly congruent in delimiting the morphotaxa Into multiple cryptic species. However, while the DNA sequences indicated introgression or hybridization between some of the cryptic lineages the AFLP data did not. We conclude that as few as three polymorphic DNA loci was sufficient to recognize cryptic lineages within the studied Coniophora taxa. However, based on analyses of a few (three) sequenced loci the hybridization could not easily be distinguished from incomplete lineage sorting. Hence, great caution should be taken when concluding about hybridization based on data from just a few loci. (C) 2012 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Dequin, Sylvie; Casaregola, Serge	The genomes of fermentative Saccharomyces	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES	Many different yeast species can take part in spontaneous fermentations, but the species of the genus Saccharomyces, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae in particular, play a leading role in the production of fermented beverages and food. In recent years, the development of whole-genome scanning techniques, such as DNA chip-based analysis and high-throughput sequencing methods, has considerably increased our knowledge of fermentative Saccharomyces genomes, shedding new light on the evolutionary history of domesticated strains and the molecular mechanisms involved in their adaptation to fermentative niches. Genetic exchange frequently occurs between fermentative Saccharomyces and is an important mechanism for generating diversity and for adaptation to specific ecological niches. We review and discuss here recent advances in the genomics of Saccharomyces species and related hybrids involved in major fermentation processes.

Kavanaugh, Laura A.; Fraser, James A.; Dietrich, Fred S.	Recent evolution of the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans by intervarietal transfer of a 14-gene fragment	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The availability of the whole-genome sequence from the 2 known varieties of the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans provides an opportunity to study the relative contribution of divergence and introgression during the process of speciation in a genetically tractable organism. At the genomic level, these varieties are nearly completely syntenic, share similar to 85-90% nucleotide identity, and are believed to have diverged similar to 18 MYA. Via a comparative genomic approach, we identified a 14-gene region (similar to 40 kb) that is nearly identical between the 2 varieties that resulted from a nonreciprocal transfer event from var. grubii to var. neoformans similar to 2 MYA. The majority of clinical and environmental var. neoformans strains from around the world contain this sequence obtained from var. grubii. This introgression event likely occurred via an incomplete intervarietal sexual cycle, creating a hybrid intermediate where mobile elements common to both lineages mediated the exchange. The subsequent duplication in laboratory strains of a fragment of this same genomic region supports evolutionary theories that instabilities in subtelomeric regions promote adaptive evolution through gene amplification and subsequent adaptation. Along with a more ancient predicted transfer event in C. neoformans and a recently reported example from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these data indicate that DNA exchange between closely related sympatric varieties or species may be a recurrent theme in the evolution of fungal species. It further suggests that although evolutionary divergence is the primary force driving speciation, rare introgression events also play a potentially important role.	2006	10.1093/molbev/msl070		Fungi	Tremellales	Cryptococcus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, PUAP	WGS (20Mb region)	TRUE	
Peris, David; Lopes, Christian A.; Arias, Armando; Barrio, Eladio	Reconstruction of the Evolutionary History of Saccharomyces cerevisiae x S-kudriavzevii Hybrids Based on Multilocus Sequence Analysis	PLOS ONE	In recent years, interspecific hybridization and introgression are increasingly recognized as significant events in the evolution of Saccharomyces yeasts. These mechanisms have probably been involved in the origin of novel yeast genotypes and phenotypes, which in due course were to colonize and predominate in the new fermentative environments created by human manipulation. The particular conditions in which hybrids arose are still unknown, as well as the number of possible hybridization events that generated the whole set of natural hybrids described in the literature during recent years. In this study, we could infer at least six different hybridization events that originated a set of 26 S. cerevisiae x S. kudriavzevii hybrids isolated from both fermentative and non-fermentative environments. Different wine S. cerevisiae strains and European S. kudriavzevii strains were probably involved in the hybridization events according to gene sequence information, as well as from previous data on their genome composition and ploidy. Finally, we postulate that these hybrids may have originated after the introduction of vine growing and winemaking practices by the Romans to the present Northern vine-growing limits and spread during the expansion of improved viticulture and enology practices that occurred during the Late Middle Ages.	2012	10.1371/journal.pone.0045527		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	SplitsTree, flow cytometry, sequence similarity	multilocus data (6 genes)	TRUE	
Peris, David; Arias, Armando; Orlic, Sandi; Belloch, Carmela; Perez-Traves, Laura; Querol, Amparo; Barrio, Eladio	Mitochondrial introgression suggests extensive ancestral hybridization events among Saccharomyces species	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in eukaryotic plastids and mitochondrial genomes is common, and plays an important role in organism evolution. In yeasts, recent mitochondrial HGT has been suggested between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. However, few strains have been explored given the lack of accurate mitochondrial genome annotations. Mitochondrial genome sequences are important to understand how frequent these introgressions occur, and their role in cytonuclear incompatibilities and fitness. Indeed, most of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller genetic incompatibilities described in yeasts are driven by cytonuclear incompatibilities. We herein explored the mitochondrial inheritance of several worldwide distributed wild Saccharomyces species and their hybrids isolated from different sources and geographic origins. We demonstrated the existence of several recombination points in mitochondrial region COX2-ORF1, likely mediated by either the activity of the protein encoded by the ORF1 (F-SceIII) gene, a freestanding homing endonuclease, or mostly facilitated by A+T tandem repeats and regions of integration of GC clusters. These introgressions were shown to occur among strains of the same species and among strains of different species, which suggests a complex model of Saccharomyces evolution that involves several ancestral hybridization events in wild environments.

Sillo, Fabiano; Gonthier, Paolo; Lockman, Blakey; Kasuga, Takao; Garbelotto, Matteo	Molecular analyses identify hybridization-mediated nuclear evolution in newly discovered fungal hybrids	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybridization may be a major driver in the evolution of plant pathogens. In a high elevation Alpine larch stand in Montana, a novel hybrid fungal pathogen of trees originating from the mating of Heterobasidion irregulare with H. occidentale has been recently discovered. In this study, sequence analyses of one mitochondrial and four nuclear loci from 11 Heterobasidion genotypes collected in the same Alpine larch stand indicated that hybridization has increased allelic diversity by generating novel polymorphisms unreported in either parental species. Sequence data and ploidy analysis through flow cytometry confirmed that heterokaryotic (n + n) genotypes were not first-generation hybrids, but were the result of multiple backcrosses, indicating hybrids are fertile. Additionally, all admixed genotypes possessed the H. occidentale mitochondrion, indicating that the hybrid progeny may have been backcrossing mostly with H. occidentale. Based on reticulate phylogenetic network analysis by PhyloNet, Bayesian assignment, and ordination tests, alleles can be defined as H. irregulare-like or H. occidentale-like. H. irregulare-like alleles are clearly distinct from all known H. irregulare alleles and are derived from the admixing of both Heterobasidion species. Instead, all but one H. occidentale alleles found in hybrids, although novel, were not clearly distinct from alleles found in the parental H. occidentale population. This discovery demonstrates that Alpine larch can be a universal host favouring the interspecific hybridization between H. irregulare and H. occidentale and the hybridization-mediated evolution of a nucleus, derived from H. irregulare parental species but clearly distinct from it.	2019	10.1002/ece3.5238		Fungi	Russulale	Heterobasidion	TRUE	TRUE	Phylonet on MLST	TRUE	STRUCTURE, PhyloNet, sequence similarity	Sanger (3 genes)	TRUE	
Wu, Qiong; James, Steve A.; Roberts, Ian N.; Moulton, Vincent; Huber, Katharina T.	Exploring contradictory phylogenetic relationships in yeasts	FEMS YEAST RESEARCH	Phylogenetic trees underlie our understanding of yeast evolution and are also proving instrumental in the development of a more robust yeast classification system based upon natural (i.e. evolutionary) relationships. In an effort to refine/improve taxonomic resolution, recent studies have focused on the use of multigene rather than single gene sequencing. Nevertheless, searches to determine 'the tree' remain problematic, as they can often overlook conflicts in the dataset. In such instances, phylogenetic networks such as neighbor-nets and consensus networks can provide a more useful and indeed more informative alternative means of analysis. In this study, we have used the latter two phylogenetic network techniques to reanalyze the multigene sequence dataset of Kurtzman & Robnett, which was used to redefine the taxonomy of the family Saccharomycetaceae. Results from our analyses show that, in general, established clades are robust. However, they also reveal conflict between mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded genes and indicate the existence of complex patterns of hybridization and introgression not detected in the original study. These patterns are discussed in relation to how they may impact upon the current classification of this group of yeasts.	2008	10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00362.x		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	SplitsTree	multilocus data (8 genes)	TRUE	
Muller, Ludo A. H.; McCusker, John H.	A multispecies-based taxonomic microarray reveals interspecies hybridization and introgression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FEMS YEAST RESEARCH	A multispecies-based taxonomic microarray targeting coding sequences of diverged orthologous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, Naumovia castellii, Lachancea kluyveri and Candida glabrata was designed to allow identification of isolates of these species and their interspecies hybrids. Analysis of isolates of several Saccharomyces species and interspecies hybrids demonstrated the ability of the microarray to differentiate these yeasts on the basis of their specific hybridization patterns. Subsequent analysis of 183 supposed S. cerevisiae isolates of various ecological and geographical backgrounds revealed one misclassified S. bayanus or Saccharomyces uvarum isolate and four aneuploid interspecies hybrids, one between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus and three between S. cerevisiae and S. kudriavzevii. Furthermore, this microarray design allowed the detection of multiple introgressed S. paradoxus DNA fragments in the genomes of three different S. cerevisiae isolates. These results show the power of multispecies-based microarrays as taxonomic tools for the identification of species and interspecies hybrids, and their ability to provide a more detailed characterization of interspecies hybrids and recombinants.	2009	10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00464.x		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	microarray (5 genes)	TRUE	
Novo, Maite; Bigey, Frederic; Beyne, Emmanuelle; Galeote, Virginie; Gavory, Frederick; Mallet, Sandrine; Cambon, Brigitte; Legras, Jean-Luc; Wincker, Patrick; Casaregola, Serge; Dequin, Sylvie	Eukaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfer events revealed by the genome sequence of the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC1118	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for millennia in winemaking, but little is known about the selective forces acting on the wine yeast genome. We sequenced the complete genome of the diploid commercial wine yeast EC1118, resulting in an assembly of 31 scaffolds covering 97% of the S288c reference genome. The wine yeast differed strikingly from the other S. cerevisiae isolates in possessing 3 unique large regions, 2 of which were subtelomeric, the other being inserted within an EC1118 chromosome. These regions encompass 34 genes involved in key wine fermentation functions. Phylogeny and synteny analyses showed that 1 of these regions originated from a species closely related to the Saccharomyces genus, whereas the 2 other regions were of non-Saccharomyces origin. We identified Zygosaccharomyces bailii, a major contaminant of wine fermentations, as the donor species for 1 of these 2 regions. Although natural hybridization between Saccharomyces strains has been described, this report provides evidence that gene transfer may occur between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces species. We show that the regions identified are frequent and differentially distributed among S. cerevisiae clades, being found almost exclusively in wine strains, suggesting acquisition through recent transfer events. Overall, these data show that the wine yeast genome is subject to constant remodeling through the contribution of exogenous genes. Our results suggest that these processes are favored by ecologic proximity and are involved in the molecular adaptation of wine yeasts to conditions of high sugar, low nitrogen, and high ethanol concentrations.	2009	10.1073/pnas.0904673106		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PHYLIP, sequence similarity	microsatellite (11 loci)	TRUE	
Perez-Traves, Laura; Lopes, Christian A.; Querol, Amparo; Barrio, Eladio	On the Complexity of the Saccharomyces bayanus Taxon: Hybridization and Potential Hybrid Speciation	PLOS ONE	Although the genus Saccharomyces has been thoroughly studied, some species in the genus has not yet been accurately resolved; an example is S. bayanus, a taxon that includes genetically diverse lineages of pure and hybrid strains. This diversity makes the assignation and classification of strains belonging to this species unclear and controversial. They have been subdivided by some authors into two varieties (bayanus and uvarum), which have been raised to the species level by others. In this work, we evaluate the complexity of 46 different strains included in the S. bayanus taxon by means of PCR-RFLP analysis and by sequencing of 34 gene regions and one mitochondrial gene. Using the sequence data, and based on the S. bayanus var. bayanus reference strain NBRC 1948, a hypothetical pure S. bayanus was reconstructed for these genes that showed alleles with similarity values lower than 97% with the S. bayanus var. uvarum strain CBS 7001, and of 99-100% with the non S. cerevisiae portion in S. pastorianus Weihenstephan 34/70 and with the new species S. eubayanus. Among the S. bayanus strains under study, different levels of homozygosity, hybridization and introgression were found; however, no pure S. bayanus var. bayanus strain was identified. These S. bayanus hybrids can be classified into two types: homozygous (type I) and heterozygous hybrids (type II), indicating that they have been originated by different hybridization processes. Therefore, a putative evolutionary scenario involving two different hybridization events between a S. bayanus var. uvarum and unknown European S. eubayanus-like strains can be postulated to explain the genomic diversity observed in our S. bayanus var. bayanus strains.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0093729		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	jModelTest, PHYML, sequence similairty	Amplicon (9 genes), mtDNA (1 gene)	TRUE	
Rolland, Thomas; Neuveglise, Cecile; Sacerdot, Christine; Dujon, Bernard	Insertion of Horizontally Transferred Genes within Conserved Syntenic Regions of Yeast Genomes	PLOS ONE	Horizontal gene transfer has been occasionally mentioned in eukaryotic genomes, but such events appear much less numerous than in prokaryotes, where they play important functional and evolutionary roles. In yeasts, few independent cases have been described, some of which corresponding to major metabolic functions, but no systematic screening of horizontally transferred genes has been attempted so far. Taking advantage of the synteny conservation among five newly sequenced and annotated genomes of Saccharomycetaceae, we carried out a systematic search for HGT candidates amidst genes present in only one species within conserved synteny blocks. Out of 255 species-specific genes, we discovered 11 candidates for HGT, based on their similarity with bacterial proteins and on reconstructed phylogenies. This corresponds to a minimum of six transfer events because some horizontally acquired genes appear to rapidly duplicate in yeast genomes (e. g. YwqG genes in Kluyveromyces thermotolerans and serine recombinase genes of the IS607 family in Saccharomyces kluyveri). We show that the resulting copies are submitted to a strong functional selective pressure. The mechanisms of DNA transfer and integration are discussed, in relation with the generally small size of HGT candidates. Our results on a limited set of species expand by 50% the number of previously published HGT cases in hemiascomycetous yeasts, suggesting that this type of event is more frequent than usually thought. Our restrictive method does not exclude the possibility that additional HGT events exist. Actually, ancestral events common to several yeast species must have been overlooked, and the absence of homologs in present databases leaves open the question of the origin of the 244 remaining species-specific genes inserted within conserved synteny blocks.	2009	10.1371/journal.pone.0006515		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	PHYML, sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE	
Gonthier, P.; Garbelotto, M.	Amplified fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses reveal massive gene introgression from the European fungal pathogen Heterobasidion annosum into its introduced congener H. irregulare	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The paucity of fungal species known to be currently hybridizing has significantly hindered our understanding of the mechanisms driving gene introgression in these eukaryotic microbes. Here, we describe an area of hybridization and gene introgression between the invasive plant pathogen Heterobasidion irregulare (introduced from North America) and the native H. annosum in Italy. A STRUCTURE analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism data for 267 individuals identified gene introgression in 8-42% of genotypes in the invasion area, depending on site. Data indicate that introgression is mostly occurring unilaterally from the native to the invasive species and is responsible for 5-45% of genomes in admixed individuals. Sequence analysis of 11 randomly selected and unlinked loci for 30 individuals identified introgression at every locus, thus confirming interspecific gene flow involves a large number of loci. In 37 cases, we documented movement of entire alleles between the two species, but in 7 cases, we also documented the creation of new alleles through intralocus recombination. Sequence analysis did not identify enrichment of either transcriptionally different nonsynonymous alleles or of transcriptionally identical synonymous alleles. These findings may suggest introgression is occurring randomly for extant alleles without an obvious enrichment process driven by selection. However, further studies are needed to ensure selection is not at work elsewhere in the genome.	2011	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05121.x		Fungi	Russulale	Heterobasidion	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, PUAP, sequence similarity	AFLP (564 loci)	TRUE	
Leducq, Jean-Baptiste; Henault, Mathieu; Charron, Guillaume; Nielly-Thibault, Lou; Terrat, Yves; Fiumera, Heather L.; Shapiro, B. Jesse; Landry, Christian R.	Mitochondrial Recombination and Introgression during Speciation by Hybridization	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Genome recombination is a major source of genotypic diversity and contributes to adaptation and speciation following interspecies hybridization. The contribution of recombination in these processes has been thought to be largely limited to the nuclear genome because organelles are mostly uniparentally inherited in animals and plants, which prevents recombination. Unicellular eukaryotes such as budding yeasts do, however, transmit mitochondria biparentally, suggesting that during hybridization, both parents could provide alleles that contribute to mitochondrial functions such as respiration and metabolism in hybrid populations or hybrid species. We examined the dynamics of mitochondrial genome transmission and evolution during speciation by hybridization in the natural budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus. Using population-scale mitochondrial genome sequencing in two endemic North American incipient species SpB and SpC and their hybrid species SpC*, we found that both parental species contributed to the hybrid mitochondrial genome through recombination. We support our findings by showing that mitochondrial recombination between parental types is frequent in experimental crosses that recreate the early step of this speciation event. In these artificial hybrids, we observed that mitochondrial genome recombination enhances phenotypic variation among diploid hybrids, suggesting that it could play a role in the phenotypic differentiation of hybrid species. Like the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome can, therefore, also play a role in hybrid speciation.	2017	10.1093/molbev/msx139		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Saccharomyces	TRUE	TRUE	expieremental crosses	FALSE			TRUE	
Kobmoo, Noppol; Mongkolsamrit, Suchada; Arnamnart, Nuntanat; Luangsa-ard, Janet Jennifer; Giraud, Tatiana	Population genomics revealed cryptic species within host-specific zombie-ant fungi (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	The identification and delimitation of species boundaries are essential for understanding speciation and adaptation processes and for the management of biodiversity as well as development for applications. Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato is a complex of fungal pathogens parasitizing Formicine ants, inducing zombie behaviors in their hosts. Previous taxonomic works with limited numbers of samples and markers led to the "one ant-one fungus" paradigm, resulting in the use of ant species as a proxy for fungal identification. Here, a population genomics study with sampling on three ant species across Thailand supported the existence of host-specific species in O. unilateralis s.l. with no footprints of long term introgression despite occasional host shifts and firstgeneration hybrids. We further detected genetic clusters within the previously delimited fungal species, with each little footprints of recombination, suggesting high levels of inbreeding. The clusters within each of O. camponoti-leonardi and O. camponoti-saundersi were supported by differentiation throughout the genome, suggesting they may constitute further cryptic species parasitizing the same host, challenging the one ant-one fungus paradigm. These genetic clusters had different geographical ranges, supporting different biogeographic influences between the north/center and the south of Thailand, reinforcing the scenario in which Thailand endured compartmentation during the latest Pleistocene glacial cycles.	2019	10.1016/j.ympev.2019.106580		Fungi	Hypocreales	Ophiocordyceps	TRUE	TRUE	treemix	TRUE	RAxML, BUCKy, MrBayes, PCA, fastSTRUCTURE, sequence similarity, treemix	WGS	TRUE	
Michelotto, Marcos Doniseti; Barioni, Waldomiro, Jr.; Vilela de Resende, Marcos Deon; de Godoy, Ignacio Jose; Leonardecz, Eduardo; Favero, Alessandra Pereira	Identification of Fungus Resistant Wild Accessions and Interspecific Hybrids of the Genus Arachis	PLOS ONE	Peanut, Arachis hypogaea L., is a protein-rich species consumed worldwide. A key improvement to peanut culture involves the development of cultivars that resist fungal diseases such as rust, leaf spot and scab. Over three years, we evaluated fungal resistance under field conditions of 43 wild accessions and three interspecific hybrids of the genus Arachis, as well as six A. hypogaea genotypes. In the first year, we evaluated resistance to early and late leaf spot, rust and scab. In the second and third years, we evaluated the 18 wild species with the best resistance scores and control cultivar IAC Caiapo for resistance to leaf spot and rust. All wild accessions displayed greater resistance than A. hypogaea but differed in their degree of resistance, even within the same species. We found accessions with as good as or better resistance than A. cardenasii, including: A. stenosperma (V15076 and Sv 3712), A. kuhlmannii (V 6413), A. kempff-mercadoi (V 13250), A. hoehnei (KG 30006), and A. helodes (V 6325). Amphidiploids and hybrids of A. hypogaea behaved similarly to wild species. An additional four accessions deserve further evaluation: A. magna (V 13751 and KG 30097) and A. gregoryi (V 14767 and V 14957). Although they did not display as strong resistance as the accessions cited above, they belong to the B genome type that is crucial to resistance gene introgression and pyramidization in A. hypogaea.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0128811		Plants	Fabales	Arachis	TRUE	TRUE	did not test for introgression	FALSE			TRUE

To gain insight into the recent evolution of C. metapsilosis and the genetic basis of its virulence, we sequenced the genome of 11 clinical isolates from various locations, which we compared to each other and to the available genomes of the two remaining members of the complex: C. orthopsilosis and C. parapsilosis. Unexpectedly, we found compelling genomic evidence that C. metapsilosis is a highly heterozygous hybrid species, with all sequenced clinical strains resulting from the same past hybridization event involving two parental lineages that were approximately 4.5% divergent in sequence. This result indicates that the parental species are non-pathogenic, but that hybridization between them formed a new opportunistic pathogen, C. metapsilosis, that has achieved a worldwide distribution. We show that these hybrids are diploid and we identified strains carrying loci for both alternative mating types, which supports mating as the initial mechanism for hybrid formation. We trace the aftermath of this hybridization at the genomic level, and reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the different strains. Recombination and introgression -resulting in loss of heterozygosis- between the two subgenomes have been rampant, and includes the partial overwriting of the MTLa mating locus in all strains. Collectively, our results shed light on the recent genomic evolution within the C. parapsilosis sensu lato complex, and argue for a re-definition of species within this clade, with at least five distinct homozygous lineages, some of which having the ability to form hybrids.	2015	10.1371/journal.pgen.1005626		Fungi	Saccharomycetales	Candida	TRUE	TRUE	trees, no numbers	TRUE	sequence similarity, PhyML, RAxML	WGS	TRUE

Insight into the roles of selection in speciation from genomic patterns of divergence and introgression in secondary contact in venomous rattlesnakes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Investigating secondary contact of historically isolated lineages can provide insight into how selection and drift influence genomic divergence and admixture. Here, we studied the genomic landscape of divergence and introgression following secondary contact between lineages of the Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) to determine whether genomic regions under selection in allopatry also contribute to reproductive isolation during introgression. We used thousands of nuclear loci to study genomic differentiation between two lineages that have experienced recent secondary contact following isolation, and incorporated sampling from a zone of secondary contact to identify loci that are resistant to gene flow in hybrids. Comparisons of patterns of divergence and introgression revealed a positive relationship between allelic differentiation and resistance to introgression across the genome, and greater-than-expected overlap between genes linked to lineage-specific divergence and loci that resist introgression. Genes linked to putatively selected markers were related to prominent aspects of rattlesnake biology that differ between populations of Western Diamondback rattlesnakes (i.e., venom and reproductive phenotypes). We also found evidence for selection against introgression of genes that may contribute to cytonuclear incompatibility, consistent with previously observed biased patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial alleles suggestive of partial reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear incompatibilities. Our results provide a genome-scale perspective on the relationships between divergence and introgression in secondary contact that is relevant for understanding the roles of selection in maintaining partial isolation of lineages, causing admixing lineages to not completely homogenize.	2017	10.1002/ece3.2996		Reptiles	Squamata	Crotalus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	dadi, STRUCTURE, cline analysis, sequence similarity	RAD (7031 snps)	TRUE	
Arntzen, Jan W.; de Vries, Wouter; Canestrelli, Daniele; Martinez-Solano, Inigo	Hybrid zone formation and contrasting outcomes of secondary contact over transects in common toads	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Much progress in speciation research stems from documenting patterns of morphological and genetic variation in hybrid zones. Contrasting patterns of marker introgression in different sections of the contact can provide valuable insights on the relative importance of various evolutionary mechanisms maintaining species differences in the face of hybridization and gene flow and on hybrid zone temporal and spatial dynamics. We studied species interactions in the common toads Bufo bufo and B.spinosus in France and northwestern Italy using morphological and molecular data from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in an extensive survey, including two independent transects west and east of the Alps. At both, we found sharp, coincident and concordant nuclear genetic transitions. However, morphological clines were wider or absent and mtDNA introgression was asymmetric. We discuss alternative, nonexclusive hypotheses about evolutionary processes generating these patterns, including drift, selection, long-distance dispersal and spatial shifts in hybrid zone location and structure. The distribution of intraspecific mtDNA lineages supports a scenario in which B.bufo held a local refugium during the last glacial maximum. Present-day genetic profiles are best explained by an advance of B.spinosus from a nearby Iberian refugium, largely superseding the local B.bufo population, followed by an advance of B.bufo from the Balkans, with prongs north and south of the Alps, driving B.spinosus southwards. A pendulum moving hybrid zone, first northwards and then southwards, explains the wide areas of introgression at either side of the current position of the contact zones.	2017	10.1111/mec.14273		Amphibian	Anura	Bufo	TRUE	TRUE	mtDNA and nuclear markers	TRUE	clinal analysis 	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE

Nurnberger, Beate; Lohse, Konrad; Fijarczyk, Anna; Szymura, Jacek M.; Blaxter, Mark L.	Para-allopatry in hybridizing fire-bellied toads (Bombina bombina and B. variegata): Inference from transcriptome-wide coalescence analyses	EVOLUTION	Ancient origins, profound ecological divergence, and extensive hybridization make the fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata (Anura: Bombinatoridae) an intriguing test case of ecological speciation. Previous modeling has proposed that the narrow Bombina hybrid zones represent strong barriers to neutral introgression. We test this prediction by inferring the rate of gene exchange between pure populations on either side of the intensively studied Krakow transect. We developed a method to extract high confidence sets of orthologous genes from de novo transcriptome assemblies, fitted a range of divergence models to these data and assessed their relative support with analytic likelihood calculations. There was clear evidence for postdivergence gene flow, but, as expected, no perceptible signal of recent introgression via the nearby hybrid zone. The analysis of two additional Bombina taxa (B. v. scabra and B. orientalis) validated our parameter estimates against a larger set of prior expectations. Despite substantial cumulative introgression over millions of years, adaptive divergence of the hybridizing taxa is essentially unaffected by their lack of reproductive isolation. Extended distribution ranges also buffer them against small-scale environmental perturbations that have been shown to reverse the speciation process in other, more recent ecotypes.	2016	10.1111/evo.12978		Amphibian	Anura	Bombina	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	demographic models	transcriptome (75000 loci)	TRUE	
Fitzpatrick, Benjamin M.; Johnson, Jarrett R.; Kump, D. Kevin; Shaffer, H. Bradley; Smith, Jeramiah J.; Voss, S. Randal	Rapid fixation of non-native alleles revealed by genome-wide SNP analysis of hybrid tiger salamanders	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Hybrid zones represent valuable opportunities to observe evolution in systems that are unusually dynamic and where the potential for the origin of novelty and rapid adaptation co-occur with the potential for dysfunction. Recently initiated hybrid zones are particularly exciting evolutionary experiments because ongoing natural selection on novel genetic combinations can be studied in ecological time. Moreover, when hybrid zones involve native and introduced species, complex genetic patterns present important challenges for conservation policy. To assess variation of admixture dynamics, we scored a large panel of markers in five wild hybrid populations formed when Barred Tiger Salamanders were introduced into the range of California Tiger Salamanders. Results: At three of 64 markers, introduced alleles have largely displaced native alleles within the hybrid populations. Another marker (GNAT1) showed consistent heterozygote deficits in the wild, and this marker was associated with embryonic mortality in laboratory F2's. Other deviations from equilibrium expectations were idiosyncratic among breeding ponds, consistent with highly stochastic demographic effects. Conclusion: While most markers retain native and introduced alleles in expected proportions, strong selection appears to be eliminating native alleles at a smaller set of loci. Such rapid fixation of alleles is detectable only in recently formed hybrid zones, though it might be representative of dynamics that frequently occur in nature. These results underscore the variable and mosaic nature of hybrid genomes and illustrate the potency of recombination and selection in promoting variable, and often unpredictable genetic outcomes. Introgression of a few, strongly selected introduced alleles should not necessarily affect the conservation status of California Tiger Salamanders, but suggests that genetically pure populations of this endangered species will be difficult to maintain.	2009	10.1186/1471-2148-9-176		Amphibian	Urodela	Ambystoma	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest and only marker loci	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (64 markers)	TRUE	
Veith, Michael; Baumgart, Andrea; Dubois, Alain; Ohler, Annemarie; Galan, Pedro; Vieites, David R.; Nieto-roman, Sandra; Vences, Miguel	Discordant Patterns of Nuclear and Mitochondrial Introgression in Iberian Populations of the European Common Frog (Rana temporaria)	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	Amphibians often show complex histories of intraspecific and interspecific genetic introgression, which might differ in mitochondrial and nuclear genes. In our study of the genetic differentiation of the European common frog, Rana temporaria (159 specimens from 23 populations were analyzed for 24 presumptive allozyme loci; 82 specimens were sequenced for a 540-bp fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene), multilocus correspondence analysis (CA) and Bayesian assignment tests of the nuclear data were concordant in identifying 2 population groups corresponding to 1) the Pyrenees in the east and 2) the Galicia and Asturias regions in the west, the latter corresponding to the subspecies R. temporaria parvipalmata. Geographically intermediate populations were genetically intermediate in the allozyme CA and, less clearly in the Bayesian assignment, with mitochondrial haplotypes exclusively belonging to the parvipalmata group. This indicates different degrees of introgression in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Although Pyrenean high-altitude populations are morphologically distinct from low-altitude populations, these 2 groups were not separate clusters in any analysis. This suggests that the morphological differences may be due to fast adaptation to elevational gradients, likely under maintenance of gene flow, and that the underlying genetic changes are not detectable by the analyzed markers. We argue that a parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern along the east-west axis in northern Spain may be competition between invading and resident populations, with no need to invoke selection. However, in order to conclusively rule out selective processes, additional and finer scale data are required to test for asymmetric mating preference/ behaviour, sex-biased gene flow, or sex-biased survival of potential hybrids.	2012	10.1093/jhered/esr136		Amphibian	Anura	Rana	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity	Allozymes (24 loci)	TRUE	
Jancuchova-Laskova, Jitka; Landova, Eva; Frynta, Daniel	Experimental Crossing of Two Distinct Species of Leopard Geckos, Eublepharis angramainyu and E. macularius: Viability, Fertility and Phenotypic Variation of the Hybrids	PLOS ONE	Hybridization between distinct species of animals and subsequent genetic introgression plays a considerable role in the speciation process and the emergence of adaptive characters. Fitness of between-species hybrids usually sharply decreases with the divergence time of the concerned species and the divergence depth, which still allows for a successful crossing differs among principal clades of vertebrates. Recently, a review of hybridization events among distinct lizard species revealed that lizards belong to vertebrates with a highly developed ability to hybridize. In spite of this, reliable reports of experimental hybridizations between genetically fairly divergent species are only exceptional. Here, we show the results of the crossing of two distinct allopatric species of eyelid geckos possessing temperature sex determination and lacking sex chromosomes: Eublepharis macularius distributed in Pakistan/Afghanistan area and E. angramainyu, which inhabits Mesopotamia and adjacent areas. We demonstrated that F-1 hybrids were viable and fertile, and the introgression of E. angramainyu genes into the E. macularius genome can be enabled via a backcrossing. The examined hybrids (except those of the F-2 generation) displayed neither malformations nor a reduced survival. Analyses of morphometric and coloration traits confirmed phenotypic distinctness of both parental species and their F-1 hybrids. These findings contrast with long-term geographic and an evolutionary separation of the studied species. Thus, the occurrence of fertile hybrids of comparably divergent species, such as E. angramainyu and E. macularius, may also be expected in other taxa of squamates. This would violate the current estimates of species diversity in lizards.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0143630		Reptiles	Squamata	Eublepharis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE	Hybrid production and fitness measurements	NA	TRUE	
Seidl, Fabian; Levis, Nicholas A.; Jones, Corbin D.; Monroy-Eklund, Anais; Ehrenreich, Ian M.; Pfennig, Karin S.	Variation in hybrid gene expression: Implications for the evolution of genetic incompatibilities in interbreeding species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Interbreeding species often produce low-fitness hybrids due to genetic incompatibilities between parental genomes. Whether these incompatibilities reflect fixed allelic differences between hybridizing species, or, alternatively, standing variants that segregate within them, remains unknown for many natural systems. Yet, evaluating these alternatives is important for understanding the origins and nature of species boundaries. We examined these alternatives using spadefoot toads (genus Spea), which naturally hybridize. Specifically, we contrasted patterns of gene expression in hybrids relative to pure-species types in experimentally produced tadpoles from allopatric parents versus those from sympatric parents. We evaluated the prediction that segregating variation should result in gene expression differences between hybrids derived from sympatric parents versus hybrids derived from allopatric parents, and found that 24% of the transcriptome showed such differences. Our results further suggest that gene expression in hybrids has evolved in sympatry owing to evolutionary pressures associated with ongoing hybridization. Although we did not measure hybrid incompatibilities directly, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the nature of hybrid incompatibilities, how they might vary across populations over time, and the resulting effects on the evolutionary maintenance - or breakdown - of reproductive barriers between species.	2019	10.1111/mec.15246		Amphibian	Anura	Spea	TRUE	TRUE	line crosses	TRUE	expression similarity	transcriptome (9327 genes)	TRUE	
Yang, Weizhao; While, Geoffrey M.; Laakkonen, Hanna; Sacchi, Roberto; Zuffi, Marco A. L.; Scali, Stefano; Salvi, Daniele; Uller, Tobias	Genomic evidence for asymmetric introgression by sexual selection in the common wall lizard	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Strongly selected characters can be transferred from one lineage to another with limited genetic exchange, resulting in asymmetric introgression and a mosaic genome in the receiving population. However, systems are rarely sufficiently well studied to link the pattern of introgression to its underlying process. Male common wall lizards in western Italy exhibit exaggeration of a suite of sexually selected characters that make them outcompete males from a distantly related lineage that lack these characters. This results in asymmetric hybridization and adaptive introgression of the suite of characters following secondary contact. We developed genomewide markers to infer the demographic history of gene flow between different genetic lineages, identify the spread of the sexually selected syndrome, and test the prediction that introgression should be asymmetric and heterogeneous across the genome. Our results show that secondary contact was accompanied by gene flow in both directions across most of the genome, but with approximately 3% of the genome showing highly asymmetric introgression in the predicted direction. Demographic simulations reveal that this asymmetric gene flow is more recent than the initial secondary contact, and the data suggest that the exaggerated male sexual characters originated within the Italian lineage and subsequently spread throughout this lineage before eventually reaching the contact zone. These results demonstrate that sexual selection can cause a suite of characters to spread throughout both closely and distantly related lineages with limited gene flow across the genome at large.	2018	10.1111/mec.14861		Reptiles	Squamata	Podarcis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	clines, sequence similarity, demography	RAD (22000 loci)	TRUE

Randal	Identification of Mutant Genes and Introgressed Tiger Salamander DNA in the Laboratory Axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	The molecular genetic toolkit of the Mexican axolotl, a classic model organism, has matured to the point where it is now possible to identify genes for mutant phenotypes. We used a positional cloningcandidate gene approach to identify molecular bases for two historic axolotl pigment phenotypes: white and albino. White (d/d) mutants have defects in pigment cell morphogenesis and differentiation, whereas albino (a/a) mutants lack melanin. We identified in white mutants a transcriptional defect in endothelin 3 (edn3), encoding a peptide factor that promotes pigment cell migration and differentiation in other vertebrates. Transgenic restoration of Edn3 expression rescued the homozygous white mutant phenotype. We mapped the albino locus to tyrosinase (tyr) and identified polymorphisms shared between the albino allele (tyr(a)) and tyr alleles in a Minnesota population of tiger salamanders from which the albino trait was introgressed. tyr(a) has a 142 bp deletion and similar engineered alleles recapitulated the albino phenotype. Finally, we show that historical introgression of tyra significantly altered genomic composition of the laboratory axolotl, yielding a distinct, hybrid strain of ambystomatid salamander. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of identifying genes for traits in the laboratory Mexican axolotl.	2017	10.1038/s41598-017-00059-1		Amphibian	Urodela	Ambystoma	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE	
Haenel, Gregory J.; Moore, Victoria Del Gaizo	Functional Divergence of Mitochondria and Coevolution of Genomes: Cool Mitochondria in Hot Lizards	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY	Mitochondria play a key role in the ecology and evolution of species through their influence on aerobic metabolism. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear genomes must interact for optimal functioning of oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP, and breakdown of coadaptation components from each may have important evolutionary consequences for hybridization. Introgression of mitochondria in natural populations through hybridization with unidirectional backcrossing allows the testing of coadaptation of mitochondria to different nuclear backgrounds. We compared the function of mitochondria isolated from two species of Urosaurus lizards and hybrid populations. Due to past introgression, hybrids contain the nuclear genome of the hot-adapted species (U. graciosus) but the mtDNA of the less heat-tolerant species (U. ornatus). It was found that the function of the parental forms of mitochondria had significantly diverged with the hot-adapted species. There was significant genotype x genotype x environment interactions for mitochondrial membrane potential and genotype x genotype interactions for ATP production. Membrane potential decreased less at a higher temperature, while ATP production was higher at both temperatures in introgressed mitochondria. Oxygen consumption was lower in U. graciosus than in U. ornatus parental-type mitochondria, indicating a likely response to living in hotter environments. Respiratory control ratio values, which provide an indication of the functional quality of isolated mitochondria, were lower in introgressed mitochondria than in parental U. ornatus types, indicating a negative impact on biological function in introgressed mitochondria.	2018	10.1086/699918		Reptiles	Squamata	Urosaurus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity	mtDNA (1 gene?)

Hofman, Sebastian; Pabijan, Maciej; Dziewulska-Szwajkowska, Dania; Szymura, Jacek M.	Mitochondrial genome organization and divergence in hybridizing central European waterfrogs of the Pelophylax esculentus complex (Anura, Ranidae)	GENE	Natural transfer of mitochondrial DNA has occurred between three western Palaearctic waterfrog taxa: Pelophylax lessonae, Pelophylax ridibundus and their hybridogenetic hybrid, Pelophylax kl. esculentus. The transfer is asymmetric with most P. kl. esculentus and approximately one third of all central European P. ridibundus having mtDNA derived from P. lessonae (L-mtDNA). We obtained complete nucleotide sequences of multiple mitochondrial genomes (15,376-78 bp without control regions) from all 3 taxa, including a P. ridibundus frog with introgressed L-mtDNA. The gene content and organization of the mitogenomes correspond to those typical of neobatrachians. Divergence between the mtDNAs of P. lessonae and P. ridibundus is high with an uncorrected p-distance of 11.9% across the entire mitogenome. However, the rate of nucleotide substitution depends on the degree of functional constraint with up to 30-fold differences in levels of divergence. In general, mitochondrial genes encoding the translational machinery evolve very slowly, whereas genes encoding polypeptides of the electron transport system, especially the ND genes, evolve rapidly. Only 25 of 211-213 observed amino acid replacements could be classified as radical and are therefore more likely to be exposed to selection. A disproportionately high number of amino acid substitutions has occurred in the ND4, ND4L and cytb genes of the P. lessonae lineage (including 36% of all radical changes). In contrast to the interspecific divergence, nucleotide polymorphism within L- and R-mtDNA is very low: L-mtDNA haplotypes differed on average by only 19 nucleotides, while there was no variation within two mtDNAs derived from P. ridibundus. This is an expected finding considering that we have sampled a post-glacial expansion area. Moreover, the introgressed L-mtDNA on a P. ridibundus background differed from other L-mtDNAs by only a few substitutions, indicative of a very recent introgression event. We discuss our findings in the context of natural selection acting on L-mtDNA and its potential significance in cytonuclear epistasis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Komaki, Shohei; Kurabayashi, Atsushi; Islam, Mohammed Mafizul; Tojo, Koji; Sumida, Masayuki	Distributional Change and Epidemic Introgression in Overlapping Areas of Japanese Pond Frog Species over 30 Years	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE	Pelophylax nigromaculatus, P. porosus porosus, and P. p. brevipoda are three pond frog species distributed in Japan. Their distributions overlap at two basins in central Japan (P. nigromaculatus and P. p. porosus in the Matsumoto basin, and P. nigromaculatus and P. p. brevipoda in the Ina basin), and hybrid descendants have been found in these areas. To clarify the distribution areas and hybrid zones of the frogs, and to understand the mode of introgressive hybridization and its impact on the frog populations, we conducted exhaustive sampling at each basin and performed allozyme and mtDNA analyses of 233 individuals. Analysis using genetic markers clearly detected nine F1 hybrids and 94 hybrid descendants of P. nigromaculatus and P. porosus from the overlapping areas of both basins. Allozyme and mtDNA data suggest directional hybridization between female P. p. porosus and male P. nigromaculatus in the Matsumoto basin. Over the past 30 years, the distribution of P. p. porosus has been narrowed and fragmented by the invasion of P. nigromaculatus, seemingly because of directional hybridization in the Matsumoto basin. In the Ina basin, the "pure" P. p. brevipoda (n = 8) population was extremely reduced by gene introgression from P. nigromaculatus, yet its distribution was barely changed compared to the Matsumoto basin. Consequently, this study shows that P. porosus populations are threatened by interspecific hybridization with P. nigromaculatus, and that introgressive hybridization damaged P. porosus populations by different means in each basin.	2012	10.2108/zsj.29.351		Amphibian	Anura	Pelophylax	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	allozymes (4 loci), Sanger (1 locus)	TRUE

Their numbers have been reduced severely by hunting and habitat fragmentation. A reintroduction plan involving captive-bred populations that are used commercially is important and necessary as a conservation strategy to aid in the recovery of wild populations. Here, the genetic diversity and population structure of 69 individual crocodiles, mostly members of captive populations, were analyzed using both mitochondrial D-loop DNA and microsatellite markers. The overall haplotype diversity was 0.924-0.971 and the mean expected heterozygosity across 22 microsatellite loci was 0.578-0.701 for the two species. This agreed with the star-like shaped topology of the haplotype network, which suggests a high level of genetic diversity. The mean ratio of the number of alleles to the allelic range (M ratio) for the populations of both species was considerably lower than the threshold of 0.68, which was interpreted as indicative of a historical genetic bottleneck. Microsatellite markers provided evidence of introgression for three individual crocodiles, which suggest that hybridization might have occurred between C. siamensis and C. porosus. D-loop sequence analysis detected bi-directional hybridization between male and female individuals of the parent species. Therefore, identification of genetically non-hybrid and hybrid individuals is important for long-term conservation management. Relatedness values were low within the captive populations, which supported their genetic integrity and the viability of a breeding and reintroduction management plan. This work constitutes the first step in establishing an appropriate source population from a scientifically managed perspective for an in situ/ex situ conservation program and reintroduction of crocodile individuals to the wild in Thailand.	2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0184526		Reptiles	Crocodilia	Crocodylus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees, PCA	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites (22)	TRUE	
Qi, Yin; Lu, Bin; Gao, Haiyan; Hu, Ping; Fu, Jinzhong	Hybridization and mitochondrial genome introgression between Rana chensinensis and R. kukunoris	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Mitochondrial genome (mito-genome) introgression among metazoans is commonplace, and several biological processes may promote such introgression. We examined two proposed processes for the mito-genome introgression between Rana chensinensis and R.kukunoris: natural hybridization and sex-biased dispersal. We sampled 477 individuals from 28 sites in the potential hybrid zone in the western Tsinling Mountains. Mitochondrial gene (cyt-b) trees were used to examine the introgression events. Microsatellite DNA loci, cyt-b and morphological data were used to identify hybrids and to examine the extent of natural hybridization. We detected rampant bidirectional introgressions, both ancient and recent, between the two species. Furthermore, we found a wide hybrid zone, and frequent and asymmetric hybridization. The hybrid zone cline analysis revealed a clear mitochondrial-nuclear discordance; while most nuclear markers displayed similar and steep clines, cyt-b had a displaced cline centre and a more gradual and wider cline. We also detected strong and asymmetric historical maternal gene flow across the hybrid zone. This widespread hybridization and detected low mito-nuclear conflicts may, at least partially, explain the high frequency of introgression. Lastly, microsatellite data and population genetic methods were used to assess sex-biased dispersal. A weak pattern of female-biased dispersal was detected in both species, suggesting it may not play an important role in the observed introgression. Our data are consistent with the hybridization hypothesis, but support for the sex-biased dispersal hypothesis is weak. We further suggest that selective advantages of the R.kukunoris-type mito-genome in thermal adaptation may also contribute to the introgression between the two species.	2014	10.1111/mec.12960		Amphibian	Anura	Rana	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, trees, clines	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites	TRUE	
Reis, Estefane Cardinot; Soares, L. S.; Lobo-Hajdu, G.	Evidence of olive ridley mitochondrial genome introgression into loggerhead turtle rookeries of Sergipe, Brazil	CONSERVATION GENETICS	The coastline of Sergipe state hosts the main Brazilian nesting sites of Lepidochelys olivacea (Eschscholtz, 1829). The second most abundant species of turtles in Sergipe is Caretta caretta (Linnaeus, 1758). Both sea turtle species, respectively known as olive ridley and loggerhead, are currently listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The genetic diversity of the Sergipe loggerhead population (N = 51) was assayed by analyzing 627 bp from the control region of mitochondrial DNA in nesting females. Three haplotypes were identified: CC-A4, CC-A24 and CC x LO. The last one was recorded for specimens considered hybrids because they represent L. olivacea's mtDNA, but had the external morphology of C. caretta or of a mixture of both species. Based on the two types of hybrids, it was hypothesized that at least two hybridization events had occurred: a more ancient hybridization event, accompanied by introgression (F2 or later backcrosses), and a recent one (F1), both of which involving the same L. olivacea haplotype. The incidence of L. olivacea mitochondrial genome introgression into the C. caretta rookeries was only observed in Sergipe, which could be related to the large numbers of L. olivacea in this region and an overlap of reproduction periods and distribution areas of both species. This may also be associated to global warming since it might alter the sex ratio of sea turtles, thus facilitating interspecific mating. Awareness of gene flow between these species will significantly influence the development and implementation of adequate management strategies.	2010	10.1007/s10592-009-9973-2		Reptiles	Testudines	Lepidochelys, Caretta	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Hofman, Sebastian; Szymura, Jacek M.	Limited mitochondrial DNA introgression in a Bombina hybrid zone	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	We analysed the variation at mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and six allozyme loci in two transects across a hybrid zone between the fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and Bombina variegata in southern Poland. The mtDNA cline was narrower than allozyme clines in one transect (Przemysl, beta = 0.435, w = 3.42 km) and shifted to the B. bombina side in both (near Krakow by 1.32 km, alpha = 0.437, and near Przemysl by 0.97 km, alpha = 0.319). Cytonuclear associations were weak. Narrowed mtDNA clines could be a by-product of female demography and lowered effective population size of mtDNA. Alternatively, restricted mtDNA introgression is a likely result of negative epistasis in recombinants augmented by environment-dependent selection because divergence of Bombina mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is large. The shift of the mtDNA cline, contrary to expectations from initial mating preferences and fecundity differences between the species, suggests that on the B. bombina side of the zone hybrid females with B. variegata mtDNA have a higher chance of leaving progeny.

Liu, Kui; Wang, Fang; Chen, Wei; Tu, Lihong; Min, Mi-Sook; Bi, Ke; Fu, Jinzhong	Rampant historical mitochondrial genome introgression between two species of green pond frogs, Pelophylax nigromaculatus and P. plancyi	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Mitochondrial introgression may result in the mitochondrial genome of one species being replaced by that of another species without leaving any trace of past hybridization in its nuclear genome. Such introgression can confuse the species genealogy estimates and lead to absurd inferences of species history. We used a phylogenetic approach to explore the potential mitochondrial genome introgression event(s) between two closely related green pond frog species, Pelophylax nigromaculatus and P. plancyi. Results: DNA sequence data of one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes from an extensive sampling of the two species were collected, and the genealogies of the three genes were constructed and compared. While the two nuclear genes congruently showed mutual reciprocal monophyly of both species, the mitochondrial phylogeny separated a Korean P. nigromaculatus clade, a paraphyletic central China P. plancyi assemblage, and a large well-supported introgression clade. Within the introgression clade, the mitochondrial haplotypes of the two species were mixed together. This reticulated pattern can be most parsimoniously explained by an ancient mitochondrial introgression event from P. plancyi to P. nigromaculatus that occurred at least 1.36 MYA, followed by multiple recent introgression events from P. nigromaculatus back to P. plancyi within the last 0.63 MY. The re-constitution of previously co-adapted genomes in P. plancyi may be responsible for the recent rampant introgression events. The Korean P. nigromaculatus clade likely represents the only surviving "true" mitochondrial lineage of P. nigromaculatus, and the central China P. plancyi assemblage likely represents the "original" P. plancyi mitochondrial lineage. Refugia in the Korean Peninsula and central China may have played a significant role in preserving these ancient lineages. Conclusions: The majority of individuals in the two species have either introgressed (P. nigromaculatus) or reclaimed (P. plancyi) mitochondrial genomes while no trace of past hybridization in their nuclear genomes was detected. Asymmetrical reproductive ability of hybrids and continuous backcrossing are likely responsible for the observed mitochondrial introgression. This case is unique in that it includes an ancient "forward" introgression and many recent "backward" introgressions, which re-constitutes the original nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of P. plancyi. This hybrid system provides an excellent opportunity to study cyto-nuclear interaction and co-adaptation.	2010	10.1186/1471-2148-10-201		Amphibian	Anura	Pelophylax	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	sanger (3 genes)	TRUE	
Ng, Julienne; Glor, Richard E.	Genetic differentiation among populations of a Hispaniolan trunk anole that exhibit geographical variation in dewlap colour	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Long neglected by classic island biogeographical theory, speciation within and among islands is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to insular diversity. Although the factors responsible for island speciation remain poorly understood, this process appears critically dependent on geographical variation and speciation in allopatry or parapatry. Here, we investigate geographical variation and speciation in a complex of Hispaniolan trunk anoles (Anolis distichus), where populations with strikingly distinct dewlap colours and patterns correspond with deeply divergent mtDNA structure. Using a multilocus, population-level analysis, we investigate whether these phenotypically and mitochondrially distinct populations exhibit the type of nuclear differentiation expected among species or incipient species. Along a transect that extends across a recently recessed marine barrier, our results are consistent with the persistence of an abrupt phenotypic and mitochondrial transition following secondary contact, in spite of little or no evidence for a reduction in nuclear gene flow. Along a second transect extending across a steep environmental gradient, our phenotypic and microsatellite data suggest a sharp genetic break with little or no admixture, whereas mtDNA recovers a signature of extensive unidirectional introgression. Together, these results are consistent with previous studies of Lesser Antillean anoles, suggesting that allopatric divergence alone is insufficient for speciation, whereas reduced gene flow and partial reproductive isolation may accumulate in the presence of ecological gradients.	2011	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05267.x		Reptiles	Squamata	Anolis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, STRUCTURE, trees	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites (11 loci)	TRUE

Widespread unidirectional transfer of mitochondrial DNA: a case in western Palaearctic water frogs	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Interspecies transfer of mitochondrial (mt) DNA is a common phenomenon in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, normally linked with hybridization of closely related species in zones of sympatry or parapatry. In central Europe, in an area north of 48 degrees N latitude and between 8 degrees and 22 degrees E longitude, western Palaearctic water frogs show massive unidirectional introgression of mtDNA: 33.7% of 407 Rana ridibunda possessed mtDNA specific for Rana lessonae. By contrast, no R. lessonae with R. ridibunda mtDNA was observed. That R. ridibunda with introgressed mitochondrial genomes were found exclusively within the range of the hybrid Rana esculenta and that most hybrids had lessonae mtDNA (90.4% of 335 individuals investigated) is evidence that R. esculenta serves as a vehicle for transfer of lessonae mtDNA into R. ridibunda. Such introgression has occurred several times independently. The abundance and wide distribution of individuals with introgressed mitochondrial genomes show that R. lessonae mt genomes work successfully in a R. ridibunda chromosomal background despite their high sequence divergence from R. ridibunda mtDNAs (14.2-15.2% in the ND2/ND3 genes). Greater effectiveness of enzymes encoded by R. lessonae mtDNA may be advantageous to individuals of R. ridibunda and probably R. esculenta in the northern parts of their ranges.	2008	10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01527.x		Amphibian	Anura	Rana	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (2 genes), RFLP ()	TRUE	
Lehtinen, Richard M.; Steratore, Anthony F.; Eyre, Meredith M.; Cassagnol, Emlyne S.; Stern, Mitchell L.; Edgington, Hilary A.	Identification of Widespread Hybridization between Two Terrestrial Salamanders Using Morphology, Coloration, and Molecular Markers	COPEIA	Since the advent of molecular tools, hybridization has increasingly been recognized as both a common and an evolutionarily important process. Using single nucleotide polymorphism markers from three nuclear genes, we investigated the extent of hybridization between two terrestrial salamanders (Plethodon cinereus and P. electromorphus) at 13 sites in northeastern Ohio, U.S.A. These markers indicated a high degree of gene flow and introgression in these two species (48 of 90 individuals genotyped were classified as hybrids using a Bayesian assignment algorithm). These hybrids included F-1 individuals and backcrosses to both species. These data as well as mitochondrial DNA sequences from hybrids suggest symmetrical hybridization. A multivariate analysis of standard morphological characters and coloration patterns from image analysis demonstrated that hybrids are intermediate in many ways. However, backcrosses proved difficult to separate from parentals, and the extent of hybridization would have been underestimated using morphology and coloration alone. Given the high frequency of hybrids and their broad geographic distribution, we speculate that these two lineages may be in the process of merging back into a single gene pool.	2016	10.1643/CH-14-205		Amphibian	Urodela	Plethodon	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, STRUCTURE	Sanger (3 genes)	TRUE

Chen, Wei; Bi, Ke; Fu, Jinzhong	Frequent mitochondrial gene introgression among high elevation Tibetan megophryid frogs revealed by conflicting gene genealogies	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Historical mitochondrial introgression causes differences between a species' mitochondrial gene genealogy and its nuclear gene genealogy, making tree-based species delineation ambiguous. Using sequence data from one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) and three nuclear genes (introns), we examined the evolutionary history of four high elevation Tibetan megophryid frog species, Scutiger boulengeri, Scutiger glandulatus, Scutiger mammatus and Scutiger tuberculatus. The three nuclear genes shared a similar history but the mitochondrial gene tree suggested a drastically different evolutionary scenario. The conflicts between them were explained by multiple episodes of mitochondrial introgression events via historical interspecific hybridization. 'Foreign' mitochondrial genomes might have been fixed in populations and extended through a large portion of the species' distribution. Some hybridization events were probably as old as 10 Myr, while others were recent. An F-1 hybrid was also identified. Historical hybridization events among the four species appeared to be persistent and were not restricted to the period of Pleistocene glaciation, as in several other well-studied cases. Furthermore, hybridization involved several species and occurred in multiple directions, and there was no indication of one mitochondrial genome being superior to others. In addition, incomplete lineage sorting resulting from budding speciation may have also explained some discrepancies between the mitochondrial DNA and nuclear gene trees. Combining all evidences, the former 'Scutiger mammatus' appeared to be two species, including a new species. With the availability of a wide range of highly variable nuclear gene markers, we recommend using a combination of mitochondrial gene and multiple nuclear genes to reveal a complete species history.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04258.x		Amphibian	Anura	Scutiger	TRUE	TRUE	only mtDNA	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE	
Denton, Robert D.; Morales, Ariadna E.; Gibbs, H. Lisle	Genome-specific histories of divergence and introgression between an allopolyploid unisexual salamander lineage and two ancestral sexual species	EVOLUTION	Quantifying introgression between sexual species and polyploid lineages traditionally thought to be asexual is an important step in understanding what drives the longevity of putatively asexual groups. Here, we capitalize on three recent innovations-ultraconserved element (UCE) sequencing, bioinformatic techniques for identifying genome-specific variation in polyploids, and model-based methods for evaluating historical gene flow-to measure the extent and tempo of introgression over the evolutionary history of an allopolyploid lineage of all-female salamanders and two ancestral sexual species. Our analyses support a scenario in which the genomes sampled in unisexual salananders last shared a common ancestor with genomes in their parental species similar to 3.4 million years ago, followed by a period of divergence between homologous genomes. Recently, secondary introgression has occurred at different times with each sexual species during the last 500,000 years. Sustained introgression of sexual genomes into the unisexual lineage is the defining characteristic of their reproductive mode, but this study provides the first evidence that unisexual genomes have undergone long periods of divergence without introgression. Unlike other sperm-dependent taxa in which introgression is rare, the alternating periods of divergence and introgression between unisexual salamanders and their sexual relatives could explain why these salamanders are among the oldest described unisexual animals.	2018	10.1111/evo.13528		Amphibian	Urodela	Ambystoma	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	demographic models	UCEs (5500)	TRUE

Assessing models of speciation under different biogeographic scenarios; an empirical study using multi-locus and RNA-seq analyses	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Evolutionary biology often seeks to decipher the drivers of speciation, and much debate persists over the relative importance of isolation and gene flow in the formation of new species. Genetic studies of closely related species can assess if gene flow was present during speciation, because signatures of past introgression often persist in the genome. We test hypotheses on which mechanisms of speciation drove diversity among three distinct lineages of desert tortoise in the genus Gopherus. These lineages offer a powerful system to study speciation, because different biogeographic patterns (physical vs. ecological segregation) are observed at opposing ends of their distributions. We use 82 samples collected from 38 sites, representing the entire species' distribution and generate sequence data for mtDNA and four nuclear loci. A multilocus phylogenetic analysis in *BEAST estimates the species tree. RNA-seq data yield 20,126 synonymous variants from 7665 contigs from two individuals of each of the three lineages. Analyses of these data using the demographic inference package ai serve to test the null hypothesis of no gene flow during divergence. The best-fit demographic model for the three taxa is concordant with the *BEAST species tree, and the ai analysis does not indicate gene flow among any of the three lineages during their divergence. These analyses suggest that divergence among the lineages occurred in the absence of gene flow and in this scenario the genetic signature of ecological isolation (parapatric model) cannot be differentiated from geographic isolation (allopatric model).	2016	10.1002/ece3.1865		Reptiles	Testudines	Gopherus	TRUE	TRUE	part of the mtDNA	TRUE	demographic models, trees	Sanger (5 genes), transcriptome (95 220 loci)	TRUE	
Freedberg, Steven; Myers, Erin M.	Cytonuclear equilibrium following interspecific introgression in a turtle lacking sex chromosomes	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	When reproductive barriers break down, interspecific hybridization can lead to gene flow between evolutionarily distinct species. Studying the fate of these introgressing elements can offer valuable insights into the factors contributing to reproductive isolation. We have identified a population of false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica) that hybridized historically with the common map turtle (Graptemys geographica), but were subsequently isolated from interbreeding for several generations by unique geological events. Although many studies conclude that genic interactions involving sex chromosomes impact the introgression of mitochondrial or nuclear genomes, Graptemys turtles have environmental sex determination, and thus introgression can be explored while controlling for the effects of sex-specific heterogameity. We identified and sequenced a species-specific mitochondrial control region marker, as well as two nuclear markers (ODC and HNFAL), in turtles from across the ranges of these species. We found both nuclear and mitochondrial introgression in our study population, and present evidence consistent with the proposed time range of reproductive contact and isolation. We also report an absence of cytonuclear or linkage disequilibrium among markers, indicating that some important pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene flow that characterize other systems are absent in Graptemys. Finally, we show that Graptemys turtles have a complex molecular evolutionary history, and that leaks in reproductive barriers probably occur frequently.

Haenel, Gregory J.	Introgression of mtDNA in Urosaurus lizards: historical and ecological processes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Introgression of mtDNA appears common in animals, but the implications of acquiring a novel mitochondrial genome are not well known. This study investigates mito-genome introgression between the lizard species Urosaurus graciosus, a thermal specialist, and U.ornatus, a species that occupies a wider range of thermal environments. As ectotherms, their metabolic rate is strongly influenced by the thermal environment; with mitochondria being linked to metabolic rates, overall energy budgets could be impacted by introgression. I use mitochondrial gene trees, inferred from Bayesian analyses of Cyt-B and ND1 gene sequences, along with morphology and microsatellites from nineteen populations of these two species to address if the direction and location of mito-nuclear discordance match predictions of introgression resulting from past population expansions. MtDNA is expected to move from resident species into expanding or invading species. Second, does having a heterospecific form of mitochondria impact body size, a trait strongly associated with fitness? Multiple independent introgression events of historic origin were detected. All introgression was unidirectional with U.ornatus-type mtDNA found in U.graciosus parental type individuals. This result was consistent with population expansions detected in U.graciosus but not U.ornatus. Females with heterospecific mtDNA were significantly smaller than homospecific forms, and heterospecific males had a different relationship of body mass to body length than those with homospecific mtDNA. These changes indicate a potential selective disadvantage for individuals with heterospecific mitochondria and are consistent with the theoretical expectation that deleterious alleles are more likely to persist in expanding populations.	2017	10.1111/mec.13930		Reptiles	Squamata	Urosaurus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of intrest, microsatellites, and mtDNA	TRUE	phylogentic analyses, Fst, STRUCTURE, and morpholgical analyses 	Sanger (2 genes), microsattelites	TRUE	
Spinks, Phillip Q.; Shaffer, H. Bradley	Conservation phylogenetics of the Asian box turtles (Geoemydidae, Cuora): mitochondrial introgression, numts, and inferences from multiple nuclear loci	CONSERVATION GENETICS	Asian box turtles (genus Cuora, family Geoemydidae) comprise a clade of 12 aquatic and semiaquatic nominate species distributed across southern China and Southeast Asia. Over the last two decades, turtles throughout Asia have been harvested at an unsustainable rate to satisfy demands for food, traditional Chinese medicine, and the pet trade. Consequently, all species of Cuora were recently placed on the IUCN Red List, nine are currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, and all species are listed in Appendix II of CITES. We compiled a 67-specimen mitochondrial (similar to 1,650 base pairs (bp) from two mitochondrial genes) and a 40-specimen nuclear-plus-mitochondrial (-3,900 bp total, three nuclear introns plus an additional similar to 860 bp mitochondrial gene fragment) DNA data set to reconstruct the phylogeny of Cuora species and to assess genetic diversity and species boundaries for several of the most problematic taxa. Our sampling included 23 C. trifasciata, 17 C. zhoui and 1-4 individuals of the remaining 10 species of Cuora. Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses all recovered similar, well resolved trees. Within the Cuora clade, mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data indicated that both C. zhoui and C. mccordi represent old lineages with little or no history of interspecific gene flow, suggesting that they are good genealogical species. Based on mtDNA, Cuora pani was paraphyletic and C. trifasciata was composed of two highly divergent lineages that were not each other's closest relatives; both cases of non-monophyly were due to a mtDNA sequence that was widespread and identical in C. aurocapitata, C. pani and C. trifasciata. However, when combined with nuclear DNA results, our data indicate that C. trifasciata is a single, monophyletic taxon, and that mitochondrial introgression and nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes have led to a complex pattern of mitochondrial gene relationships that does not reflect species-level histories. Our results imply that captive "assurance colonies" of both C. trifasciata and C. pani should be genotyped to identify pure, non-hybrid members of both taxa, and we recommend that introgressed and pure taxa be managed as independent entities until the full evolutionary histories of these critically endangered turtles are resolved.	2007	10.1007/s10592-006-9210-1		Reptiles	Testudines	Cuora	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (13 genes)	TRUE

Moseley, Matthew A.; Cox, Christian L.; Streicher, Jeffrey W.; Roelke, Corey E.; Chippindale, Paul T.	Phylogeography and lineage-specific patterns of genetic diversity and molecular evolution in a group of North American skinks	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Geography influences the evolutionary trajectory of species by mediating opportunities for hybridization, gene flow, demographic shifts and adaptation. We sought to understand how geography and introgression can generate species-specific patterns of genetic diversity by examining phylogeographical relationships in the North American skink species Plestiodon multivirgatus and P.tetragrammus (Squamata: Scincidae). Using a multilocus dataset (three mitochondrial genes, four nuclear genes; a total of 3455bp) we discovered mito-nuclear discordance, consistent with mtDNA introgression. We further tested for evidence of species-wide mtDNA introgression by using comparisons of genetic diversity, selection tests and extended Bayesian skyline analyses. Our findings suggest that P.multivirgatus acquired its mitochondrial genome from P.tetragrammus after their initial divergence. This putative species-wide mitochondrial capture was further evidenced by statistically indistinguishable substitution rates between mtDNA and nDNA in P.multivirgatus. This rate discrepancy was observed in P.multivirgatus but not P.tetragrammus, which has important implications for studies that combine mtDNA and nDNA sequences when inferring time since divergence between taxa. Our findings suggest that by facilitating opportunities for interspecific introgression, geography can alter the course of molecular evolution between recently diverged lineages.	2015	10.1111/bij.12626		Reptiles	Squamata	Plestiodon	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees, demography	Sanger (6 genes)	TRUE	
Dufresnes, Christophe; Brelsford, Alan; Crnobrnja-Isailovic, Jelka; Tzankov, Nikolay; Nicolas, Petros Lymberakis; Perrin, Nicolas	Timeframe of speciation inferred from secondary contact zones in the European tree frog radiation (Hyla arborea group)	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Hybridization between incipient species is expected to become progressively limited as their genetic divergence increases and reproductive isolation proceeds. Amphibian radiations and their secondary contact zones are useful models to infer the timeframes of speciation, but empirical data from natural systems remains extremely scarce. Here we follow this approach in the European radiation of tree frogs (Hyla arborea group). We investigated a natural hybrid zone between two lineages (Hyla arborea and Hyla orientalis) of Mio-Pliocene divergence (similar to 5 My) for comparison with other hybrid systems from this group. Results: We found concordant geographic distributions of nuclear and mitochondrial gene pools, and replicated narrow transitions (similar to 30 km) across two independent transects, indicating an advanced state of reproductive isolation and potential local barriers to dispersal. This result parallels the situation between H. arborea and H. intermedia, which share the same amount of divergence with H. orientalis. In contrast, younger lineages show much stronger admixture at secondary contacts. Conclusions: Our findings corroborate the negative relationship between hybridizability and divergence time in European tree frogs, where 5 My are necessary to achieve almost complete reproductive isolation. Speciation seems to progress homogeneously in this radiation, and might thus be driven by gradual genome-wide changes rather than single speciation genes. However, the timescale differs greatly from that of other well-studied amphibians. General assumptions on the time necessary for speciation based on evidence from unrelated taxa may thus be unreliable. In contrast, comparative hybrid zone analyses within single radiations such as our case study are useful to appreciate the advance of speciation in space and time.	2015	10.1186/s12862-015-0385-2		Amphibian	Anura	Hyla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites (23 loci)	TRUE	
Dufresnes, Christophe; Pellet, Jerome; Bettinelli-Riccardi, Sandra; Thiebaud, Jacques; Perrin, Nicolas; Fumagalli, Luca	Massive genetic introgression in threatened northern crested newts (Triturus cristatus) by an invasive congener (T-carnifex) in Western Switzerland	CONSERVATION GENETICS	Genetic pollution through introgressive hybridization of local species by exotic relatives is a major, yet neglected aspect of biological invasions, particularly in amphibians where human introductions are frequent. In Western Switzerland, crested newts make an interesting case: the Italian species Triturus carnifex was introduced at least a century ago within the range of the native and threatened T. cristatus. To understand the genetic consequences of this introduction and inform wildlife management authorities, we conducted a genetic survey on the remaining northern crested newt populations known in the area, using newly-developed species-diagnostic nuclear (microsatellites) and mitochondrial (control region) DNA markers. We documented massive nuclear introgression by the T. carnifex genome, which has completely replaced T. cristatus in most populations, especially in the Geneva area where the introduction was originally reported. However, many of these individuals retained the ancestral T. cristatus mtDNA, which could be explained by asymmetric introgression between the two species, stemming from demographic and/or selective processes. Analyses of genetic diversity support multiple events of T. carnifex releases, most-likely of proximate North Italian origin. We pinpointed the last indigenous populations in the region and recommend to prioritize their protection. Our study demonstrates the invasive potential of introduced taxa through introgressive hybridization, alerts about the underestimated rate of illegal amphibian translocations, and emphasizes the need for genetic analyses to monitor such invasions.	2016	10.1007/s10592-016-0825-6		Amphibian	Urodela	Triturus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees	microsattelites (11 loci)	TRUE

Colliard, Caroline; Sicilia, Alessandra; Turrisi, Giuseppe Fabrizio; Arculeo, Marco; Perrin, Nicolas; Stoeck, Matthias	Strong reproductive barriers in a narrow hybrid zone of West-Mediterranean green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup) with Plio-Pleistocene divergence	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: One key question in evolutionary biology deals with the mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during allopatric speciation. Little is known about secondary contacts of recently diverged anuran species. Here we conduct a multi-locus field study to investigate a contact zone between two lineages of green toads with an estimated divergence time of 2.7 My, and report results from preliminary experimental crosses. Results: The Sicilian endemic Bufo siculus and the Italian mainland-origin B. balearicus form a narrow hybrid zone east of Mt. Etna. Despite bidirectional mtDNA introgression over a ca. 40 km North-South cline, no F-1 hybrids could be found, and nuclear genomes display almost no admixture. Populations from each side of the contact zone showed depressed genetic diversity and very strong differentiation (F-ST = 0.52). Preliminary experimental crosses point to a slightly reduced fitness in F-1 hybrids, a strong hybrid breakdown in backcrossed offspring (F-1 x parental, with very few reaching metamorphosis) and a complete and early mortality in F-2 (F-1 x F-1). Conclusion: Genetic patterns at the contact zone are molded by drift and selection. Local effective sizes are reduced by the geography and history of the contact zone, B. balearicus populations being at the front wave of a recent expansion (late Pleistocene). Selection against hybrids likely results from intrinsic genomic causes (disruption of coadapted sets of genes in backcrosses and F-2-hybrids), possibly reinforced by local adaptation (the ranges of the two taxa roughly coincide with the borders of semiarid and arid climates). The absence of F-1 in the field might be due to premating isolation mechanisms. Our results, show that these lineages have evolved almost complete reproductive isolation after some 2.7 My of divergence, contrasting sharply with evidence from laboratory experiments that some anuran species may still produce viable F-1 offspring after > 20 My of divergence.	2010	10.1186/1471-2148-10-232		Amphibian	Anura	Bufo	TRUE	TRUE	expieremntal crosses	TRUE	STRUCTURE, Fst, PCA, trees	Sanger (3 genes)	TRUE	
Canestrelli, Daniele; Bisconti, Roberta; Nascetti, Giuseppe	Extensive unidirectional introgression between two salamander lineages of ancient divergence and its evolutionary implications	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	Hybridization and introgression, contrary to previous beliefs, are now considered to be widespread processes even among animal species. Nonetheless, the range of their possible outcomes and roles in moulding biodiversity patterns are still far from being fully appraised. Here we investigated the pattern of hybridization and introgression between Salamandrina perspicillata and S. terdigitata, two salamanders endemic to the Italian peninsula. Using a set of diagnostic or differentiated genetic markers (9 nuclear and 1 mitochondrial), we documented extensive unidirectional introgression of S. terdigitata alleles into the S. perspicillata gene pool in central Italy, indicating that barriers against hybridization were permeable when they came into secondary contact, and despite their ancient divergence. Nonetheless, purebred S. terdigitata, as well as F1, F2, and backcrosses were not found within the hybrid zone. Moreover, Bayesian analyses of population structure identified admixed populations belonging to a differentiated gene pool with respect to both parental populations. Overall, the observed genetic structure, together with their geographic pattern of distribution, suggests that Salamandrina populations in central Italy could have entered a distinct evolutionary pathway. How far they have gone along this pathway will deserve future investigation.	2014	10.1038/srep06516		Amphibian	Urodela	Salamandrina	TRUE	TRUE	only markers 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, Fst, and NewHybrid	Sanger (9 genes)	TRUE

They involve temporal, habitat or behavioral isolation acting before fertilization, and postzygotic isolation manifested as hybrid mortality or sterility. One of the approaches of how to study reproductive isolation barriers is through the analysis of hybrid zones. In this paper, we describe the structure of a hybrid zone between two crested newt species (Triturus cristatus and T. carnifex) in the southern part of the Czech Republic using morphological, microsatellite, and mitochondrial (mtDNA) markers. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the structure of the hybrid zone is maintained by species-specific habitat preferences. Comparing the genetic structure of populations with geographical and ecological parameters, we found that the hybrid zone was structured primarily geographically, with T. cristatus-like populations occurring in the northeast and T. carnifex-like populations in the southwest. Despite T. cristatus tending to occur in deeper ponds and T. carnifex on localities with more shading, the effect of both ecological parameters on the structure of the zone was minimal. Next, we corroborated that T. carnifex individuals and some hybrids possess mtDNA of T. dobrogicus, whose nuclear background was not detected in the studied hybrid zone. Hybridization between T. carnifex and T. dobrogicus (resulting in unidirectional mtDNA introgression) had to predate subsequent formation of the hybrid zone between T. cristatus and T. carnifex. Populations of crested newts in the southern part of the Czech Republic thus represent a genetic mosaic of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of three species.	2019	10.1002/ece3.5683		Amphibian	Urodela	Triturus	TRUE	TRUE	mtDNA and no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, Fst, Heterozygosity, clines 	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites (7 loci)	TRUE

Identifying hybridization and admixture using SNPs: application of the DArTseq platform in phylogeographic research on vertebrates	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are increasingly being used to generate multi-locus data for phylogeographic and evolutionary genetics research. We detail the applicability of a restriction enzyme-mediated genome complexity reduction approach with subsequent NGS (DArTseq) in vertebrate study systems at different evolutionary and geographical scales. We present two case studies using SNP data from the DArTseq molecular marker platform. First, we used DArTseq in a large phylogeographic study of the agamid lizard Ctenophorus caudicinctus, including 91 individuals and spanning the geographical range of this species across arid Australia. A low-density DArTseq assay resulted in 28 960 SNPs, with low density referring to a comparably reduced set of identified and sequenced markers as a costeffective approach. Second, we applied this approach to an evolutionary genetics study of a classic frog hybrid zone (Litoria ewingii-Litoria paraewingi) across 93 individuals, which resulted in 48 117 and 67 060 SNPs for a low-and high-density assay, respectively. We provide a docker-based workflow to facilitate data preparation and analysis, then analyse SNP data using multiple methods including Bayesian model-based clustering and conditional likelihood approaches. Based on comparison of results from the DArTseq platform and traditional molecular approaches, we conclude that DArTseq can be used successfully in vertebrates and will be of particular interest to researchers working at the interface between population genetics and phylogenetics, exploring species boundaries, gene exchange and hybridization.	2017	10.1098/rsos.161061		Reptiles	Squamata, Anura	Ctenophora, Litoria	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	fastSTRUCTURE, PCA, trees	GBS (50000 loci)	TRUE	
Mila, Borja; Surget-Groba, Yann; Heulin, Benoit; Gosa, Alberto; Fitze, Patrick S.	Multilocus phylogeography of the common lizard Zootoca vivipara at the Ibero-Pyrenean suture zone reveals lowland barriers and high-elevation introgression	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: The geographic distribution of evolutionary lineages and the patterns of gene flow upon secondary contact provide insight into the process of divergence and speciation. We explore the evolutionary history of the common lizard Zootoca vivipara (= Lacerta vivipara) in the Iberian Peninsula and test the role of the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains in restricting gene flow and driving lineage isolation and divergence. We also assess patterns of introgression among lineages upon secondary contact, and test for the role of high-elevation trans-mountain colonisations in explaining spatial patterns of genetic diversity. We use mtDNA sequence data and genome-wide AFLP loci to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among lineages, and measure genetic structure. Results: The main genetic split in mtDNA corresponds generally to the French and Spanish sides of the Pyrenees as previously reported, in contrast to genome-wide AFLP data, which show a major division between NW Spain and the rest. Both types of markers support the existence of four distinct and geographically congruent genetic groups, which are consistent with major topographic barriers. Both datasets reveal the presence of three independent contact zones between lineages in the Pyrenean region, one in the Basque lowlands, one in the low-elevation mountains of the western Pyrenees, and one in the French side of the central Pyrenees. The latter shows genetic evidence of a recent, high-altitude trans-Pyrenean incursion from Spain into France. Conclusions: The distribution and age of major lineages is consistent with a Pleistocene origin and a role for both the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains in driving isolation and differentiation of Z. vivipara lineages at large geographic scales. However, mountain ranges are not always effective barriers to dispersal, and have not prevented a recent high-elevation trans-Pyrenean incursion that has led to asymmetrical introgression among divergent lineages. Cytonuclear discordance in patterns of genetic structure and introgression at contact zones suggests selection may be involved at various scales. Suture zones are important areas for the study of lineage formation and speciation, and our results show that biogeographic barriers can yield markedly different phylogeographic patterns in different vertebrate and invertebrate taxa.	2013	10.1186/1471-2148-13-192		Reptiles	Squamata	Zootoca	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE	
Singhal, Sonal; Bi, Ke	History cleans up messes: The impact of time in driving divergence and introgression in a tropical suture zone	EVOLUTION	Contact zones provide an excellent arena in which to address questions about how genomic divergence evolves during lineage divergence. They allow us to both infer patterns of genomic divergence in allopatric populations isolated from introgression and to characterize patterns of introgression after lineages meet. Thusly motivated, we analyze genome-wide introgression data from four contact zones in three genera of lizards endemic to the Australian Wet Tropics. These contact zones all formed between morphologically cryptic lineage-pairs within morphologically defined species, and the lineage-pairs meeting in the contact zones diverged anywhere from 3.1 to 5.8 million years ago. By characterizing patterns of molecular divergence across an average of 11K genes and fitting geographic clines to an average of 7.5K variants, we characterize how patterns of genomic differentiation and introgression change through time. Across this range of divergences, we find that genome-wide differentiation increases but becomes no less heterogeneous. In contrast, we find that introgression heterogeneity decreases dramatically, suggesting that time helps isolated genomes congeal. Thus, this work emphasizes the pivotal role that history plays in driving lineage divergence.	2017	10.1111/evo.13278		Reptiles	Squamata	Lampropholis, Saprosincus, Carlia	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	Sequence similarity, LD	exome (57000 loci)	TRUE

B.; Barrio-Amoros, Cesar; Ibanez, Roberto; Faivovich, Julian	Phylogenetic relationships of toads of the Rhinella granulosa group (Anura: Bufonidae): a molecular perspective with comments on hybridization and introgression	CLADISTICS	The Rhinella granulosa group consists of 13 species of toads distributed throughout open areas of South America and Panama. In this paper we perform a phylogenetic analysis considering all but one species of the group, employing five nuclear and four mitochondrial genes, for up to 7910 bp per specimen. Separate phylogenetic analyses under direct optimization (DO) of nuclear and mitochondrial sequences recovered the R. granulosa group as monophyletic and revealed topological incongruence that can be explained mainly by multiple events of hybridization and introgression, both mitochondrial and nuclear. The DO combined analysis, after the exclusion of putatively introgressed or heterozygous genomes, resulted in a phylogenetic hypothesis for the R. granulosa group in which most of the species are recovered as monophyletic, but with interspecific relationships poorly supported. The optimization of morphological (adult and larval), chromosomal, and behavioural characters resulted in 12 putative phenotypic synapomorphies for this species group and some other synapomorphies for internal clades. Our results indicate the need for additional population genetic studies on R. dorbignyi and R. fernandezae to corroborate the taxonomic status of both taxa. Finally, we discuss biological and genetic characteristics of Bufonidae, as possible explanations for the common occurrence of hybridization and introgression observed in some lineages of this family.

No evidence for nuclear introgression despite complete mtDNA replacement in the Carpathian newt (Lissotriton montandoni)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Patterns of interspecific introgression may vary geographically, and the distribution of introgressed variants can yield insight into the historical dynamics of genetic interactions between hybridizing species. Urodele amphibians, often characterized by limited mobility, deep intraspecific genetic structuring and vulnerability to climatic changes, constitute suitable models for such historical inferences. Here, we combine an extensive survey of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (15 microsatellites) genomes in the Carpathian newt, Lissotriton montandoni (Lm) with species distribution modelling (SDM). Populations of the smooth newt, L.vulgaris (Lv) from the areas surrounding the Lm range were also sampled to test whether gene flow between these hybridizing species extends beyond the area of strict syntopy. The extent of introgression differs dramatically between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome. While multiple, spatially and temporally distinct introgression events from Lv resulted in complete mtDNA replacement in Lm, there was little evidence of recent interspecific nuclear gene flow in the assayed markers. Microsatellite differentiation within Lm defines three units, probably derived from separate glacial refugia, located in the northern, eastern and southern part of the Carpathians. In situ survival and range fragmentation of Lm are supported by SDM, corroborating the role of the Carpathians as a major refugial area. Our results, in combination with previous reports of extensive introgression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, emphasize the complexity of historical gene exchange between Lm and Lv.	2013	10.1111/mec.12225		Amphibian	Urodela	Lissotriton	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	PCA, STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, trees	microsattelites (16 loci), Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE

Butterfly genome reveals promiscuous exchange of mimicry adaptations among species	NATURE	The evolutionary importance of hybridization and introgression has long been debated(1). Hybrids are usually rare and unfit, but even infrequent hybridization can aid adaptation by transferring beneficial traits between species. Here we use genomic tools to investigate introgression in Heliconius, a rapidly radiating genus of neotropical butterflies widely used in studies of ecology, behaviour, mimicry and speciation(2-5). We sequenced the genome of Heliconius melpomene and compared it with other taxa to investigate chromosomal evolution in Lepidoptera and gene flow among multiple Heliconius species and races. Among 12,669 predicted genes, biologically important expansions of families of chemosensory and Hox genes are particularly noteworthy. Chromosomal organization has remained broadly conserved since the Cretaceous period, when butterflies split from the Bombyx (silkmoth) lineage. Using genomic resequencing, we show hybrid exchange of genes between three co-mimics, Heliconius melpomene, Heliconius timareta and Heliconius elevatus, especially at two genomic regions that control mimicry pattern. We infer that closely related Heliconius species exchange protective colour-pattern genes promiscuously, implying that hybridization has an important role in adaptive radiation.	2012	10.1038/nature11041		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	TRUE	Didn't provide values just a figire	TRUE	sequence similairty, Patterson's D, PHYML	WGS, RAD, sequence capture	TRUE	
Dussex, Nicolas; Chuah, Aaron; Waters, Jonathan M.	Genome-wide SNPs reveal fine-scale differentiation among wingless alpine stonefly populations and introgression between winged and wingless forms	EVOLUTION	Insect flight loss is a repeated phenomenon in alpine habitats, where wing reduction is thought to enhance local recruitment and increase fecundity. One predicted consequence of flight loss is reduced dispersal ability, which should lead to population genetic differentiation and perhaps ultimately to speciation. Using a dataset of 15,123 SNP loci, we present comparative analyses of fine-scale population structure in codistributed Zelandoperla stonefly species, across three parallel altitudinal transects in New Zealand's Rock and Pillar mountain range. We find that winged populations (altitude 200-500 m; Zelandoperla decorata) show no genetic structuring within or among streams, suggesting substantial dispersal mediated by flight. By contrast, wingless populations (Zelandoperla fenestrata; altitude 200-1100 m) exhibit distinct genetic clusters associated with each stream, and additional evidence of isolation by distance within streams. Our data support the hypothesis that wing-loss can initiate diversification in alpine insect populations over small spatial scales. The often deep phylogenetic placement of lowland Z. fenestrata within their stream-specific clades suggests the possibility of independent alpine colonization events for each stream. Additionally, the detection of winged, interspecific hybrid individuals raises the intriguing possibility that a previously flightless lineage could reacquire flight via introgression.	2016	10.1111/evo.12826		Insects	Plecoptera	Zelandoperla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	PCoA, PUAP, FST, fastSTRUCTURE	mtDNA (1 gene), GBS (15123 snps)	TRUE

Gerth, Michael; Geissler, Annemarie; Bleidorn, Christoph	Wolbachia infections in bees (Anthophila) and possible implications for DNA barcoding	SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY	The widespread intracellular bacterium Wolbachia is transmitted exclusively maternally and alters the reproduction of its hosts by different mechanisms. Thereby, inheritance patterns of mitochondrial genomes are modified, possibly confining interpretations of mitochondrial sequence data. Although this phenomenon has been reported before, its conclusions seem to be widely ignored. In the light of recent large-scale barcoding projects relying solely on mitochondrial cox1 sequences, we screened the native German bee fauna (Anthophila) for Wolbachia infections. The screening revealed that 66% of the native German bees and 54% of sphecid wasps are infected by Wolbachia. Many species bore identical or similar infections, suggesting a high rate of horizontal transfer. Supergroup A infections were recovered in most cases; only one species bore a super-group F Wolbachia infection. Because Wolbachia is not only present in 66% of bees but also in the majority of arthropod species, we argue that studies interpreting sequence data of arthropod species cannot rely on mitochondrial data alone - nuclear markers must be incorporated. DNA barcoding using only mitochondrial cox1 will not be sufficient to delimit, identify or discover Wolbachia-infected species, i.e. probably the majority of all animal species.	2011	10.1080/14772000.2011.627953		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	did not investigate introgression	FALSE			TRUE

Gomez-Zurita, J; Vogler, AP	Testing introgressive hybridization hypotheses using statistical network analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic haplotypes in the leaf beetle Timarcha goettingensis species complex	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION	Previous studies of leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) in the Timarcha goettingensis species complex using mitochondrial (cox2) and nuclear (ITS-2 rRNA) markers revealed two main clades confined to the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe but showing incongruent distributions indicative of gene exchange between both groups. Because of the anastomosing nature of hybridization, which disrupts the cladistic structure of character variation, phylogenetic trees might be inappropriate to represent and study this process. Here we test for evidence of hybridization in the T. goettingensis complex by analyzing the extra homoplasy arising in hybrid genomes from the simultaneous analysis of genetically independent markers. Haplotype networks obtained by Templeton's statistical parsimony analysis were generated for combined (concatenated) cox2 and ITS-2 sequences from 167 individuals of the T. goettingensis complex. Networks were used to detect runs of homoplasious characters physically clustered along a nucleotide sequence, as evidence for recombination between both gene partitions. A hypergeometric tail probability for the chance occurrence of physically clustered character changes on the connections linking networks of genotypes was applied. The test recognized two instances of statistically significant clustering, indicating the presence of cox2-ITS-2 mosaic genotypes and reticulation of both main T. goettingensis clades, supporting the reticulate origin of samples of T. maritima in southwestern France and T. sinuatocollis/T. monserratensis in the eastern Pyrenees. Although the assessment of reticulation in DNA sequences does not provide direct proof for hybridization, the geographical distribution of mosaic genotypes in the vicinity of "pure" genotypes supports the effect of gene flow between the two divergent lineages. The study demonstrates the utility of statistical parsimony networks for the detection of hybrids in the growing number of phylogeographic studies based on multiple gene markers.	2006	10.1007/s00239-004-0329-8		Insects	Coleoptera	Timarcha	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	genotype networks, PUAP	mtDNA (1 gene), Nuclear marker (1 gene)	TRUE	
Gompert, Zachariah; Forister, Matthew L.; Fordyce, James A.; Nice, Chris C.	Widespread mito-nuclear discordance with evidence for introgressive hybridization and selective sweeps in Lycaeides	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	We investigated the extent and potential cause(s) of mitochondrial introgression within the polytypic North American Lycaeides species complex (Lepidoptera). By comparing population genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA (COI and COII) and nuclear DNA (251 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers), we detected substantial mito-nuclear discordance, primarily involving a single mitochondrial haplotype (h01), which is likely due to mitochondrial introgression between differentiated Lycaeides populations and/or species. We detected reduced mitochondrial genetic diversity relative to nuclear genetic diversity in populations where mitochondrial haplotype h01 occurs, suggesting that the spread of this haplotype was facilitated by selection. We found no evidence that haplotype h01 is associated with increased fitness (in terms of survival to eclosion, fresh adult weight, and adult longevity) in a polymorphic Lycaeides melissa population. However, we did find a positive association between mitochondrial haplotype h01 and infection by the endoparasitic bacterium Wolbachia in one out of three lineages tested. Linkage disequilibrium between mitochondrial haplotype h01 and Wolbachia infection status may have resulted in indirect selection favouring the spread of haplotype h01 in at least one lineage of North American Lycaeides. These results illustrate the potential for introgressive hybridization to produce substantial mito-nuclear discordance and demonstrate that an individual's mitochondrial and nuclear genome may have strikingly different evolutionary histories resulting from non-neutral processes and intrinsic differences in the inheritance and biology of these genomes.	2008	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03988.x		Insects	Lepidoptera	Lycaeides	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	spatial analysis, STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	mtDNA (2 genes), AFLP (251 markers)	TRUE	
Gompert, Zachariah; Lucas, Lauren K.; Nice, Chris C.; Buerkle, C. Alex	GENOME DIVERGENCE AND THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF BARRIERS TO GENE FLOW BETWEEN LYCAEIDES IDAS AND L-MELISSA	EVOLUTION	Genome divergence during speciation is a dynamic process that is affected by various factors, including the genetic architecture of barriers to gene flow. Herein we quantitatively describe aspects of the genetic architecture of two sets of traits, male genitalic morphology and oviposition preference, that putatively function as barriers to gene flow between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa. Our analyses are based on unmapped DNA sequence data and a recently developed Bayesian regression approach that includes variable selection and explicit parameters for the genetic architecture of traits. A modest number of nucleotide polymorphisms explained a small to large proportion of the variation in each trait, and average genetic variant effects were nonnegligible. Several genetic regions were associated with variation in multiple traits or with trait variation within- and among-populations. In some instances, genetic regions associated with trait variation also exhibited exceptional genetic differentiation between species or exceptional introgression in hybrids. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that divergent selection on male genitalia has contributed to heterogeneous genetic differentiation, and that both sets of traits affect fitness in hybrids. Although these results are encouraging, we highlight several difficulties related to understanding the genetics of speciation.	2013	10.1111/evo.12021		Insects	Lepidoptera	Lycaeides	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	morphological data, sequence similarity, genetic region by trait association	RAD (119677 snps)	TRUE

Alex	GENOMIC REGIONS WITH A HISTORY OF DIVERGENT SELECTION AFFECT FITNESS OF HYBRIDS BETWEEN TWO BUTTERFLY SPECIES	EVOLUTION	Speciation is the process by which reproductively isolated lineages arise, and is one of the fundamental means by which the diversity of life increases. Whereas numerous studies have documented an association between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation, relatively little is known about the role of natural selection in genome divergence during the process of speciation. Here, we use genome-wide DNA sequences and Bayesian models to test the hypothesis that loci under divergent selection between two butterfly species (Lycaeides idas and L. melissa) also affect fitness in an admixed population. Locus-specific measures of genetic differentiation between L. idas and L. melissa and genomic introgression in hybrids varied across the genome. The most differentiated genetic regions were characterized by elevated L. idas ancestry in the admixed population, which occurs in L. idas-like habitat, consistent with the hypothesis that local adaptation contributes to speciation. Moreover, locus-specific measures of genetic differentiation (a metric of divergent selection) were positively associated with extreme genomic introgression (a metric of hybrid fitness). Interestingly, concordance of differentiation and introgression was only partial. We discuss multiple, complementary explanations for this partial concordance.	2012	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01587.x		Insects	Lepidoptera	Lycaeides	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	Fst, PCA, cline analysis, hybrid index, sequence similarity	RAD (119677 snps)	TRUE	
Herrig, Danielle K.; Modrick, Alec J.; Brud, Evgeny; Llopart, Ana	INTROGRESSION IN THE DROSOPHILA SUBOBSCURA-D. MADEIRENSIS SISTER SPECIES: EVIDENCE OF GENE FLOW IN NUCLEAR GENES DESPITE MITOCHONDRIAL DIFFERENTIATION	EVOLUTION	Species hybridization, and thus the potential for gene flow, was once viewed as reproductive mistake. However, recent analysis based on large datasets and newly developed models suggest that gene exchange is not as rare as originally suspected. To investigate the history and speciation of the closely related species Drosophila subobscura, D. madeirensis, and D. guanche, we obtained polymorphism and divergence data for 26 regions throughout the genome, including the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. We found that the D. subobscura X/autosome ratio of silent nucleotide diversity is significantly smaller than the 0.75 expected under neutrality. This pattern, if held genomewide, may reflect a faster accumulation of beneficial mutations on the X chromosome than on autosomes. We also detected evidence of gene flow in autosomal regions, while sex chromosomes remain distinct. This is consistent with the large X effect on hybrid male sterility seen in this system and the presence of two X chromosome inversions fixed between species. Overall, our data conform to chromosomal speciation models in which rearrangements are proposed to serve as gene flow barriers. Contrary to other observations in Drosophila, the mitochondrial genome appears resilient to gene flow in the presence of nuclear exchange.	2014	10.1111/evo.12295		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	MEGA, substituion rates, IMa2, MK test, sequence similarity	Sanger (16 genes), Y-Chr (4 genes), mtDNA (5 genes)	TRUE

Differential gene flow of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers among chromosomal races of Australian morabine grasshoppers (Vandiemenella, viatica species group)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Recent theoretical developments have led to a renewed interest in the potential role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation. Australian morabine grasshoppers (genus Vandiemenella, viatica species group) provide an excellent study system to test this potential role of chromosomal rearrangements because they show extensive chromosomal variation and formed the basis of a classic chromosomal speciation model. There are three chromosomal races, viatica19, viatica17, and P24(XY), on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, forming five parapatric populations with four putative contact zones among them. We investigate the extent to which chromosomal variation among these populations may be associated with barriers to gene flow. Population genetic and phylogeographical analyses using 15 variable allozyme loci and the elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) gene indicate that the three races represent genetically distinct taxa. In contrast, analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene show the presence of three distinctive and geographically localized groups that do not correspond with the distribution of the chromosomal races. These discordant population genetic patterns are likely to result from introgressive hybridization between the chromosomal races and range expansions/contractions. Overall, these results suggest that reduction of nuclear gene flow may be associated with chromosomal variation, or underlying genetic variation linked with chromosomal variation, whereas mitochondrial gene flow appears to be independent of this variation in these morabine grasshoppers. The identification of an intact contact zone between P24(XY) and viatica17 offers considerable potential for further investigation of molecular mechanisms that maintain distinct nuclear genomes among the chromosomal races.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03572.x		Insects	Orthoptera	Vandiemenella	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees, demographic inference	Allozyme (15 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE

GENETIC ANALYSIS OF A CHROMOSOMAL HYBRID ZONE IN THE AUSTRALIAN MORABINE GRASSHOPPERS (VANDIEMENELLA, VIATICA SPECIES GROUP)	EVOLUTION	Whether chromosomal rearrangements promote speciation by providing barriers to gene exchange between populations is one of the long-standing debates in evolutionary biology. This question can be addressed by studying patterns of gene flow and selection in hybrid zones between chromosomally diverse taxa. Here we present results of the first study of the genetic structure of a hybrid zone between chromosomal races of morabine grasshoppers Vandiemenella viatica, P24(XY) and viatica17, on Kangaroo Island, Australia. Chromosomal and 11 nuclear markers revealed a narrow hybrid zone with strong linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote deficits, most likely maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection. Widths and positions of clines for these markers are concordant and coincident, suggesting that selection is unlikely to be concentrated on a few chromosomes. In contrast, a mitochondrial marker showed a significantly wider cline with centre offset toward the P24(XY) side. We argue that the discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear/chromosomal clines and overall asymmetry of the clines suggest a secondary origin of the contact zone and potential movement of the zone after contact. Genome-wide scans using many genetic markers and chromosomal mapping of these markers are needed to investigate whether chromosomal differences directly reduce gene flow after secondary contact.	2009	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00526.x		Insects	Orthoptera	Vandiemenella	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, cline analysis	Allozyme (5 loci), microsattelite (5 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE

Kronforst, Marcus R.	Gene flow persists millions of years after speciation in Heliconius butterflies	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Hybridization, or the interbreeding of two species, is now recognized as an important process in the evolution of many organisms. However, the extent to which hybridization results in the transfer of genetic material across the species boundary (introgression) remains unknown in many systems, as does the length of time after initial divergence that the species boundary remains porous to such gene flow. Results: Here I use genome-wide genotypic and DNA sequence data to show that there is introgression and admixture between the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades of the butterfly genus Heliconius, groups that separated from one another as many as 30 million generations ago. Estimates of historical migration based on 523 DNA sequences from 14 genes suggest unidirectional gene flow from the melpomene/cydno clade into the silvaniform clade. Furthermore, genetic clustering based on 520 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) identified multiple individuals of mixed ancestry showing that introgression is on-going. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that genomes can remain porous to gene flow very long after initial divergence. This, in turn, greatly expands the evolutionary potential afforded by introgression. Phenotypic and species diversity in a wide variety of organisms, including Heliconius, have likely arisen from introgressive hybridization. Evidence for continuous gene flow over millions of years points to introgression as a potentially important source of genetic variation to fuel the evolution of novel forms.	2008	10.1186/1471-2148-8-98		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	TRUE	just myDNA	TRUE	sequence similairty, demographic inference, trees, STRUCTURE	AFLP (13 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE	
Kulmuni, Jonna; Pamilo, Pekka	Introgression in hybrid ants is favored in females but selected against in males	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Hybridization is not a mere reproductive dead end but has been suggested to play a central role in speciation, for example, by introducing adaptive genetic variation. Our previous study uncovered a unique consequence of hybridization in Formica ants. In a population including two isolated but partially introgressed genetic groups, the females have an apparent hybrid background, whereas the males do not. This situation results in large-scale differences between male and female genomes that are stable throughout generations. Here, we compare genotypes from different developmental stages to investigate how sex-specific introgression and genetic differences between sexes are maintained. We show that strong selection rather than sex-dependent transmission maintains the genetic differences between sexes. All genotype combinations are produced and observed in the eggs of both sexes, but the alleles acquired through hybridization disappear from the haploid males during development from egg to adult as their frequencies drop toward zero. However, the same introgressed alleles increase in frequency and are favored when heterozygous in the females. Genotypes eliminated from males most likely represent incompatibilities arising from hybridization. Our results show an unusual situation of opposite selection, where introgression is favored in diploid females but selected against in haploid males. This finding suggests that introgressed genomic regions harbor both fitness-enhancing and -reducing elements. Our work highlights the complex consequences of hybridization and provides a rare opportunity to observe natural selection in real time in nature.	2014	10.1073/pnas.1323045111		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	expieremntal crosses	FALSE			TRUE	
Larson, Erica L.; White, Thomas A.; Ross, Charles L.; Harrison, Richard G.	Gene flow and the maintenance of species boundaries	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybrid zones are regions where individuals from genetically differentiated populations meet and mate, resulting in at least some offspring of mixed ancestry. Patterns of gene flow (introgression) in hybrid zones vary across the genome, allowing assessment of the role of individual genes or genome regions in reproductive isolation. Here, we document patterns of introgression between two recently diverged species of field crickets. We sampled at a very fine spatial scale and genotyped crickets for 110 highly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through transcriptome scans. Using both genomic and geographic cline analysis, we document remarkably abrupt transitions (<100m) in allele frequencies for 50 loci, despite high levels of gene flow at other loci. These are among the steepest clines documented for any hybridizing taxa. Furthermore, the cricket hybrid zone provides one of the clearest examples of the semi-permeability of species boundaries. Comparisons between data from the fine-scale transect and data (for the same set of markers) from sampling a much larger area in a different region of the cricket hybrid zone reveal consistent patterns of introgression for individual loci. The consistency in patterns of introgression between these two distant and distinct regions of the hybrid zone suggests that strong selection is acting to maintain abrupt discontinuities within the hybrid zone and that genomic regions with restricted introgression likely include genes that contribute to nonecological prezygotic barriers.	2014	10.1111/mec.12601		Insects	Orthoptera	Gryllus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, cline analysis, hybrid index	transcriptome (110 snps)	TRUE	
Llopart, Ana; Herrig, Danielle; Brud, Evgeny; Stecklein, Zachary	Sequential adaptive introgression of the mitochondrial genome in Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila santomea	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Interspecific hybridization provides the unique opportunity for species to tap into genetic variation present in a closely related species and potentially take advantage of beneficial alleles. It has become increasingly clear that when hybridization occurs, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) often crosses species boundaries, raising the possibility that it could serve as a recurrent target of natural selection and source of species' adaptations. Here we report the sequences of 46 complete mitochondrial genomes of Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila santomea, two sister species known to produce hybrids in nature (~3%). At least two independent events of mtDNA introgression are uncovered in this study, including an early invasion of the D.yakuba mitochondrial genome that fully replaced the D.santomea mtDNA native haplotypes and a more recent, ongoing event centred in the hybrid zone. Interestingly, this recent introgression event bears the signature of Darwinian natural selection, and the selective haplotype can be found at low frequency in Africa mainland populations of D.yakuba. We put forward the possibility that, because the effective population size of D.santomea is smaller than that of D.yakuba, the faster accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations associated with Muller's ratchet in the former species may have facilitated the replacement of the mutationally loaded mitochondrial genome of D.santomea by that of D.yakuba.	2014	10.1111/mec.12678		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	mtDNA	TRUE	demographic inference, trees, sequence similairty	mtDNA (13 loci)	TRUE

Adaptive Introgression across Species Boundaries in Heliconius Butterflies	PLOS GENETICS	It is widely documented that hybridisation occurs between many closely related species, but the importance of introgression in adaptive evolution remains unclear, especially in animals. Here, we have examined the role of introgressive hybridisation in transferring adaptations between mimetic Heliconius butterflies, taking advantage of the recent identification of a gene regulating red wing patterns in this genus. By sequencing regions both linked and unlinked to the red colour locus, we found a region that displays an almost perfect genotype by phenotype association across four species, H. melpomene, H. cydno, H. timareta, and H. heurippa. This particular segment is located 70 kb downstream of the red colour specification gene optix, and coalescent analysis indicates repeated introgression of adaptive alleles from H. melpomene into the H. cydno species clade. Our analytical methods complement recent genome scale data for the same region and suggest adaptive introgression has a crucial role in generating adaptive wing colour diversity in this group of butterflies.	2012	10.1371/journal.pgen.1002752		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees, demographic inference	mtDNA (1 locus), Sanger (8 loci)	TRUE	
Purcell, Jessica; Zahnd, Sacha; Athanasiades, Anouk; Tuerler, Rebecca; Chapuisat, Michel; Brelsford, Alan	Ants exhibit asymmetric hybridization in a mosaic hybrid zone	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Research on hybridization between species provides unparalleled insights into the pre- and postzygotic isolating mechanisms that drive speciation. In social organisms, colony-level incompatibilities may provide additional reproductive barriers not present in solitary species, and hybrid zones offer an opportunity to identify these barriers. Here, we use genotyping-by-sequencing to sequence hundreds of markers in a hybrid zone between two socially polymorphic ant species, Formica selysi and Formica cinerea. We characterize the zone, determine the frequency of hybrid workers, infer whether hybrid queens or males are produced and investigate whether hybridization is influenced by colony social organization. We also compare cuticular hydrocarbon profiles and aggression levels between the two species. The hybrid zone exhibits a mosaic structure. The asymmetric distribution of hybrids skewed towards F. cinerea suggests a pattern of unidirectional nuclear gene flow from F. selysi into F. cinerea. The occurrence of backcrossed individuals indicates that hybrid queens and/or males are fertile, and the presence of the F. cinerea mitochondrial haplotype in 97% of hybrids shows that successful F1 hybrids will generally have F. cinerea mothers and F. selysi fathers. We found no evidence that social organization contributes to speciation, because hybrids occur in both single-queen and multiple-queen colonies. Strongly differentiated cuticular hydrocarbon profiles and heightened interspecific aggression further reveal that species recognition cues are both present and perceived. The discovery of fertile hybrids and asymmetrical gene flow is unusual in ants, and this hybrid zone will therefore provide an ideal system with which to investigate speciation in social insects.	2016	10.1111/mec.13799		Insects	Hymenoptera	Formica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines, PCA	GBS (493 loci)	TRUE	
Rangel, Juliana; Giresi, Melissa; Pinto, Maria Alice; Baum, Kristen A.; Rubink, William L.; Coulson, Robert N.; Johnston, John Spencer	Africanization of a feral honey bee (Apis mellifera) population in South Texas: does a decade make a difference?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The arrival to the United States of the Africanized honey bee, a hybrid between European subspecies and the African subspecies Apis mellifera scutellata, is a remarkable model for the study of biological invasions. This immigration has created an opportunity to study the dynamics of secondary contact of honey bee subspecies from African and European lineages in a feral population in South Texas. An 11-year survey of this population (1991-2001) showed that mitochondrial haplotype frequencies changed drastically over time from a resident population of eastern and western European maternal ancestry, to a population dominated by the African haplotype. A subsequent study of the nuclear genome showed that the Africanization process included bidirectional gene flow between European and Africanized honey bees, giving rise to a new panmictic mixture of A.m.scutellata- and European-derived genes. In this study, we examined gene flow patterns in the same population 23years after the first hybridization event occurred. We found 28 active colonies inhabiting 92 tree cavities surveyed in a 5.14km(2) area, resulting in a colony density of 5.4 colonies/km(2). Of these 28 colonies, 25 were of A.m. scutellata maternal ancestry, and three were of western European maternal ancestry. No colonies of eastern European maternal ancestry were detected, although they were present in the earlier samples. Nuclear DNA revealed little change in the introgression of A.m.scutellata-derived genes into the population compared to previous surveys. Our results suggest this feral population remains an admixed swarm with continued low levels of European ancestry and a greater presence of African-derived mitochondrial genetic composition.	2016	10.1002/ece3.1974		Insects	Hymenoptera	Apis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE	PCR (3 genes), microsattelites (12 loci)	TRUE	
Raychoudhury, Rhitoban; Baldo, Laura; Oliveira, Deodoro C. S. G.; Werren, John H.	MODES OF ACQUISITION OF WOLBACHIA: HORIZONTAL TRANSFER, HYBRID INTROGRESSION, AND CODIVERGENCE IN THE NASONIA SPECIES COMPLEX	EVOLUTION	Wolbachia are maternally inherited bacteria that infect a large number of insects and are responsible for different reproductive alterations of their hosts. One of the key features of Wolbachia biology is its ability to move within and between host species, which contributes to the impressive diversity and range of infected hosts. Using multiple Wolbachia genes, including five developed for Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), the diversity and modes of movement of Wolbachia within the wasp genus Nasonia were investigated. Eleven different Wolbachia were found in the four species of Nasonia, including five newly identified infections. Five infections were acquired by horizontal transmission from other insect taxa, three have been acquired by hybridization between two Nasonia species, which resulted in a mitochondrial-Wolbachia sweep from one species to the other, and at least three have codiverged during speciation of their hosts. The results show that a variety of transfer mechanisms of Wolbachia are possible even within a single host genus. Codivergence of Wolbachia and their hosts is uncommon and provides a rare opportunity to investigate long-term Wolbachia evolution within a host lineage. Using synonymous divergence among codiverging infections and host nuclear genes, we estimate Wolbachia mutation rates to be approximately one-third that of the nuclear genome.	2009	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00533.x		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE	wolbachia transfer, not really introgression	Sanger (9 genes)	TRUE

Salazar, Camilo; Jiggins, Chris D.; Taylor, Jesse E.; Kronforst, Marcus R.; Linares, Mauricio	Gene flow and the genealogical history of Heliconius heurippa	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: The neotropical butterfly Heliconius heurippa has a hybrid colour pattern, which also contributes to reproductive isolation, making it a likely example of hybrid speciation. Here we used phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses of multilocus sequence data to investigate the origin of H. heurippa. Results: We sequenced a mitochondrial region (CoI and CoII), a sex-linked locus (Tpi) and two autosomal loci (w and sd) from H. heurippa and the putative parental species, H. cydno and H. melpomene. These were analysed in combination with data from two previously sequenced autosomal loci, DII and Inv. H. heurippa was monophyletic at mtDNA and Tpi, but showed a shared distribution of alleles derived from both parental lineages at all four autosomal loci. Estimates of genetic differentiation showed that H. heurippa is closer to H. cydno at mtDNA and three autosomal loci, intermediate at Tpi, and closer to H. melpomene at Dll. Using coalescent simulations with the Isolation-Migration model (IM), we attempted to establish the incidence of gene flow in the origin of H. heurippa. This analysis suggested that ongoing introgression is frequent between all three species and variable in extent between loci. Conclusion: Introgression, which is a necessary precursor of hybrid speciation, seems to have also blurred the coalescent history of these species. The origin of Heliconius heurippa may have been restricted to introgression of few colour pattern genes from H. melpomene into the H. cydno genome, with little evidence of genomic mosaicism.	2008	10.1186/1471-2148-8-132		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	trees, demographic models, sequence similarity	Sanger (6 genes)	TRUE	
Shoemaker, DD; Ahrens, ME; Ross, KG	Molecular phylogeny of fire ants of the Solenopsis saevissima species-group based on mtDNA sequences	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	The systematics of South American fire ants (Solenopsis saevissima species-group) has been plagued by difficulties in recognizing species and their relationships on the basis of morphological characters. We surveyed mtDNA sequences from 623 individuals representing 13 described and undescribed species within the species-group and 18 individuals representing other major Solenopsis lineages to generate a phylogeny of the mitochondrial genome. Our analyses support the monophyly of the S. saevissima species-group, consistent with a single Neotropical origin and radiation of this important group of ants, as well as the monophyly of the socially polymorphic species within the group, consistent with a single origin of polygyny (multiple queens per colony) as a derived form of social organization. The mtDNA sequences of the inquiline social parasite S. daguerrei form a clade that appears to be distantly related to sequences from the several host species, consistent with the view that advanced social parasitism did not evolve via sympatric speciation of intraspecific parasites. An important general finding is that species-level polyphyly of the mtDNA appears to be the rule in this group of ants. The existence of multiple divergent mtDNA lineages within several nominal species (including the pest S. invicta) suggests that the pattern of widespread polyphyly often stems from morphological delimitation that overcircumscribes species. However, in two cases the mtDNA polyphyly likely results from recent interspecific hybridization. While resolving species boundaries and relationships is important for understanding general patterns of diversification of South American fire ants, these issues are of added importance because invasive fire ants are emerging as global pests and becoming important model organisms for evolutionary research.

Sirvio, Anu; Pamilo, Pekka; Johnson, Robert A.; Page, Robert E., Jr.; Gadau, Juergen	ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF THE DEPENDENT LINEAGES IN THE GENETIC CASTE DETERMINATION SYSTEM OF POGONOMYRMEX ANTS	EVOLUTION	Hybridizing harvester ants of the Pogonomyrmex barbatus/rugosus complex have an exceptional genetic caste determination (GCD) mechanism. We combined computer simulations, population genomics, and linkage mapping using > 1000 nuclear AFLP markers and a partial mtDNA sequence to explore the genetic architecture and origin of the dependent lineages. Our samples included two pairs of hybridizing lineages, and the mitochondrial and nuclear data showed contradicting affinities between them. Clustering of individual genotypes based on nuclear markers indicated some exceptions to the general GCD system, that is, interlineage hybrid gynes as well as some pure-line workers. A genetic linkage map of P. rugosus showed one of the highest recombination rates ever measured in insects (14.0 cM/Mb), supporting the view that social insects are characterized by high recombination rates. The population data had 165 markers in which sibling pairs showed a significant genetic difference depending on the caste. The differences were scattered in the genome; 13 linkage groups had loci with F-ST > 0.9 between the hybridizing lineages J1 and J2.The mapping results and the population data indicate that the dependent lineages have been initially formed through hybridization at different points in time but the role of introgression has been insignificant in their later evolution.	2011	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01170.x		Insects	Hymenoptera	Pogonomyrmex	TRUE	TRUE	mtDNA only and no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees, PCA	AFLP (1147 markers), Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE

Vedenina, Varvara	Variation in complex courtship traits across a hybrid zone between grasshopper species of the Chorthippus albomarginatus group	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Closely related grasshopper species of the Chorthippus albomarginatus group are notable for their extremely complex courtship songs, accompanied by a visual display. Two species of this group, Ch. albomarginatus and Ch. oschei, were previously shown to hybridize in a wide mosaic hybrid zone in Ukraine and Moldova. In this paper, variation in five courtship song characters, one character of visual display and the number of stridulatory pegs were analysed across the hybrid zone to estimate selection against hybrids and strength of assortative mating. Comparison of cline width and position across the hybrid zone showed concordant and coincident clines in four traits, such as three song characters and one morphological character, and discordant and non-coincident clines in two other song characters and the character of visual display. Concordance of clines in different characters suggests an equal strength of selection acting on underlying loci. Increase of variance and covariance between phenotypic traits at the cline centre could more likely result from assortative mating than from selection against hybrids. Most pairwise cases showed the highest covariance for the oschei-like, than for the albomarginatus-like hybrid populations. This indicates that introgression of the oschei genes into the albomarginatus genome is stronger than vice versa, and may be evidence of the movement of the hybrid zone in favour of Ch. albomarginatus. Analysis of associations between phenotype and local vegetation showed that mosaic structure of the hybrid zone is explained to a great extent by habitat-phenotype associations.

We surveyed Wolbachia infections in 187 specimens of the fig wasp species, Ceratosolen solmsi, and found an infection prevalence of 89.3%. DNA sequencing of 20 individuals each from Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected subpopulations revealed extreme mtDNA divergence (up to 9.2% and 15.3% in CO1 and cytochrome b, respectively) between infected and uninfected wasps. Further, mtDNA diversity was significantly reduced within the infected group. Our sequencing of a large part of the mitochondrial genome from both Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected individuals revealed that high sequence divergence is common throughout the mitochondrial genome. These patterns suggest a partial selective sweep of mitochondria subsequent to the introduction of Wolbachia into C. solsmi, by hybrid introgression from a related species.	2012	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01561.x		Insects	Hymenoptera	Ceratosolen	TRUE	TRUE	mtDNA	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (7 genes)	TRUE	
Zhang, Wei; Kunte, Krushnamegh; Kronforst, Marcus R.	Genome-Wide Characterization of Adaptation and Speciation in Tiger Swallowtail Butterflies Using De Novo Transcriptome Assemblies	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybrid speciation appears to be rare in animals, yet characterization of possible examples offers to shed light on the genomic consequences of this unique phenomenon, as well as more general processes such as the role of adaptation in speciation. Here, we first generate transcriptome assemblies for a putative hybrid butterfly species, Papilio appalachiensis, its parental species, P. glaucus and P. canadensis, and an outgroup, P. polytes. Then, we use these data to infer genome-wide patterns of introgression and genomic mosaicism using both phylogenetic and population genetic approaches. Our results reveal that there is little genetic divergence among all three of the focal species, but the subset of gene trees that strongly support a specific tree topology suggest widespread sharing of genetic variation between P. appalachiensis and both parental species, likely as a result of hybrid speciation. We also find evidence for substantial shared genetic variation between P. glaucus and P. canadensis, which may be due to gene flow or ancestral variation. Consistent with previous work, we show that P. applachiensis is more similar to P. canadensis at Z-linked genes and more similar to P. glaucus at mitochondrial genes. We also identify a variety of targets of adaptive evolution, which appear to be enriched for traits that are likely to be important in the evolution of this butterfly system, such as pigmentation, hormone sensitivity, developmental processes, and cuticle formation. Overall, our results provide a genome-wide portrait of divergence and introgression associated with adaptation and speciation in an iconic butterfly radiation.	2013	10.1093/gbe/evt090		Insects	Lepidoptera	Papilio	TRUE	TRUE	does not report data just plots 	TRUE	Patterson's D, trees, sequence similarity	transcriptome (10000 genes)	TRUE

Breakdown in the Process of Incipient Speciation in Anopheles gambiae	GENETICS	Understanding genetic causes and effects of speciation in sympatric populations of sexually reproducing eukaryotes is challenging, controversial, and of practical importance for controlling rapidly evolving pests and pathogens. The major African malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) is considered to contain two incipient species with strong reproductive isolation, hybrids between the M and S molecular forms being very rare. Following recent observations of higher proportions of hybrid forms at a few sites in West Africa, we conducted new surveys of 12 sites in four contiguous countries (The Gambia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, and Republic of Guinea). Identification and genotyping of 3499 A. gambiae s.s. revealed high frequencies of M/S hybrid forms at each site, ranging from 5 to 42%, and a large spectrum of inbreeding coefficient values from 0.11 to 0.76, spanning most of the range expected between the alternative extremes of panmixia and assortative mating. Year-round sampling over 2 years at one of the sites in The Gambia showed that M/S hybrid forms had similar relative frequencies throughout periods of marked seasonal variation in mosquito breeding and abundance. Genome-wide scans with an Affymetrix high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) micro-array enabled replicate comparisons of pools of different molecular forms, in three separate populations. These showed strong differentiation between M and S forms only in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome that contains the molecular form-specific marker locus, with only a few other loci showing minor differences. In the X chromosome, the M/S hybrid forms were more differentiated from M than from S forms, supporting a hypothesis of asymmetric introgression and backcrossing.	2013	10.1534/genetics.112.148718		Insects	Diptera	Anopheles	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats 	TRUE	sequence similarity	microarray (400000 loci)	TRUE	
Masly, John P.; Presgraves, Daven C.	High-resolution genome-wide dissection of the two rules of speciation in Drosophila	PLOS BIOLOGY	Postzygotic reproductive isolation is characterized by two striking empirical patterns. The first is Haldane's rule-the preferential inviability or sterility of species hybrids of the heterogametic (XY) sex. The second is the so-called large X effect-substitution of one species's X chromosome for another's has a disproportionately large effect on hybrid fitness compared to similar substitution of an autosome. Although the first rule has been well-established, the second rule remains controversial. Here, we dissect the genetic causes of these two rules using a genome-wide introgression analysis of Drosophila mauritiana chromosome segments in an otherwise D. sechellia genetic background. We find that recessive hybrid incompatibilities outnumber dominant ones and that hybrid male steriles outnumber all other types of incompatibility, consistent with the dominance and faster-male theories of Haldane's rule, respectively. We also find that, although X-linked and autosomal introgressions are of similar size, most X-linked introgressions cause hybrid male sterility (60%) whereas few autosomal introgressions do (18%). Our results thus confirm the large X effect and identify its proximate cause: incompatibilities causing hybrid male sterility have a higher density on the X chromosome than on the autosomes. We evaluate several hypotheses for the evolutionary cause of this excess of X-linked hybrid male sterility.	2007	10.1371/journal.pbio.0050243		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE	artificial introgression		TRUE

Genomic signatures of introgression between commercial and native bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, in western Iberian Peninsula-Implications for conservation and trade regulation	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Human-mediated introductions of species may have profound impacts on native ecosystems. One potential impact with largely unforeseen consequences is the potential admixture of introduced with autochthonous species through hybridization. Throughout the world, bumblebees have been deliberately introduced for crop pollination with known negative impacts on native pollinators. Given the likely allochthonous origin of commercial bumblebees used in Portugal (subspecies Bombus terrestris terrestris and B. t. dalmatinus), our aim was to assess their putative introgression with the native Iberian subspecies B. terrestris lusitanicus. We analysed one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) and genomic data involving thousands of genome-wide restriction-site-associated DNA markers (RAD-seq). In the mitochondrial COX1 analyses, we detected one relatively common haplotype in commercial bumblebees, also present in wild samples collected nearby the greenhouses where the commercial hives are used. In the RAD-seq analysis, we found a clear genetic differentiation between native and commercial lineages. Furthermore, we detected candidate hybrids in the wild, as well as putatively escaped commercial bumblebees, some of which being potentially fertile males. Although we cannot assess directly the fitness effects of introgressed alleles, there is a risk of maladaptive allele introgression to the local bumblebee subspecies, which can negatively impact autochthon populations. One immediate recommendation to farmers is for the proper disposal of hive boxes, after their use in greenhouses, so as to minimize the risk of escapees contaminating native populations. On the other hand, the feasibility of using local subspecies B. t. lusitanicus, preferably with local production, should be evaluated.	2019	10.1111/eva.12732		Insects	Hymenoptera	Bombus	FALSE	FALSE		TRUE	STRUCTURE, D-stats, treemix	Sanger (1 gene), RAD (27 000 loci)	TRUE	
Beck, Emily A.; Thompson, Aaron C.; Sharbrough, Joel; Brud, Evgeny; Llopart, Ana	Gene flow between Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila santomea in subunit V of cytochrome c oxidase: A potential case of cytonuclear cointrogression	EVOLUTION	Introgression is the effective exchange of genetic information between species through natural hybridization. Previous genetic analyses of the Drosophila yakubaD. santomea hybrid zone showed that the mitochondrial genome of D. yakuba had introgressed into D. santomea and completely replaced its native form. Since mitochondrial proteins work intimately with nuclear-encoded proteins in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, we hypothesized that some nuclear genes in OXPHOS cointrogressed along with the mitochondrial genome. We analyzed nucleotide variation in the 12 nuclear genes that form cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in 33 Drosophila lines. COX is an OXPHOS enzyme composed of both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins and shows evidence of cytonuclear coadaptation in some species. Using maximum-likelihood methods, we detected significant gene flow from D. yakuba to D. santomea for the entire COX complex. Interestingly, the signal of introgression is concentrated in the three nuclear genes composing subunit V, which shows population migration rates significantly greater than the background level of introgression in these species. The detection of introgression in three proteins that work together, interact directly with the mitochondrial-encoded core, and are critical for early COX assembly suggests this could be a case of cytonuclear cointrogression.	2015	10.1111/evo.12718		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	gives D for individual loci but not sp.

Our tests to distinguish incomplete lineage sorting from introgression indicate that gene flow has obscured several ancient phylogenetic relationships in this group over large swathes of the genome. Introgressed loci are underrepresented in low-recombination and gene-rich regions, consistent with the purging of foreign alleles more tightly linked to incompatibility loci. Here, we identify a hitherto unknown inversion that traps a color pattern switch locus. We infer that this inversion was transferred between lineages by introgression and is convergent with a similar rearrangement in another part of the genus. These multiple de novo genome sequences enable improved understanding of the importance of introgression and selective processes in adaptive radiation.	2019	10.1126/science.aaw2090		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	trees, QUIBL, D-stats, 	WGS	TRUE	
Zhang, Wei; Dasmahapatra, Kanchon K.; Mallet, James; Moreira, Gilson R. P.; Kronforst, Marcus R.	Genome-wide introgression among distantly related Heliconius butterfly species	GENOME BIOLOGY	Background: Although hybridization is thought to be relatively rare in animals, the raw genetic material introduced via introgression may play an important role in fueling adaptation and adaptive radiation. The butterfly genus Heliconius is an excellent system to study hybridization and introgression but most studies have focused on closely related species such as H. cydno and H. melpomene. Here we characterize genome-wide patterns of introgression between H. besckei, the only species with a red and yellow banded 'postman' wing pattern in the tiger-striped silvaniform clade, and co-mimetic H. melpomene nanna. Results: We find a pronounced signature of putative introgression from H. melpomene into H. besckei in the genomic region upstream of the gene optix, known to control red wing patterning, suggesting adaptive introgression of wing pattern mimicry between these two distantly related species. At least 39 additional genomic regions show signals of introgression as strong or stronger than this mimicry locus. Gene flow has been on-going, with evidence of gene exchange at multiple time points, and bidirectional, moving from the melpomene to the silvaniform clade and vice versa. The history of gene exchange has also been complex, with contributions from multiple silvaniform species in addition to H. besckei. We also detect a signature of ancient introgression of the entire Z chromosome between the silvaniform and melpomene/cydno clades. Conclusions: Our study provides a genome-wide portrait of introgression between distantly related butterfly species. We further propose a comprehensive and efficient workflow for gene flow identification in genomic data sets.	2016	10.1186/s13059-016-0889-0		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	trees, Patterson's D, fD, 	WGS (23000000 loci)	TRUE

Maroja, Luana S.; Andres, Jose A.; Harrison, Richard G.	GENEALOGICAL DISCORDANCE AND PATTERNS OF INTROGRESSION AND SELECTION ACROSS A CRICKET HYBRID ZONE	EVOLUTION	In recently diverged species, ancestral polymorphism and introgression can cause incongruence between gene and species trees. In the face of hybridization, few genomic regions may exhibit reciprocal monophyly, and these regions, usually evolving rapidly under selection, may be important for the maintenance of species boundaries. In animals with internal fertilization, genes encoding seminal protein are candidate barrier genes. Recently diverged hybridizing species such as the field crickets Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, offer excellent opportunities to investigate the origins of barriers to gene exchange. These recently diverged species form a well-characterized hybrid zone, and share ancestral polymorphisms across the genome. We analyzed DNA sequence divergence for seminal protein loci, housekeeping loci, and mtDNA, using a combination of analytical approaches and extensive sampling across both species and the hybrid zone. We report discordant genealogical patterns and differential introgression rates across the genome. The most dramatic outliers, showing near-zero introgression and more structured species trees, are also the only two seminal protein loci under selection. These are candidate barrier genes with possible reproductive functions. We also use genealogical data to examine the demographic history of the field crickets and the current structure of the hybrid zone.	2009	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00767.x		Insects	Orthoptera	Gryllus	TRUE	TRUE	uses migration	TRUE	trees, demography	Sanger (10 genes)	TRUE	
Zhang, Wei; Leon-Ricardo, Brian X.; van Schooten, Bas; Van Belleghem, Steven M.; Counterman, Brian A.; McMillan, W. Owen; Kronforst, Marcus R.; Papa, Riccardo	Comparative Transcriptomics Provides Insights into Reticulate and Adaptive Evolution of a Butterfly Radiation	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Butterfly eyes are complex organs that are composed of a diversity of proteins and they play a central role in visual signaling and ultimately, speciation, and adaptation. Here, we utilized the whole eye transcriptome to obtain a more holistic view of the evolution of the butterfly eye while accounting for speciation events that co-occur with ancient hybridization. We sequenced and assembled transcriptomes from adult female eyes of eight species representing all major Glades of the Heliconius genus and an additional outgroup species, Dryas iulia. We identified 4,042 orthologous genes shared across all transcriptome data sets and constructed a transcriptome-wide phylogeny, which revealed topological discordance with the mitochondrial phylogenetic tree in the Heliconius pupal mating Glade. We then estimated introgression among lineages using additional genome data and found evidence for ancient hybridization leading to the common ancestor of Heliconius hortense and Heliconius clysonymus. We estimated the Ka/Ks ratio for each orthologous cluster and performed further tests to demonstrate genes showing evidence of adaptive protein evolution. Furthermore, we characterized patterns of expression for a subset of these positively selected orthologs using qRT-PCR. Taken together, we identified candidate eye genes that show signatures of adaptive molecular evolution and provide evidence of their expression divergence between species, tissues, and sexes. Our results demonstrate: 1) greater evolutionary changes in younger Heliconius lineages, that is, more positively selected genes in the cydno melpomene hecale group as opposed to the sara hortense erato group, and 2) suggest an ancient hybridization leading to speciation among Heliconius pupal-mating species.	2019	10.1093/gbe/evz202		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fD	TRUE	D-stats, trees	WGS (36000000 loci), transcriptome	TRUE

Hybridization and gene flow in the mega-pest lineage of moth, Helicoverpa	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Within the mega-pest lineage of heliothine moths are a number of polyphagous, highly mobile species for which the exchange of adaptive traits through hybridization would affect their properties as pests. The recent invasion of South America by one of the most significant agricultural pests, Helicoverpa armigera, raises concerns for the formation of novel combinations of adaptive genes following hybridization with the closely related Helicoverpa zea. To investigate the propensity for hybridization within the genus Helicoverpa, we carried out whole-genome resequencing of samples from six species, focusing in particular upon H. armigera population structure and its relationship with H. zea. We show that both H. armigera subspecies have greater genetic diversity and effective population sizes than do the other species. We find no signals for gene flow among the six species, other than between H. armigera and H. zea, with nine Brazilian individuals proving to be hybrids of those two species. Eight had largely H. armigera genomes with some introgressed DNA from H. zea scattered throughout. The ninth resembled an F1 hybrid but with stretches of homozygosity for each parental species that reflect previous hybridization. Regions homozygous for H. armigera-derived DNA in this individual included one containing a gustatory receptor and esterase genes previously associated with host range, while another encoded a cytochrome P450 that confers insecticide resistance. Our data point toward the emergence of novel hybrid ecotypes and highlight the importance of monitoring H. armigera genotypes as they spread through the Americas.	2018	10.1073/pnas.1718831115		Insects	Lepidoptera	Helicoverpa	TRUE	TRUE	measures f3 	TRUE	trees, f3, fD, demography	WGS (22000000 loci)	TRUE	
Cong, Qian; Zhang, Jing; Shen, Jinhui; Cao, Xiaolong; Brevignon, Christian; Grishin, Nick, V	Speciation in North American Junonia from a genomic perspective	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY	Delineating species boundaries in phylogenetic groups undergoing recent radiation is a daunting challenge akin to discretizing continuity. Here, we propose a general approach exemplified by American butterflies from the genus Junonia Hubner notorious for the variety of similar phenotypes, ease of hybridization, and the lack of consensus about their classification. We obtain whole-genome shotgun sequences of about 200 specimens. We reason that discreteness emerges from continuity by means of a small number of key players, and search for the proteins that diverged markedly between sympatric populations of different species, while keeping low polymorphism within these species. Being 0.25% of the total number, these three dozen 'speciation' proteins indeed partition pairs of Junonia populations into two clusters with a prominent break in between, while all proteins taken together fail to reveal this discontinuity. Populations with larger divergence from each other, comparable to that between two sympatric species, form the first cluster and correspond to different species. The other cluster is characterized by smaller divergence, similar to that between allopatric populations of the same species and comprise conspecific pairs. Using this method, we conclude that J. genoveva (Cramer), J. litoralis Brevignon, J. evarete (Cramer), and J. divaricata C. & R. Felder are restricted to South America. We find that six species of Junonia are present in the United States, one of which is new: Junonia stemosa Grishin, sp.n. (i), found in south Texas and phenotypically closest to J. nigrosuffusa W. Barnes & McDunnough (ii) in its dark appearance. In the pale nudum of the antennal club, these two species resemble J. zonalis C. & R. Felder (iii) from Florida and the Caribbean Islands. The pair of sister species, J. grisea Austin & J. Emmel (iv) and J. coenia Hubner (v), represent the classic west/east U.S.A. split. The mangrove feeder (as caterpillar), dark nudum J. neildi Brevignon (vi) enters south Texas as a new subspecies Junonia neildi varia Grishin ssp.n. characterized by more extensive hybridization with and introgression from J. coenia, and, as a consequence, more variable wing patterns compared with the nominal J. n. neildi in Florida. Furthermore, a new mangrove-feeding species from the Pacific Coast of Mexico is described as Junonia pacoma Grishin sp.n. Finally, genomic analysis suggests that J. nigrosuffusa may be a hybrid species formed by the ancestors of J. grisea and J. stemosa sp.n.

Ryan, Sean F.; Deines, Jillian M.; Scriber, J. Mark; Pfrender, Michael E.; Jones, Stuart E.; Emrich, Scott J.; Hellmann, Jessica J.	Climate-mediated hybrid zone movement revealed with genomics, museum collection, and simulation modeling	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Climate-mediated changes in hybridization will dramatically alter the genetic diversity, adaptive capacity, and evolutionary trajectory of interbreeding species. Our ability to predict the consequences of such changes will be key to future conservation and management decisions. Here we tested through simulations how recent warming (over the course of a 32-y period) is affecting the geographic extent of a climate-mediated developmental threshold implicated in maintaining a butterfly hybrid zone (Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis; Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). These simulations predict a 68-km shift of this hybrid zone. To empirically test this prediction, we assessed genetic and phenotypic changes using contemporary and museum collections and document a 40-km northward shift of this hybrid zone. Interactions between the two species appear relatively unchanged during hybrid zone movement. We found no change in the frequency of hybridization, and regions of the genome that experience little to no introgression moved largely in concert with the shifting hybrid zone. Model predictions based on climate scenarios predict this hybrid zone will continue to move northward, but with substantial spatial heterogeneity in the velocity (55-144 km/1 degrees C), shape, and contiguity of movement. Our findings suggest that the presence of nonclimatic barriers (e.g., genetic incompatibilities) and/or nonlinear responses to climatic gradients may preserve species boundaries as the species shift. Further, we show that variation in the geography of hybrid zone movement could result in evolutionary responses that differ for geographically distinct populations spanning hybrid zones, and thus have implications for the conservation and management of genetic diversity.	2018	10.1073/pnas.1714950115		Insects	Lepidoptera	Papilio	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	clines, STRUCTURE	RAD (56 loci)	TRUE	
Weigand, Hannah; Weiss, Martina; Cai, Huimin; Li, Yongping; Yu, Lili; Zhang, Christine; Leese, Florian	Deciphering the origin of mito-nuclear discordance in two sibling caddisfly species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	An increasing number of phylogenetic studies have reported discordances among nuclear and mitochondrial markers. These discrepancies are highly relevant to widely used biodiversity assessment approaches, such as DNA barcoding, that rely almost exclusively on mitochondrial markers. Although the theoretical causes of mito-nuclear discordances are well understood, it is often extremely challenging to determine the principal underlying factor in a given study system. In this study, we uncovered significant mito-nuclear discordances in a pair of sibling caddisfly species. Application of genome sequencing, ddRAD and DNA barcoding revealed ongoing hybridization, as well as historical hybridization in Pleistocene refugia, leading us to identify introgression as the ultimate cause of the observed discordance pattern. Our novel genomic data, the discovery of a European-wide hybrid zone and the availability of established techniques for laboratory breeding make this species pair an ideal model system for studying species boundaries with ongoing gene flow.	2017	10.1111/mec.14292		Insects	Trichoptera	Sericostoma	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	RAD (1396 loci)	TRUE

Although the evolutionary process in triatomine is considered as disruptive, cryptic speciation and homoploid hybridization also are possible modes of speciation. Several analyses suggested Triatoma brasiliensis macromelasoma as a product of hybridization between T. brasiliensis and Triatoma juazeirensis. Thus, we analyzed genetic characteristics (chromosomal analysis, genetic distance for the mitochondrial ND1 gene, and the pattern of bands of internal transcribed spacer [ITS]-1) of these species, with emphasis on the phenomenon of homoploid hybridization. All species showed the same cytogenetic characteristics, low genetic distance for ND1 gene, and the same pattern of ITS-1 bands. We consider that these genetic characteristics, together with the large chromatic polymorphism and the viability of experimental crosses possibly are due to the processes of introgression that these species suffered during the process of homoploid hybridization.	2019	10.4269/ajtmh.17-0813		Insects	Hemiptera	Triatoma	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	PCR (1 locus)	TRUE	
Cooper, Brandon S.; Vanderpool, Dan; Conner, William R.; Matute, Daniel R.; Turelli, Michael	Wolbachia Acquisition by Drosophila yakuba-Clade Hosts and Transfer of Incompatibility Loci Between Distantly Related Wolbachia	GENETICS	Maternally transmitted Wolbachia infect about half of insect species, yet the predominant mode(s) of Wolbachia acquisition remains uncertain. Species-specific associations could be old, with Wolbachia and hosts codiversifying (i.e., cladogenic acquisition), or relatively young and acquired by horizontal transfer or introgression. The three Drosophila yakuba-clade hosts [(D. santomea, D. yakuba) D. teissieri] diverged similar to 3 MYA and currently hybridize on the West African islands Bioko and Sao Tome. Each species is polymorphic for nearly identical Wolbachia that cause weak cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI)-reduced egg hatch when uninfected females mate with infected males. D. yakuba-clade Wolbachia are closely related to wMel, globally polymorphic in D. melanogaster. We use draft Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes to demonstrate that D. yakuba-clade phylogenies for Wolbachia and mitochondria tend to follow host nuclear phylogenies. However, roughly half of D. santomea individuals, sampled both inside and outside of the Sao Tome hybrid zone, have introgressed D. yakuba mitochondria. Both mitochondria and Wolbachia possess far more recent common ancestors than the bulk of the host nuclear genomes, precluding cladogenic Wolbachia acquisition. General concordance of Wolbachia and mitochondrial phylogenies suggests that horizontal transmission is rare, but varying relative rates of molecular divergence complicate chronogram-based statistical tests. Loci that cause CI in wMel are disrupted in D. yakuba-clade Wolbachia; but a second set of loci predicted to cause CI are located in the same WO prophage region. These alternative CI loci seem to have been acquired horizontally from distantly related Wolbachia, with transfer mediated by flanking Wolbachia-specific ISWpi1 transposons.	2019	10.1534/genetics.119.302349		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	wolbachia, Sanger (33 genes)	TRUE

Widespread hybridization within mound-building wood ants in Southern Finland results in cytonuclear mismatches and potential for sex-specific hybrid breakdown	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybridization and gene flow between diverging lineages are increasingly recognized as common evolutionary processes, and their consequences can vary from hybrid breakdown to adaptive introgression. We have previously found a population of wood ant hybrids between Formica aquilonia and F. polyctena that shows antagonistic effects of hybridization: females with introgressed alleles show hybrid vigour, whereas males with the same alleles show hybrid breakdown. Here, we investigate whether hybridization is a general phenomenon in this species pair and analyse 647 worker samples from 16 localities in Finland using microsatellite markers and a 1200-bp mitochondrial sequence. Our results show that 27 sampled nests contained parental-like gene pools (six putative F. polyctena and 21 putative F. aquilonia) and all remaining nests (69), from nine localities, contained hybrids of varying degrees. Patterns of genetic variation suggest these hybrids arise from everal hybridization events or, instead, have backcrossed to the parental gene pools to varying extents. In contrast to expectations, the mitochondrial haplotypes of the parental species were not randomly distributed among the hybrids. Instead, nests that were closer to parental-like F. aquilonia for nuclear markers preferentially had F. polyctena's mitochondria and vice versa. This systematic pattern suggests there may be underlying selection favouring cytonuclear mismatch and hybridization. We also found a new hybrid locality with strong genetic differences between the sexes similar to those predicted under antagonistic selection on male and female hybrids. Further studies are needed to determine the selective forces that act on male and female genomes in these newly discovered hybrids.	2017	10.1111/mec.14183		Insects	Hymenoptera	Formica	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE, PCA	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelite (9 markers)	TRUE	
Olalla Lorenzo-Carballa, M.; Watts, Phillip C.; Cordero-Rivera, Adolfo	Hybridization between Calopteryx splendens and C. haemorrhoidalis confirmed by morphological and genetic analyses	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ODONATOLOGY	Hybridization between Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis and any of its congeners has not been reported until now. We observed spontaneous matings between male C. splendens and female C. haemorrhoidalis at a locality in Central Italy, together with some putative hybrid individuals that had a mixed phenotype. Here, we report the morphological and molecular characterization of five suspected hybrids collected from this population during 2001 (n=1), 2012 (n=2) and 2013 (n=2). A discriminant analysis based on 13 morphological variables correctly separated both parental species (with 100% assignation success) and classified the hybrid from 2001 as splendens phenotype and those from 2012 and 2013 as haemorrhoidalis. Genotype data (microsatellite loci) was used to confirm the hybrid origin of these specimens, although there were differences between the individual from 2001 and those from 2012 and 2013; the 2001 individual had alleles that were present in both parent species, suggesting it is an F1 hybrid, but the individuals collected in 2012 and 2013 had private alleles at eight (out of 12) loci and only a small portion of the genome in common with C. splendens, which suggests that introgression is occurring in this population. Similarities in mitochondrial DNA sequences indicate that the 2001 hybrid and the 2012-2013 hybrids have splendens and haemorrhoidalis maternal origins respectively, which, in contrast with behavioural observations, indicates that interspecific matings in both directions are possible. This is the first demonstration that C. haemorrhoidalis can hybridize with other congeners to produce viable offspring.	2014	10.1080/13887890.2014.951696		Insects	Odonata	Calopteryx	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	Sanger (2 genes), microsattelite (19 markers)	TRUE	
Schrider, Daniel R.; Ayroles, Julien; Matute, Daniel R.; Kern, Andrew D.	Supervised machine learning reveals introgressed loci in the genomes of Drosophila simulans and D-sechellia	PLOS GENETICS	Hybridization and gene flow between species appears to be common. Even though it is clear that hybridization is widespread across all surveyed taxonomic groups, the magnitude and consequences of introgression are still largely unknown. Thus it is crucial to develop the statistical machinery required to uncover which genomic regions have recently acquired haplotypes via introgression from a sister population. We developed a novel machine learning framework, called FILET (Finding Introgressed Loci via Extra-Trees) capable of revealing genomic introgression with far greater power than competing methods. FILET works by combining information from a number of population genetic summary statistics, including several new statistics that we introduce, that capture patterns of variation across two populations. We show that FILET is able to identify loci that have experienced gene flow between related species with high accuracy, and in most situations can correctly infer which population was the donor and which was the recipient. Here we describe a data set of outbred diploid Drosophila sechellia genomes, and combine them with data from D. simulans to examine recent introgression between these species using FILET. Although we find that these populations may have split more recently than previously appreciated, FILET confirms that there has indeed been appreciable recent introgression (some of which might have been adaptive) between these species, and reveals that this gene flow is primarily in the direction of D. simulans to D. sechellia.	2018	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007341		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	measures dmin	TRUE	dmin, sequence similarity, ML	WGS (100000000 loci)	TRUE	
Araripe, Luciana O.; Montenegro, Horacio; Lemos, Bernardo; Hartl, Daniel L.	Fine-scale genetic mapping of a hybrid sterility factor between Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana: the varied and elusive functions of "speciation genes"	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Hybrid male sterility (HMS) is a usual outcome of hybridization between closely related animal species. It arises because interactions between alleles that are functional within one species may be disrupted in hybrids. The identification of genes leading to hybrid sterility is of great interest for understanding the evolutionary process of speciation. In the current work we used marked P-element insertions as dominant markers to efficiently locate one genetic factor causing a severe reduction in fertility in hybrid males of Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana. Results: Our mapping effort identified a region of 9 kb on chromosome 3, containing three complete and one partial coding sequences. Within this region, two annotated genes are suggested as candidates for the HMS factor, based on the comparative molecular characterization and public-source information. Gene Taf1 is partially contained in the region, but yet shows high polymorphism with four fixed non-synonymous substitutions between the two species. Its molecular functions involve sequence-specific DNA binding and transcription factor activity. Gene agt is a small, intronless gene, whose molecular function is annotated as methylated-DNA-protein-cysteine S-methyltransferase activity. High polymorphism and one fixed non-synonymous substitution suggest this is a fast evolving gene. The gene trees of both genes perfectly separate D. simulans and D. mauritiana into monophyletic groups. Analysis of gene expression using microarray revealed trends that were similar to those previously found in comparisons between whole-genome hybrids and parental species. Conclusions: The identification following confirmation of the HMS candidate gene will add another case study leading to understanding the evolutionary process of hybrid incompatibility.	2010	10.1186/1471-2148-10-385		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE	
Llopart, A; Lachaise, D; Coyne, JA	Multilocus analysis of introgression between two sympatric sister species of Drosophila: Drosophila yakuba and D. santomea	GENETICS	Drosophila yakuba is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, while D. santomea is endemic to the volcanic island of SaoTome in the Atlantic Ocean, 280 km west of Gabon. On Sao Tome, D. yakuba is found mainly in open lowland forests, and D. santomea is restricted to the wet misty forests at higher elevations. At intermediate elevations, the species form a hybrid zone where hybrids occur at a frequency of similar to 1%. To determine the extent of gene flow between these species we studied polymorphism and divergence patterns in 29 regions distributed throughout the genome, including mtDNA and three genes on the Y chromosome. This multilocus approach, together with the comparison to the two allopatric species D. mauritiana and D. sechellia, allowed us to distinguish between forces that should affect allgenes and forces that should act on some genes (e.g., introgression). Our results show that D. yakuba mtDNA has replaced that of D. santomea and that there is also significant introgression for two nuclear genes, yellow and salr. The majority of genes, however, has remained distinct. These two species therefore do not form a "hybrid swarm" in which much of the genome shows substantial introgression while disruptive selection maintains distinctness for only a few traits (e.g., pigmentation and male genitalia).	2005	10.1534/genetics.104.033597		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (45 genes)	TRUE	
Cooper, Brandon S.; Sedghifar, Alisa; Nash, W. Thurston; Comeault, Aaron A.; Matute, Daniel R.	A Maladaptive Combination of Traits Contributes to the Maintenance of a Drosophila Hybrid Zone	CURRENT BIOLOGY	Drosophila teissieri and D. yakuba diverged approximately 3 mya and are thought to share a large, ancestral, African range [1-3]. These species now co-occur in parts of continental Africa and in west Africa on the island of Bioko [1, 4]. While D. yakuba is a human commensal, D. teissieri seems to be associated with Parinari fruits, restricting its range to forests [4-6]. Genome data indicate introgression, despite no evidence of contemporary hybridization. Here we report the discovery of D. eyakuba-D. teissieri hybrids at the interface of secondary forests and disturbed, open habitats on Bioko. We demonstrate that hybrids are the F-1 progeny of D. yakuba females and D. teissieri males. At high temperatures like those found on Bioko, D. teissieri females are generally less receptive to mating, and in combination with temperature effects on egg lay and egg-to-adult viability, this decreases the potential for gene flow between female D. teissieri and male D. yakuba relative to the reciprocal cross. Field and laboratory experiments demonstrate that F-1 hybrids have a maladaptive combination of D. yakuba behavior and D. teissieri physiology, generating additional barriers to gene flow. Nevertheless, analysis of introgressed and non-introgressed regions of the genome indicate that, while rare, gene flow is relatively recent. Our observations identify precise intrinsic and extrinsic factors that, along with hybrid male sterility, limit gene flow and maintain these species. These data contribute to a growing body of literature that suggests the Gulf of Guinea may be a hotspot for hybridization.	2018	10.1016/j.cub.2018.07.005		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	calculated age of introgression from D stat in previos paper 	TRUE	clines	WGS	TRUE	
Andres, Jose A.; Larson, Erica L.; Bogdanowicz, Steven M.; Harrison, Richard G.	Patterns of Transcriptome Divergence in the Male Accessory Gland of Two Closely Related Species of Field Crickets	GENETICS	One of the central questions in evolutionary genetics is how much of the genome is involved in the early stages of divergence between populations, causing them to be reproductively isolated. In this article, we investigate genomic differentiation in a pair of closely related field crickets (Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus). These two species are the result of allopatric divergence and now interact along an extensive hybrid zone in eastern North America. Genes encoding seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are often divergent between species, and it has been hypothesized that these proteins may play a key role in the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation between diverging lineages. Hence, we chose to scan the accessory gland transcriptome to enable direct comparisons of differentiation for genes known to encode SFPs with differentiation in a much larger set of genes expressed in the same tissue. We have characterized differences in allele frequency between two populations for >6000 SNPs and >26,000 contigs. About 10% of all SNPs showed nearly fixed differences between the two species. Genes encoding SFPs did not have significantly elevated numbers of fixed SNPs per contig, nor did they seem to show larger differences than expected in their average allele frequencies. The distribution of allele frequency differences across the transcriptome is distinctly bimodal, but the relatively high proportion of fixed SNPs does not necessarily imply "ancient" divergence between these two lineages. Further studies of linkage disequilibrium and introgression across the hybrid zone are needed to direct our attention to those genome regions that are important for reproductive isolation.	2013	10.1534/genetics.112.142299		Insects	Orthoptera	Gryllus	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	transcriptome (9731 loci)	TRUE

Spatiotemporal dynamics of gene flow and hybrid fitness between the M and S forms of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	The M and S forms of Anopheles gambiae have been the focus of intense study by malaria researchers and evolutionary biologists interested in ecological speciation. Divergence occurs at three discrete islands in genomes that are otherwise nearly identical. An "islands of speciation"model proposes that diverged regions contain genes that are maintained by selection in the face of gene flow. An alternative "incidental island"model maintains that gene flow between M and S is effectively zero and that divergence islands are unrelated to speciation. A "divergence island SNP"assay was used to explore the spatial and temporal distributions of hybrid genotypes. Results revealed that hybrid individuals occur at frequencies ranging between 5% and 97% in every population examined. A temporal analysis revealed that assortative mating is unstable and periodically breaks down, resulting in extensive hybridization. Results suggest that hybrids suffer a fitness disadvantage, but at least some hybrid genotypes are viable. Stable introgression of the 2L speciation island occurred at one site following a hybridization event.	2013	10.1073/pnas.1316851110		Insects	Diptera	Anopheles	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	DIS (15 loci)	TRUE

Alice	Developing reduced SNP assays from whole-genome sequence data to estimate introgression in an organism with complex genetic patterns, the Iberian honeybee (Apis mellifera iberiensis)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	The most important managed pollinator, the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), has been subject to a growing number of threats. In western Europe, one such threat is large-scale introductions of commercial strains (C-lineage ancestry), which is leading to introgressive hybridization and even the local extinction of native honeybee populations (M-lineage ancestry). Here, we developed reduced assays of highly informative SNPs from 176 whole genomes to estimate C-lineage introgression in the most diverse and evolutionarily complex subspecies in Europe, the Iberian honeybee (Apis mellifera iberiensis). We started by evaluating the effects of sample size and sampling a geographically restricted area on the number of highly informative SNPs. We demonstrated that a bias in the number of fixed SNPs (F-ST=1) is introduced when the sample size is small (N10) and when sampling only captures a small fraction of a population's genetic diversity. These results underscore the importance of having a representative sample when developing reliable reduced SNP assays for organisms with complex genetic patterns. We used a training data set to design four independent SNP assays selected from pairwise F-ST between the Iberian and C-lineage honeybees. The designed assays, which were validated in holdout and simulated hybrid data sets, proved to be highly accurate and can be readily used for monitoring populations not only in the native range of A.m.iberiensis in Iberia but also in the introduced range in the Balearic islands, Macaronesia and South America, in a time- and cost-effective manner. While our approach used the Iberian honeybee as model system, it has a high value in a wide range of scenarios for the monitoring and conservation of potentially hybridized domestic and wildlife populations.	2018	10.1111/eva.12623		Insects	Hymenoptera	Apis	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	microarray (2000000 loci)	TRUE	
Davey, John W.; Barker, Sarah L.; Rastas, Pasi M.; Pinharanda, Ana; Martin, Simon H.; Durbin, Richard; McMillan, W. Owen; Merrill, Richard M.; Jiggins, Chris D.	No evidence for maintenance of a sympatric Heliconius species barrier by chromosomal inversions	EVOLUTION LETTERS	Mechanisms that suppress recombination are known to help maintain species barriers by preventing the breakup of coadapted gene combinations. The sympatric butterfly species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno are separated by many strong barriers, but the species still hybridize infrequently in the wild, and around 40% of the genome is influenced by introgression. We tested the hypothesis that genetic barriers between the species are maintained by inversions or other mechanisms that reduce between-species recombination rate. We constructed fine-scale recombination maps for Panamanian populations of both species and their hybrids to directly measure recombination rate within and between species, and generated long sequence reads to detect inversions. We find no evidence for a systematic reduction in recombination rates in F1 hybrids, and also no evidence for inversions longer than 50 kb that might be involved in generating or maintaining species barriers. This suggests that mechanisms leading to global or local reduction in recombination do not play a significant role in the maintenance of species barriers between H. melpomene and H. cydno.	2017	10.1002/evl3.12		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	TRUE	no stats given	TRUE	fD, sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE	
Turissini, David A.; Matute, Daniel R.	Fine scale mapping of genomic introgressions within the Drosophila yakuba clade	PLOS GENETICS	The process of speciation involves populations diverging over time until they are genetically and reproductively isolated. Hybridization between nascent species was long thought to directly oppose speciation. However, the amount of interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) mediated by hybridization remains largely unknown, although recent progress in genome sequencing has made measuring introgression more tractable. A natural place to look for individuals with admixed ancestry (indicative of introgression) is in regions where species co-occur. In west Africa, D. santomea and D. yakuba hybridize on the island of Sao Tome A, while D. yakuba and D. teissieri hybridize on the nearby island of Bioko. In this report, we quantify the genomic extent of introgression between the three species of the Drosophila yakuba clade (D. yakuba, D. santomea), D. teissieri). We sequenced the genomes of 86 individuals from all three species. We also developed and applied a new statistical framework, using a hidden Markov approach, to identify introgression. We found that introgression has occurred between both species pairs but most introgressed segments are small (on the order of a few kilobases). After ruling out the retention of ancestral polymorphism as an explanation for these similar regions, we find that the sizes of introgressed haplotypes indicate that genetic exchange is not recent (>1,000 generations ago). We additionally show that in both cases, introgression was rarer on X chromosomes than on autosomes which is consistent with sex chromosomes playing a large role in reproductive isolation. Even though the two species pairs have stable contemporary hybrid zones, providing the opportunity for ongoing gene flow, our results indicate that genetic exchange between these species is currently rare.	2017	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006971		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	Patterson's D, treemix, IntHMM, PCA	WGS	TRUE	
Parejo, Melanie; Henriques, Dora; Pinto, M. Alice; Soland-Reckeweg, Gabriele; Neuditschko, Markus	Empirical comparison of microsatellite and SNP markers to estimate introgression in Apis mellifera mellifera	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH	The genetic identity of the dark European honey bee, Apis mellifera mellifera is currently under pressure throughout most of its native range due to large scale commercial trade and replacement with honey bees of mainly Eastern European ancestry (C-lineage: Apis mellifera carnica and Apis mellifera ligustica). To counteract this process, numerous conservation efforts for the protection of native honey bees are sprouting across Europe. For the management of such protected areas and conservation breeding purposes, honey bee subspecies have been routinely identified through wing morphology and through DNA-hybrid tests using microsatellite markers. Currently, new methods are evolving including rapid innovations in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology and high-throughput sequencing. Here, we aim to quantify potential marker-specific biases of hybrid tests and give recommendations for applications in honey bee conservation management. Using an empirical dataset, we first assessed the accuracy of a recently developed reduced SNP panel to estimate C-lineage introgression in A. m. mellifera compared to whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. Using another independent data set, we estimated the differences in admixture proportions between the currently applied hybrid test based on microsatellites and the novel SNP test. We demonstrate that the SNP-based test which contains highly ancestry-informative markers is very efficient to estimate genome-wide ancestry. Furthermore, we report discrepancies between microsatellite and SNP-based admixture proportions. For conservation management, we, therefore, recommend the implementation of SNP-based hybrid tests to maintain high genetic variation within the breeding population, while minimizing influence of introduced honey bees.	2018	10.1080/00218839.2018.1494894		Insects	Hymenoptera	Apis	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	SNPs (17 loci), microsattelites (12 markers)	TRUE	
Sawamura, Kyoichi; Sato, Hajime; Lee, Chow-Yang; Kamimura, Yoshitaka; Matsuda, Muneo	A Natural Population Derived from Species Hybridization in the Drosophila ananassae Species Complex on Penang Island, Malaysia	ZOOLOGICAL SCIENCE	We surveyed natural population of the Drosophila ananassae species complex on Penang Island, Malaysia. Analyses of phenotypic traits, chromosome arrangements, molecular markers, and reproductive isolation suggest the existence of two species: D. ananassae and D. cf. parapallidosa. Molecular marker analysis indicates that D. cf. parapallidosa carries chromosome Y and 4 introgressions from D. ananassae. Thus, D. cf. parapallidosa seems to be a hybrid descendant that recently originated from a natural D. parapallidosa female x D. ananassae male cross. Furthermore, D. cf. parapallidosa behaves differently from authentic D. parapallidosa with respect to its reproductive isolation from D. ananassae. Premating isolation is usually seen in only the D. ananassae female x D. parapallidosa male cross, but we observed it in crosses of both directions between D. ananassae and D. cf. parapallidosa. In addition, hybrid males from the D. ananassae female x D. parapallidosa. cross are usually sterile, but they were fertile when D. ananassae female were mated with D. cf. parapallidosa male. We attempted an artificial reconstruction of the hybrid species to simulate the evolutionary process(es) that produced D. cf. parapallidosa. This is a rare case of natural hybrid population in Drosophila and may be a useful system for elucidating speciation with gene flow.	2016	10.2108/zs160038		Insects	Lepidoptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	morphology, sequence similarity	PCR, RFLP	TRUE	
Bachtrog, D; Thornton, K; Clark, A; Andolfatto, P	Extensive introgression of mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear genes in the Drosophila yakuba species group	EVOLUTION	Studies of gene flow between recently diverged species can illuminate the role of natural selection in the formation of new species. Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba are recently diverged, partially reproductively isolated species that continue to hybridize in the wild, and appear to be reproductively isolated from the more distantly related species D. teissieri. We examine patterns of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence in these three species at multiple X-linked, Y-linked, and mitochondrial markers. All three species harbor drastically reduced variability on the Y chromosome relative to the X, as expected for a nonrecombining chromosome subject to variation-reducing selection. The three species are generally well differentiated at the nuclear markers, with little evidence for recent introgression for either the X- or Y-linked genes. Based on the nuclear genes, we estimate that D. santomea and D. yakuba diverged about one-half million years ago and split from D. teissieri about one million years ago. In contrast to the pattern at nuclear loci, all three species share a very similar mtDNA haplotype. We show that the mtDNA must have recently introgressed across species boundaries in the D. yakuba subgroup and that its fixation was driven by either selection on the mitochondria itself or other cytoplasmic factors. These results demonstrate that different regions of the genome can have distinct evolutionary dynamics in the context of species formation. Although natural selection is usually thought of as accentuating divergence between species, our results imply that it can also act as a homogenizing force.	2006	10.1111/j.0014-3820.2006.tb01107.x		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (5 genes)	TRUE	
Darras, Hugo; Aron, Serge	Introgression of mitochondrial DNA among lineages in a hybridogenetic ant	BIOLOGY LETTERS	We report a remarkable pattern of incongruence between nuclear and mitochondrial variations in a social insect, the desert ant Cataglyphis hispanica. This species reproduces by social hybridogenesis. In all populations, two distinct genetic lineages coexist; non-reproductive workers develop from hybrid crosses between the lineages, whereas reproductive offspring (males and new queens) are typically produced asexually by parthenogenesis. Genetic analyses based on nuclear markers revealed that the two lineages remain highly differentiated despite constant hybridization for worker production. Here, we show that, in contrast with nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does not recover the two lineages as monophyletic. Rather, mitochondrial haplotypes cluster according to their geographical origin. We argue that this cytonuclear incongruence stems from introgression of mtDNA among lineages, and review the mechanisms likely to explain this pattern under social hybridogenesis.	2015	10.1098/rsbl.2014.0971		Insects	Hymenoptera	Cataglyphis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE

Multilocus Analysis of Divergence and Introgression in Sympatric and Allopatric Sibling Species of the Lutzomyia longipalpis Complex in Brazil	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES	Background: Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Latin America, is a complex of sibling species. In Brazil, a number of very closely related sibling species have been revealed by the analyses of copulation songs, sex pheromones and molecular markers. However, the level of divergence and gene flow between the sibling species remains unclear. Brazilian populations of this vector can be divided in two main groups: one producing Burst-type songs and the Cembrene-1 pheromone and a second more diverse group producing various Pulse song subtypes and different pheromones. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed 21 nuclear loci in two pairs of Brazilian populations: two sympatric populations from the Sobral locality (1S and 2S) in northeastern Brazil and two allopatric populations from the Lapinha and Pancas localities in southeastern Brazil. Pancas and Sobral 2S are populations of the Burst/Cembrene-1 species while Lapinha and Sobral 1S are two putative incipient species producing the same pheromone and similar Pulse song subtypes. The multilocus analysis strongly suggests the occurrence of gene flow during the divergence between the sibling species, with different levels of introgression between loci. Moreover, this differential introgression is asymmetrical, with estimated gene flow being higher in the direction of the Burst/Cembrene-1 species. Conclusions/Significance: The results indicate that introgressive hybridization has been a crucial phenomenon in shaping the genome of the L. longipalpis complex. This has possible epidemiological implications and is particularly interesting considering the potential for increased introgression caused by man-made environmental changes and the current trend of leishmaniasis urbanization in Brazil.	2013	10.1371/journal.pntd.0002495		Insects	Diptera	Lutzomyia	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (24 loci)	TRUE

Kastally, Chedly; Trasoletti, Marta; Mardulyn, Patrick	Limited gene exchange between two sister species of leaf beetles within a hybrid zone in the Alps	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Analysing genomic variation within and between sister species is a first step towards understanding species boundaries. We focused on two sister species of cold-resistant leaf beetles, Gonioctena quinquepunctata and G. intermedia, whose ranges overlap in the Alps. A previous study of DNA sequence variation had revealed multiple instances of mitochondrial genome introgression in this region, suggesting recent hybridization between the two species. To evaluate the extent of gene exchange resulting from these hybridization events, we sampled individuals of both species inside and outside the hybrid zone and analysed genomic variation among them using RAD-seq markers. Individual levels of introgression in the nuclear genome were estimated first by defining species-specific SNPs (displaying a fixed difference between species) a priori and second by using model-based methods. Both types of analyses indicated little gene exchange, if any, between species at the level of the nuclear genome. Whereas the first method suggested slightly more gene flow, we argue that it has likely overestimated introgression in the phylogeographic context of this study. We conclude that strong intrinsic barriers prevent genetic exchange at the level of the nuclear genome between the two species. The apparent discrepancy observed between introgression occurring in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes could be explained by selection acting in favour of the latter. Also, these results have consequences for the phylogeographic study of each species, since we can assume that genetic diversity in the overlapping portion of their ranges is not the product of introgression.		10.1111/jeb.13538		Insects	Coleoptera	Gonioctena	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	fastStructure, newhybrids, trees	RAD (131000 loci)	TRUE

The physically unlinked centromeric regions on all three chromosomes of these closely related taxa contain fixed nucleotide differences which have been found in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium in geographic areas of no or low M-S hybridization. Assays diagnostic for SNP and structural differences between M and S forms in the three centromeric regions were applied in samples from the western extreme of their range of sympatry, the only area where high frequencies of putative M/S hybrids have been reported. The results reveal a level of admixture not observed in the rest of the range. In particular, we found: i) heterozygous genotypes at each marker, although at frequencies lower than expected under panmixia; ii) virtually all possible genotypic combinations between markers on different chromosomes, although genetic association was nevertheless detected; iii) discordant M and S genotypes at two X-linked markers near the centromere, suggestive of introgression and inter-locus recombination. These results could be indicative either of a secondary contact zone between M and S, or of the maintenance of ancestral polymorphisms. This issue and the perspectives opened by these results in the study of the M and S incipient speciation process are discussed.	2011	10.1371/journal.pone.0016415		Insects	Diptera	Anopheles	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity	RFLP	TRUE

Selective sweeps on novel and introgressed variation shape mimicry loci in a butterfly adaptive radiation	PLOS BIOLOGY	Natural selection leaves distinct signatures in the genome that can reveal the targets and history of adaptive evolution. By analysing high-coverage genome sequence data from 4 major colour pattern loci sampled from nearly 600 individuals in 53 populations, we show pervasive selection on wing patterns in the Heliconius adaptive radiation. The strongest signatures correspond to loci with the greatest phenotypic effects, consistent with visual selection by predators, and are found in colour patterns with geographically restricted distributions. These recent sweeps are similar between co-mimics and indicate colour pattern turn-over events despite strong stabilising selection. Using simulations, we compare sweep signatures expected under classic hard sweeps with those resulting from adaptive introgression, an important aspect of mimicry evolution in Heliconius butterflies. Simulated recipient populations show a distinct 'volcano' pattern with peaks of increased genetic diversity around the selected target, characteristic of sweeps of introgressed variation and consistent with diversity patterns found in some populations. Our genomic data reveal a surprisingly dynamic history of colour pattern selection and co-evolution in this adaptive radiation.	2020	10.1371/journal.pbio.3000597		Insects	Lepidoptera	Heliconius	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats 	TRUE	demography, trees, simulations	WGS	TRUE

Secondary contact between Lycaeides idas and L-melissa in the Rocky Mountains: extensive admixture and a patchy hybrid zone	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Studies of hybridization have increased our understanding of the nature of species boundaries, the process of speciation, and the effects of hybridization on the evolution of populations and species. In the present study we use genetic and morphological data to determine the outcome and consequences of secondary contact and hybridization between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa in the Rocky Mountains. Admixture proportions estimated from structure and geographical cline analysis indicate L. idas and L. melissa have hybridized extensively in the Rocky Mountains and that reproductive isolation was insufficient to prevent introgression for much of the genome. Geographical patterns of admixture suggest that hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa has led to the formation of a hybrid zone. The hybrid zone is relatively wide, given estimates of dispersal for Lycaeides butterflies, and does not show strong evidence of cline concordance among characters. We believe the structure of the Lycaeides hybrid zone might be best explained by the patchy distribution of Lycaeides, local extinction and colonization of habitat patches, environmental variation and weak overall selection against hybrids. We found no evidence that hybridization in the Rocky Mountains has resulted in the formation of independent hybrid species, in contrast to the outcome of hybridization between L. idas and L. melissa in the Sierra Nevada. Finally, our results suggest that differences in male morphology between L. idas and L. melissa might contribute to isolation, or perhaps even that selection has favoured the spread of L. melissa male genitalia alleles.	2010	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04727.x		Insects	Lepidoptera	Lycaeides	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	structure, clines	microsattelites (4 markers), AFLP (360 markers)	TRUE	
Masly, John P.; Dalton, Justin E.; Srivastava, Sudeep; Chen, Liang; Arbeitman, Michelle N.	The Genetic Basis of Rapidly Evolving Male Genital Morphology in Drosophila	GENETICS	The external genitalia are some of the most rapidly evolving morphological structures in insects. The posterior lobe of the male genital arch shows striking differences in both size and shape among closely related species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. Here, we dissect the genetic basis of posterior lobe morphology between D. mauritiana and D. sechellia, two island endemic species that last shared a common ancestor similar to 300,000 years ago. We test a large collection of genome-wide homozygous D. mauritiana genetic introgressions, which collectively cover similar to 50% of the genome, for their morphological effects when placed in a D. sechellia genetic background. We find several introgressions that have large effects on posterior lobe morphology and that posterior lobe size and posterior lobe shape can be separated genetically for some of the loci that specify morphology. Using next generation sequencing technology, we perform whole transcriptome gene expression analyses of the larval genital imaginal disc of D. mauritiana, D. sechellia, and two D. mauritiana-D. sechellia hybrid introgression genotypes that each have large effects on either posterior lobe size or posterior lobe shape. Many of the genes we identify as differentially expressed are expressed at levels similar to D. mauritiana in one introgression hybrid, but are expressed at levels similar to D. sechellia in the other introgression hybrid. However, we also find that both introgression hybrids express some of the same genes at levels similar to D. mauritiana, and notably, that both introgression hybrids possess genes in the insulin receptor signaling pathway, which are expressed at D. mauritiana expression levels. These results suggest the possibility that the insulin signaling pathway might integrate size and shape genetic inputs to establish differences in overall posterior lobe morphology between D. mauritiana and D. sechellia.	2011	10.1534/genetics.111.130815		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	TRUE	morphology, sequence similarity	microarray (16420 loci), transcriptome	TRUE

We investigated the extent, causes and consequences of a hybrid zone between Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae in Guinea-Bissau, where high hybridisation rates appear to be stable at least since the 1990s. Anopheles gambiae was genetically partitioned into inland and coastal subpopulations, separated by a central region dominated by A. coluzzii. Surprisingly, whole genome sequencing revealed that the coastal region harbours a hybrid form characterised by an A. gambiae-like sex chromosome and massive introgression of A. coluzzii autosomal alleles. Local selection on chromosomal inversions may play a role in this process, suggesting potential for spatiotemporal stability of the coastal hybrid form and providing resilience against introgression of medically-important loci and traits, found to be more prevalent in inland A. gambiae.	2017	10.1038/srep46451		Insects	Diptera	Anopheles	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	STRUCTURE	microsattelites (19), WGS, karyotypes	TRUE

Beyond barcoding: A mitochondrial genomics approach to molecular phylogenetics and diagnostics of blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae)	GENE	Members of the Calliphoridae (blowflies) are significant for medical and veterinary management, due to the ability of some species to consume living flesh as larvae, and for forensic investigations due to the ability of others to develop in corpses. Due to the difficulty of accurately identifying larval blowflies to species there is a need for DNA-based diagnostics for this family, however the widely used DNA-barcoding marker, cox1, has been shown to fail for several groups within this family. Additionally, many phylogenetic relationships within the Calliphoridae are still unresolved, particularly deeper level relationships. Sequencing whole mt genomes has been demonstrated both as an effective method for identifying the most informative diagnostic markers and for resolving phylogenetic relationships. Twenty-seven complete, or nearly so, mt genomes were sequenced representing 13 species, seven genera and four calliphorid subfamilies and a member of the related family Tachinidae. PCR and sequencing primers developed for sequencing one calliphorid species could be reused to sequence related species within the same superfamily with success rates ranging from 61% to 100%, demonstrating the speed and efficiency with which an mt genome dataset can be assembled. Comparison of molecular divergences for each of the 13 protein-coding genes and 2 ribosomal RNA genes, at a range of taxonomic scales identified novel targets for developing as diagnostic markers which were 117-200% more variable than the markers which have been used previously in calliphorids. Phylogenetic analysis of whole mt genome sequences resulted in much stronger support for family and subfamily-level relationships. The Calliphoridae are polyphyletic, with the Polleninae more closely related to the Tachinidae, and the Sarcophagidae are the sister group of the remaining calliphorids. Within the Calliphoridae, there was strong support for the monophyly of the Chrysomyinae and Luciliinae and for the sister-grouping of Luciliinae with Calliphorinae. Relationships within Chrysomya were not well resolved. Whole mt genome data, supported the previously demonstrated paraphyly of Lucilia cuprina with respect to L sericata and allowed us to conclude that it is due to hybrid introgression prior to the last common ancestor of modern sericata populations, rather than due to recent hybridisation, nuclear pseudogenes or incomplete lineage sorting.

Aruna, S.; Ranganath, H. A.	Introgressive hybridization and evolution of a novel protein phenotype: glue protein profiles in the nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Glue proteins are tissue-specific proteins synthesized by larval salivary gland cells of Drosophila. In Drosophila nasuta nasuta and D. n. albomicans of the nasuta subgroup, the genes that encode the major glue protein fractions are X-linked. In the present study, these X-linked markers have been employed to trace the pattern of introgression of D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans genomes with respect to the major glue protein fractions in their interracial hybrids, called cytoraces. These cytoraces have inherited the chromosomes of both parents and have been maintained in the laboratory for over 400-550 generations. The analysis has revealed that cytoraces with D. n. albomicans X chromosome show either D. n. nasuta pattern or a completely novel pattern of glue protein fractions. Further, quantitative analysis also shows lack of correlation between the chromosomal. pattern of inheritance and overall quantity of the major glue protein fractions in the cytoraces. Thus, in cytoraces the parental chromosomes are not just differentially represented but there is evidence for introgression even at the gene level.	2006	10.1007/BF02728966		Insects	Diptera	Drosophila	TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	TRUE	sequence similarity	protein gels (5 loci)	TRUE	
Darling, John A.	Interspecific Hybridization and Mitochondrial Introgression in Invasive Carcinus Shore Crabs	PLOS ONE	Interspecific hybridization plays an important role in facilitating adaptive evolutionary change. More specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that hybridization may dramatically influence the establishment, spread, and impact of invasive populations. In Japan, previous genetic evidence for the presence of two non-native congeners, the European green crab Carcinus maenas and the Mediterranean green crab C. aestuarii, has raised questions regarding the possibility of hybridization between these sister species. Here I present analysis based on both nuclear microsatellites and the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene which unambiguously argues for a hybrid origin of Japanese Carcinus. Despite the presence of mitochondrial lineages derived from both C. maenas and C. aestuarii, the Japanese population is panmictic at nuclear loci and has achieved cytonuclear equilibrium throughout the sampled range in Japan. Furthermore, analysis of admixture at nuclear loci indicates dramatic introgression of the C. maenas mitochondrial genome into a predominantly C. aestuarii nuclear background. These patterns, along with inferences drawn from the observational record, argue for a hybridization event pre-dating the arrival of Carcinus in Japan. The clarification of both invasion history and evolutionary history afforded by genetic analysis provides information that may be critically important to future studies aimed at assessing risks posed by invasive Carcinus populations to Japan and the surrounding region.	2011	10.1371/journal.pone.0017828		Crustacean	Decapoda	Carcinus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression just detected it	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Fraisse, Christelle; Roux, Camille; Welch, John J.; Bierne, Nicolas	Gene-Flow in a Mosaic Hybrid Zone: Is Local Introgression Adaptive?	GENETICS	Genome-wide scans of genetic differentiation between hybridizing taxa can identify genome regions with unusual rates of introgression. Regions of high differentiation might represent barriers to gene flow, while regions of low differentiation might indicate adaptive introgression-the spread of selectively beneficial alleles between reproductively isolated genetic backgrounds. Here we conduct a scan for unusual patterns of differentiation in a mosaic hybrid zone between two mussel species, Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis. One outlying locus, mac-1, showed a characteristic footprint of local introgression, with abnormally high frequency of edulis-derived alleles in a patch of M. galloprovincialis enclosed within the mosaic zone, but low frequencies outside of the zone. Further analysis of DNA sequences showed that almost all of the edulis allelic diversity had introgressed into the M. galloprovincialis background in this patch. We then used a variety of approaches to test the hypothesis that there had been adaptive introgression at mac-1. Simulations and model fitting with maximum-likelihood and approximate Bayesian computation approaches suggested that adaptive introgression could generate a "soft sweep," which was qualitatively consistent with our data. Although the migration rate required was high, it was compatible with the functioning of an effective barrier to gene flow as revealed by demographic inferences. As such, adaptive introgression could explain both the reduced intraspecific differentiation around mac-1 and the high diversity of introgressed alleles, although a localized change in barrier strength may also be invoked. Together, our results emphasize the need to account for the complex history of secondary contacts in interpreting outlier loci.	2014	10.1534/genetics.114.161380		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Strelkov, Petr; Nikula, Raisa; Vainola, Risto	Macoma balthica in the White and Barents Seas: properties of a widespread marine hybrid swarm (Mollusca : Bivalvia)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	A main molecular subdivision in the circumpolar Macoma balthica complex has been described between Atlantic and Pacific taxa. In NE Europe, the clams of the White and Barents Seas, however, show deviant genetic structures. Using allozyme and mitochondrial DNA data, we explore the hypothesis that these deviations result from hybridization between an Atlantic (M. b. rubra) and an invading Pacific (M. b. balthica) lineage. A practically pure Atlantic Macoma extends from France north to the Varanger Peninsula (NE Norway), whereas populations farther east have genetic compositions intermediate between true Atlantic and true Pacific. Admixture estimates range from 32 to 90% Pacific contribution, with a notable deviation in a nearly pure Atlantic outpost in the Mezen Bay (NE White Sea). The pattern of variation is not one of a simple collinear mixing however. Different characters exhibit different degrees of introgression, and the relative introgression varies regionally. Yet, there are practically no interlocus genotypic disequilibria between the diverged loci, which brings out the White Sea-Barents Sea M. balthica as the best-documented marine animal hybrid swarms so far, arisen through amalgamation of genomes previously isolated since pre-Pleistocene times. On top of the main admixture pattern, strong geographical structuring is also seen in characters unrelated to the principal systematic distinction. The persistence of the regional patterns indicates restricted gene flow at the present time, despite the high dispersal potential of the species. The causes of this structuring could be in a complex history of colonization events and features of local hydrography enhancing isolation and divergence of populations.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03463.x		Mollusc	Cardiida	Macoma	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

C.	Ancient Hybridization and Adaptive Introgression of an Invadolysin Gene in Schistosome Parasites	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Introgression among parasite species has the potential to transfer traits of biomedical importance across species boundaries. The parasitic blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis in humans across sub-Saharan Africa. Hybridization with other schistosome species is assumed to occur commonly, because genetic crosses between S. haematobium and livestock schistosomes, including S. bovis, can be staged in the laboratory, and sequencing of mtDNA and rDNA amplified from microscopic miracidia larvae frequently reveals markers from different species. However, the frequency, direction, age, and genomic consequences of hybridization are unknown. We hatched miracidia from eggs and sequenced the exomes from 96 individual S. haematobium miracidia from infected patients from Niger and the Zanzibar archipelago. These data revealed no evidence for contemporary hybridization between S. bovis and S. haematobium in our samples. However, all Nigerien S. haematobium genomes sampled show hybrid ancestry, with 3.3-8.2% of their nuclear genomes derived from S. bovis, providing evidence of an ancient introgression event that occurred at least 108-613 generations ago. Some S. bovis-derived alleles have spread to high frequency or reached fixation and show strong signatures of directional selection; the strongest signal spans a single gene in the invadolysin gene family (Chr. 4). Our results suggest that S. bovis/S. haematobium hybridization occurs rarely but demonstrate profound consequences of ancient introgression from a livestock parasite into the genome of S. haematobium, the most prevalent schistosome species infecting humans.	2019	10.1093/molbev/msz154		Platyhelminthes	Diplostomida	Schistosoma	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	F3, PCA	exome (51000 loci)	TRUE	
Popovic, Iva; Matias, Ambrocio Melvin A.; Bierne, Nicolas; Riginos, Cynthia	Twin introductions by independent invader mussel lineages are both associated with recent admixture with a native congener in Australia	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Introduced species can impose profound impacts on the evolution of receiving communities with which they interact. If native and introduced taxa remain reproductively semi-isolated, human-mediated secondary contact may promote genetic exchange across newly created hybrid zones, potentially impacting native genetic diversity and invasive species spread. Here, we investigate the contributions of recent divergence histories and ongoing (post-introduction) gene flow between the invasive marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and a morphologically indistinguishable and taxonomically contentious native Australian taxon, Mytilus planulatus. Using transcriptome-wide markers, we demonstrate that two contemporary M. galloprovincialis introductions into south-eastern Australia originate from genetically divergent lineages from its native range in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Europe, where both introductions have led to repeated instances of admixture between introduced and endemic populations. Through increased genome-wide resolution of species relationships, combined with demographic modelling, we validate that mussels sampled in Tasmania are representative of the endemic Australian taxon (M. planulatus), but share strong genetic affinities to M. galloprovincialis. Demographic inferences indicate late-Pleistocene divergence times and historical gene flow between the Tasmanian endemic lineage and northern M. galloprovincialis, suggesting that native and introduced taxa have experienced a period of historical isolation of at least 100,000 years. Our results demonstrate that many genomic loci and sufficient sampling of closely related lineages in both sympatric (e.g. Australian populations) and allopatric (e.g. northern hemisphere Mytilus taxa) ranges are necessary to accurately (a) interpret patterns of intraspecific differentiation and to (b) distinguish contemporary invasive introgression from signatures left by recent divergence histories in high dispersal marine species. More broadly, our study fills a significant gap in systematic knowledge of native Australian biodiversity and sheds light on the intrinsic challenges for invasive species research when native and introduced species boundaries are not well defined.	2020	10.1111/eva.12857		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	demography, ADMIXTURE, trees	transcriptome (20000 loci)	TRUE	
Zbawicka, Malgorzata; Drywa, Agata; Smietanka, Beata; Wenne, Roman	Identification and validation of novel SNP markers in European populations of marine Mytilus mussels	MARINE BIOLOGY	Mussels of the genus Mytilus are widespread in both northern and southern hemispheres. Mytilus taxa are very important components of marine coastal ecosystems, but are difficult to differentiate morphologically. Sequencing and Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX genotyping technology was used to identify and verify novel SNP markers in three European taxa of Mytilus: M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and M. trossulus. SNPs were localized in coding and non-coding sequences of some functionally important genes. Eight SNPs located in genes of the histone family, hsp70 and p53, were discovered and applied as novel markers for Mytilus taxa on a large European scale. Five of these differentiated the M. trossulus genome, two M. galloprovincialis, and one M. edulis. Other SNPs differentiated populations within taxa. The new SNPs will be a valuable tool for population studies of European Mytilus mussels. The percentage of polymorphic SNPs ranged from 19 to 100 % in 24 samples of mussels studied. Populations from Scotland, Mecklenburg Bight, and Norway had over 90 % polymorphic loci. Most loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all samples except for the one from Scotland. The highest percentages of heterozygotes were observed in the Atlantic (Banyuls and Vigo) and North Sea (Tjarno and Westerschelde) populations. An excess of homozygotes was observed in samples from Scotland, Norway, and the Barents Sea. Correspondence and Structure analysis also demonstrated the great heterogeneity of these three samples.	2012	10.1007/s00227-012-1915-8		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Gosset, C. C.; Bierne, N.	Differential introgression from a sister species explains high FST outlier loci within a mussel species	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Scanning genomes for loci with high levels of population differentiation has become a standard of population genetics. FST outlier loci are most often interpreted as signatures of local selection, but outliers might arise for many other reasons too often left unexplored. Here, we tried to identify further the history and genetic basis underlying strong differentiation at FST outlier loci in a marine mussel. A genome scan of genetic differentiation has been conducted between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of Mytilus galloprovincialis. The differentiation was low overall (FST = 0.03), but seven loci (2%) were strong FST outliers. We then analysed DNA sequence polymorphism at two outlier loci. The genetic structure proved to be the consequence of differential introgression of alleles from the sister-hybridizing species Mytilus edulis. Surprisingly, the Mediterranean population was the most introgressed at these two loci, although the contact zone between the two species is nowadays localized along the Atlantic coasts of France and the British Isles. A historical contact between M. edulis and Mediterranean M. galloprovincialis should have happened during glacial periods. It proved difficult to disentangle two hypotheses: (i) introgression was adaptive, implying edulis alleles have been favoured in Mediterranean populations, or (ii) the genetic architecture of the barrier to edulis gene flow is different between the two M. galloprovincialis backgrounds. Five of the seven outliers between M. galloprovincialis populations were also outliers between M. edulis and Atlantic M. galloprovincialis, which would support the latter hypothesis. Differential introgression across semi-permeable barriers to gene flow is a neglected scenario to interpret outlying loci that may prove more widespread than anticipated.	2013	10.1111/jeb.12046		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Genetic architecture in a marine hybrid zone: comparing outlier detection and genomic clines analysis in the bivalve Macoma balthica	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The role of natural selection in speciation has received increasing attention and support in recent years. Different types of approaches have been developed that can detect genomic regions influenced by selection. Here, we address the question whether two highly different methodsFST outlier analysis and admixture analysisdetect largely the same set of non-neutral genomic elements or, instead, complementary sets. We study genetic architecture in a natural secondary contact zone where extensive admixture occurs. The marine bivalves Macoma balthica rubra and M. b. balthica descend from two independent trans-Arctic invasions of the north Atlantic and hybridize extensively where they meet, for example in the KattegatDanish StraitsBaltic Sea region. The KattegatDanish Straits region forms a steep salinity cline and is the only entrance to the recently (ca. 8000 years ago) established brackish water basin the Baltic Sea. Salinity along the contact zone drops from 30 parts per thousand (Skagerrak, M.b.rubra) to 3 parts per thousand(Baltic, M.b.balthica). Both outlier analysis and genomic clines analysis suggest that large parts of the genome are influenced by non-neutral effects. Contrasting samples from well outside the hybrid zone, outlier analysis detects 16 of 84 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers as significant FST outliers. Genomic clines analysis detects 31 of 84 markers as non-neutral inside the hybrid zone. Remarkably, only three markers are detected by both methods. We conclude that the two methods together identify a suite of markers that are under the influence of non-neutral effects.	2012	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05586.x		Mollusc	Cardiida	Macoma	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Pogson, Grant H.	Studying the genetic basis of speciation in high gene flow marine invertebrates	CURRENT ZOOLOGY	A growing number of genes responsible for reproductive incompatibilities between species (barrier loci) exhibit the signals of positive selection. However, the possibility that genes experiencing positive selection diverge early in speciation and commonly cause reproductive incompatibilities has not been systematically investigated on a genome-wide scale. Here, I outline a research program for studying the genetic basis of speciation in broadcast spawning marine invertebrates that uses a priori genome-wide information on a large, unbiased sample of genes tested for positive selection. A targeted sequence capture approach is proposed that scores single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in widely separated species populations at an early stage of allopatric divergence. The targeted capture of both coding and non-coding sequences enables SNPs to be characterized at known locations across the genome and at genes with known selective or neutral histories. The neutral coding and non-coding SNPs provide robust background distributions for identifying FST-outliers within genes that can, in principle, identify specific mutations experiencing diversifying selection. If natural hybridization occurs between species, the neutral coding and non-coding SNPs can provide a neutral admixture model for genomic clines analyses aimed at finding genes exhibiting strong blocks to introgression. Strongylocentrotid sea urchins are used as a model system to outline the approach but it can be used for any group that has a complete reference genome available.	2016	10.1093/cz/zow093		Echinoderm	Echinoidia	Strongylocentrotus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Stuckas, H.; Stoof, K.; Quesada, H.; Tiedemann, R.	Evolutionary implications of discordant clines across the Baltic Mytilus hybrid zone (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus)	HEREDITY	It is well established that reproductive isolation often arises from genome incompatibilities and that genes encoding reproductive traits are less prone to introgression. Hybrid zones of Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus edulis provide an intriguing model to assess reproductive isolation. Although gene flow is restricted in North America, introgression is pervasive in the Baltic. This study aimed at analyzing the shape of multilocus clines across the Baltic contact zone between M. edulis and M. trossulus to infer mechanisms of restriction to gene flow. We use maximum likelihood methods to construct the best fitting individual clines for five markers located on biparentally inherited autosomes and paternally and maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA). Strong cline shape differences among markers suggest that reproductive isolation arising from genome-wide incompatibilities is weak, and that these discrepancies possibly result from genetic drift, hybrid zone movement or marker-specific selection. However, the finding of a common cline center for M7 lysin ( involved in fertilization) and paternally transmitted mtDNA ( causing nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities in hybrids) suggest that these loci may play a role in incomplete reproductive isolation.

Gardner, J. P. A.; Wei, K-J	The genetic architecture of hybridisation between two lineages of greenshell mussels	HEREDITY	A multidisciplinary approach has identified sigmoidal genetic clines on the east and west coasts in central New Zealand where low-density ecological interactions occur between northern and southern lineages of the endemic greenshell mussel, Perna canaliculus. The sigmoidal clines indicate the existence of a mussel hybrid zone in a region of genetic discontinuities for many continuously distributed coastal taxa, in particular marine invertebrates. Examination of the genetic architecture of the hybrid zone revealed the differential contribution of individual microsatellite loci and/or alleles to defining the zone of interaction and no evidence of increased allelic richness or heterozygosity inside versus outside the hybrid zone. Genomics cline analysis identified one locus in particular (Pcan1-27) as being different from neutral expectations, thereby contributing to lineage differentiation. Estimates of contemporary gene flow revealed very high levels of within-lineage self-recruitment and a hybrid zone composed mostly (similar to 85%) of northern immigrants. Broad scale interpretation of these results is consistent with a zone of genetic interaction that was generated between 0.3 and 1.3 million years before present at a time of pronounced global sea-level change. At that time, the continuous distribution of the greenshell mussel was split into northern and southern groups, which differentiated to become distinct lineages, and which have subsequently been reunited (secondary contact) resulting in the generation of the hybrid zone at similar to 42 degrees S.	2015	10.1038/hdy.2014.108		Mollusc	Mytilida	Perna	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Tesfamariam Habtemariam, Bereket; Arias, Andres; Garcia-Vazquez, Eva; Juan Borrell, Yaisel	Impacts of supplementation aquaculture on the genetic diversity of wild Ruditapes decussatus from northern Spain	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS	The European carpet shell Ruditapes decussatus is among the most important shellfish species cultured in estuaries and bays of the northern Iberian Peninsula. Increased demand and overfishing of native R. decussatus, as well as irregular yields due in part to pollution and urban sprawl, have led to overexploitation of the species and to the import of the non-indigenous R. philippinarum in the early 1980s. In recent years, supplementation aquaculture of R. decussatus (supportive breeding) has been implemented as a management tool to recover the exhausted native carpet shell populations in Asturias, northern Spain. In this study, taxonomic analysis and a suite of genetic markers (ITS2, 5SrDNA, and mtCOI) were employed to assess the genetic composition of R. decussatus in 2 estuaries of the region, Ria del Eo and Ria de Villaviciosa. Our results revealed species misidentification and evidenced genetic introgression from the non-indigenous R. philippinarum into wild R. decussatus samples (4.2 %), as well as in the aquaculture seed used for population supplementation (2.0 %). Furthermore, we found significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.03750, p < 0.0001) between wild populations and aquaculture seed, while the adults of both estuaries were genetically homogeneous (p > 0.05). Several actions are strongly recommended to prevent inadvertent introduction of non-indigenous genomes and other genetic erosive processes on native species in the region: (1) banning releases of the alien species R. philippinarum, (2) developing diagnostic tests for detection of hybrids in captive breeding programs, and (3) assessing the conservation status of wild R. decussatus populations.	2015	10.3354/aei00128		Crustacean	Venerida	Ruditapes	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Kappas, Ilias; Baxevanis, Athanasios D.; Maniatsi, Stefania; Abatzopoulos, Theodore J.	Porous genomes and species integrity in the branchiopod Artemia	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Over the years, studies on interspecific hybridization have highlighted cases where gene exchange between taxa continues for a significant amount of time after speciation. The reasons for this lag of reproductive isolation relative to genetic isolation are largely unclear, and the question still remains whether the resulting hybrids represent novel biological (and taxonomic) diversity or merely an evolutionary liability. We provide strong indications in the branchiopod Artemia that hybrids between distantly related species may not be evolutionary inconsequential. Based on a global sampling of published and newly derived nuclear (ITS1) and mitochondrial (16S rRNA) sequence data from all representatives of the genus, we have identified natural hybrids between Artemia species (A. persimilis x A franciscana, A. salina x A franciscana) separated by evolutionary interludes of tens of millions of years. our combined analytical framework of cladistic and network methods provides evidence that hybridizations are the result of recent secondary contact following pronounced allopatric differentiation. The detection of mitochondrial introgression from A persimilis to A franciscana attests F-1 hybrid fertility. The reasons for this apparent unidirectionality of introgression are currently unknown but a likely explanation is provided based on morphometric divergence. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our results within the broader context of continental zooplankters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Dunams-Morel, Detiger B.; Reichard, Mason V.; Torretti, Luigi; Zarlenga, Dante S.; Rosenthal, Benjamin M.	Discernible but limited introgression has occurred where Trichinella nativa and the T6 genotype occur in sympatry	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION	The genetic diversity within and among parasite populations provides clues to their evolutionary history. Here, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA variation could be used to evaluate the extent of differentiation, gene flow and historical reproductive isolation among the freeze resistant parasites Trichinella nativa and the Trichinella T6 genotype infecting wolverines (Cub gulo) in Nunavut, Canada. To this end, we genotyped Trichinella isolates derived from the diaphragms of 39 wolverines from this locale to reference strains of T. nativa and the Trichinella T6 genotype. Results showed that among a subset of 13 isolates examined, individuals resembled T. nativa in their mitochondrial DNA, but resembled the Trichinella T6 genotype when assayed at expansion segment V and the internal transcribed spacer of themuclear rDNA. To adjudicate among these conflicting diagnoses, we further characterized each isolate at several nuclear microsatellite loci and again compared these to data from reference strains. Statistical assignment established that the nuclear genomes of most Nunavut isolates corresponded to those of the Trichinella T6 genotype; however, two isolates corresponded to T. nativa, and one isolate exhibited equal similarity to both reference strains. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that these isolates derive from the T. nativa matrilineage, but that their nuclear genomes resemble individuals previously designated as Trichinella T6. Assuming distinct lineages, this argues for cross-hybridization among these genotypes. Although introgression has occurred, recognizable genetic distinctions persist. One possibility is that selection disfavors the survival of hybrid offspring in most instances. Alternatively, the recent disappearance of glacial barriers might have increased contact, and therefore introgression. Broader geographic sampling will be required to determine the extent to which hybridization occurs beyond this particular geographic focus.

Franssen, Frits; Bilska-Zajac, Ewa; Deksne, Gunita; Sprong, Hein; Pozio, Edoardo; Rosenthal, Benjamin; Rozycki, Mirek; van der Giessen, Joke	Genetic evidence of interspecies introgression of mitochondrial genomes between Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi under natural conditions	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Trichinellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Trichinella muscle larvae (ML) through ingestion of raw or undercooked meat. To date, 12 taxa are recognized in this genus, of which four are circulating in Europe (Trichinella spiralis, Trichinella nativa, Trichinella britovi and Trichinella pseudospiralis). T. spiralis and T. britovi circulate in European wildlife and occur simultaneously in the same host species. The possibility of hybrid formation between T. britovi and T. spiralis has hardly been addressed and so far, results of experimental hybridisation attempts between T. britovi and T. spiralis are inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to analyse molecular polymorphisms of single T. spiralis and T. britovi ML from natural infections based on nuclear 5S rDNA intergenic spacer region (5S rDNA-ISR) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene sequences. Six haplotypes of the 5S rDNA intergenic spacer region (5S rDNA-ISR) and 14 of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene were demonstrated in 89 individual T. britovi ML from Latvia and Poland. In contrast, only two haplotypes were observed at both 5S rDNA-ISR and CO1 of 57 individual T. spiralis ML from Polish wild boar and red foxes. Moreover, this study demonstrates hybridisation in eight individual ML between T. britovi and T. spiralis under natural conditions in four Polish wild boar and two red foxes, revealed by combining 5S rDNA-ISR and CO1 sequence information of individual Trichinella ML. To our knowledge, this is the first report of interspecies hybridisation between T. spiralis and T. britovi under field conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Galindo, J.; Martinez-Fernandez, M.; Rodriguez-Ramilo, S. T.; Rolan-Alvarez, E.	The role of local ecology during hybridization at the initial stages of ecological speciation in a marine snail	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Hybrid zones of ecologically divergent populations are ideal systems to study the interaction between natural selection and gene flow during the initial stages of speciation. Here, we perform an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scan in parallel hybrid zones between divergent ecotypes of the marine snail Littorina saxatilis, which is considered a model case for the study of ecological speciation. Ridged-Banded (RB) and Smooth-Unbanded (SU) ecotypes are adapted to different shore levels and microhabitats, although they present a sympatric distribution at the mid-shore where they meet and mate (partially assortatively). We used shell morphology, outlier and nonoutlier AFLP loci from RB, SU and hybrid specimens captured in sympatry to determine the level of phenotypic and genetic introgression. We found different levels of introgression at parallel hybrid zones and nonoutlier loci showed more gene flow with greater phenotypic introgression. These results were independent from the phylogeography of the studied populations, but not from the local ecological conditions. Genetic variation at outlier loci was highly correlated with phenotypic variation. In addition, we used the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation to estimate the heritability of morphological traits and to identify potential Quantitative Trait Loci to be confirmed in future crosses. These results suggest that ecology (exogenous selection) plays an important role in this hybrid zone. Thus, ecologically based divergent natural selection is responsible, simultaneously, for both ecotype divergence and hybridization. On the other hand, genetic introgression occurs only at neutral loci (nonoutliers). In the future, genome-wide studies and controlled crosses would give more valuable information about this process of speciation in the face of gene flow.	2013	10.1111/jeb.12152		Mollusc	Littorinimorpha	Littorina	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Fraisse, Christelle; Belkhir, Khalid; Welch, John J.; Bierne, Nicolas	Local interspecies introgression is the main cause of extreme levels of intraspecific differentiation in mussels	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Structured populations, and replicated zones of contact between species, are an ideal opportunity to study regions of the genome with unusual levels of differentiation; and these can illuminate the genomic architecture of species isolation, and the spread of adaptive alleles across species ranges. Here, we investigated the effects of gene flow on divergence and adaptation in the Mytilus complex of species, including replicated parental populations in quite distant geographical locations. We used target enrichment sequencing of 1269 contigs of a few kb each, including some genes of known function, to infer gene genealogies at a small chromosomal scale. We show that geography is an important determinant of the genomewide patterns of introgression in Mytilus and that gene flow between different species, with contiguous ranges, explained up to half of the intraspecific outliers. This suggests that local introgression is both widespread and tends to affect larger chromosomal regions than purely intraspecific processes. We argue that this situation might be common, and this implies that genome scans should always consider the possibility of introgression from sister species, unsampled differentiated backgrounds, or even extinct relatives, for example Neanderthals in humans. The hypothesis that reticulate evolution over long periods of time contributes widely to adaptation, and to the spatial and genomic reorganization of genetic backgrounds, needs to be more widely considered to make better sense of genome scans.	2016	10.1111/mec.13299		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Zbawicka, Malgorzata; Gardner, Jonathan P. A.; Wenne, Roman	Cryptic diversity in smooth-shelled mussels on Southern Ocean islands: connectivity, hybridisation and a marine invasion	FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY	Background Large numbers of endemic species inhabit subantarctic continental coasts and islands that are characterised by highly variable environmental conditions. Southern hemisphere populations of taxa that are morphologically similar to northern counterparts have traditionally been considered to be extensions of such Northern hemisphere taxa, and may not exhibit differentiation amongst geographically isolated populations in the Southern Ocean. Smooth-shelled blue mussels of the genus Mytilus that exhibit an anti-tropical distribution are a model group to study phylogeography, speciation and hybridisation in the sea, and contribute to the theory and practice of marine biosecurity. Methods We used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) panel that has the ability to accurately identify reference Northern and Southern hemisphere Mytilus taxa to test for evolutionary differentiation amongst native Southern Ocean island populations. Results Native mussels from the Falkland Islands and the Kerguelen Islands exhibited greatest affinity to native M. platensis d'Orbigny 1846 from the Atlantic coast of South America. The major Southern Ocean current flow from west to east is likely to explain the spreading of M. platensis to remote offshore islands, as adults via the process of rafting or perhaps directly as larvae. SNPs variation revealed that mussels from Tasmania were native and clearly differentiated from all other blue mussel groups in the Southern and Northern hemispheres. The native mussels M. planulatus from Tasmania and from mainland New Zealand (NZ), and tentatively M. aoteanus from the two NZ Southern Ocean offshore island groups (the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island), formed a distinct M. galloprovincialis-like Southern hemisphere group with closest affinity to Northern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis from the Mediterranean Sea. In all cases, the SNPs revealed evidence of hybridisation between two or more distinct taxa. The invasive Northern hemisphere M. galloprovincialis was identified only in Tasmania, amongst native mussels of a distinct Australian M. planulatus lineage. Conclusion Overall, our results reveal that Southern hemisphere island mussels have mixed genome ancestry and are native, not introduced by human activities. The preservation of distinct evolutionary lineages of Southern hemisphere species needs to be an ongoing focus of conservation efforts, given that population sizes on some of the remote offshore oceanic islands will be small and may be more easily adversely affected by invasion and subsequent hybridisation and introgression than larger populations elsewhere.	2019	10.1186/s12983-019-0332-y		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	detected introgression, not calculated it	TRUE	sequence similairty, trees, STRUCTURE, NewHybrids	SNP array (79 snps)	TRUE

Kijewski, T. K.; Zbawicka, M.; Vainola, R.; Wenne, R.	Introgression and mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in the Baltic populations of mussels Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus edulis	MARINE BIOLOGY	A strong clinal change in salinity occurs between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, in the Danish Straits, where hybridization zone between mussels Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus has been reported. Eleven samples of mussels were studied from the Danish Straits and the inner Baltic Sea. Extensive introgression of M. edulis alleles from the North Sea into populations throughout the Baltic was ascertained for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and two nuclear markers (ME15-16 and ITS). In the opposite direction, introgression of M. trossulus alleles into the M. edulis background was observed at the EFbis nuclear marker in populations from Kattegat (Danish Straits). While only M. edulis F (female) mtDNA was present in the Baltic, there were still strong differences in frequencies in the control region length variants between the Danish Straits and the inner Baltic samples, and weaker variation in coding region ND2-COIII haplotype frequencies. In the assays of the two mtDNA regions, various patterns of heteroplasmy were detected in 32% of all the studied individual mussels; this includes the presence of distinct, independently inherited M and F mitochondria in males, as well as the presence of two different distinguishable F genomes. The male-inherited M mtDNA genomes are quite common in the mussels from the Danish Straits, but very rare in males from the inner Baltic. Instead, a recombined control region variant (1r), which seems to have taken over the role of the M genome, was present in a number of specimens in the Baltic. Observations of heteroplasmy for two F genomes in some females and males confirm disruptions of the doubly uniparental inheritance mechanism in the hybrid Baltic Mytilus.	2006	10.1007/s00227-006-0316-2		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Roux, Camille; Tsagkogeorga, Georgia; Bierne, Nicolas; Galtier, Nicolas	Crossing the Species Barrier: Genomic Hotspots of Introgression between Two Highly Divergent Ciona intestinalis Species	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Inferring a realistic demographic model from genetic data is an important challenge to gain insights into the historical events during the speciation process and to detect molecular signatures of selection along genomes. Recent advances in divergence population genetics have reported that speciation in face of gene flow occurred more frequently than theoretically expected, but the approaches used did not account for genome-wide heterogeneity (GWH) in introgression rates. Here, we investigate the impact of GWH on the inference of divergence with gene flow between two cryptic species of the marine model Ciona intestinalis by analyzing polymorphism and divergence patterns in 852 protein-coding sequence loci. These morphologically similar entities are highly diverged molecular-wise, but evidence of hybridization has been reported in both laboratory and field studies. We compare various speciation models and test for GWH under the approximate Bayesian computation framework. Our results demonstrate the presence of significant extents of gene flow resulting from a recent secondary contact after > 3 My of divergence in isolation. The inferred rates of introgression are relatively low, highly variable across loci and mostly unidirectional, which is consistent with the idea that numerous genetic incompatibilities have accumulated over time throughout the genomes of these highly diverged species. A genomic map of the level of gene flow identified two hotspots of introgression, that is, large genome regions of unidirectional introgression. This study clarifies the history and degree of isolation of two cryptic and partially sympatric model species and provides a methodological framework to investigate GWH at various stages of speciation process.	2013	10.1093/molbev/mst066		Tunicate	Enterogona	Ciona	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

When similar introductions occur in different places, they provide informally replicated experiments for studying hybridisation. We here examined 4,279 Mytilus mussels, sampled in Europe and genotyped with 77 ancestry-informative markers. We identified a type of introduced mussels, called "dock mussels," associated with port habitats and displaying a particular genetic signal of admixture between M. edulis and the Mediterranean lineage of M. galloprovincialis. These mussels exhibit similarities in their ancestry compositions, regardless of the local native genetic backgrounds and the distance separating colonised ports. We observed fine-scale genetic shifts at the port entrance, at scales below natural dispersal distance. Such sharp clines do not fit with migration-selection tension zone models, and instead suggest habitat choice and early-stage adaptation to the port environment, possibly coupled with connectivity barriers. Variations in the spread and admixture patterns of dock mussels seem to be influenced by the local native genetic backgrounds encountered. We next examined departures from the average admixture rate at different loci, and compared human-mediated admixture events, to naturally admixed populations and experimental crosses. When the same M. galloprovincialis background was involved, positive correlations in the departures of loci across locations were found; but when different backgrounds were involved, no or negative correlations were observed. While some observed positive correlations might be best explained by a shared history and saltatory colonisation, others are likely produced by parallel selective events. Altogether, genome-wide effect of admixture seems repeatable and more dependent on genetic background than environmental context. Our results pave the way towards further genomic analyses of admixture, and monitoring of the spread of dock mussels both at large and at fine spacial scales.	2020	10.1111/eva.12879		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Bouchemousse, Sarah; Liautard-Haag, Cathy; Bierne, Nicolas; Viard, Frederique	Distinguishing contemporary hybridization from past introgression with postgenomic ancestry-informative SNPs in strongly differentiated Ciona species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Biological introductions bring into contact species that can still hybridize. The evolutionary outcomes of such secondary contacts may be diverse (e.g. adaptive introgression from or into the introduced species) but are not yet well examined in the wild. The recent secondary contact between the non-native sea squirt Ciona robusta (formerly known as C. intestinalis type A) and its native congener C. intestinalis (formerly known as C. intestinalis type B), in the Western English Channel, provides an excellent case study to examine. To examine contemporary hybridization between the two species, we developed a panel of 310 ancestry-informative SNPs from a population transcriptomic study. Hybridization rates were examined on 449 individuals sampled in eight sites from the sympatric range and five sites from allopatric ranges. The results clearly showed an almost complete absence of contemporary hybridization between the two species in syntopic localities, with only one-first-generation hybrid and no other genotype compatible with recent backcrosses. Despite the almost lack of contemporary hybridization, shared polymorphisms were observed in sympatric and allopatric populations of both species. Furthermore, one allopatric population from SE Pacific exhibited a higher rate of shared polymorphisms compared to all other C. robusta populations. Altogether, these results indicate that the observed level of shared polymorphism is more probably the outcome of ancient gene flow spread afterwards at a worldwide scale. They also emphasize efficient reproductive barriers preventing hybridization between introduced and native species, which suggests hybridization should not impede too much the expansion and the establishment of the non-native species in its introduction range.	2016	10.1111/mec.13854		Tunicate	Enterogona	Ciona	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

El Ayari, Tahani; El Menif, Najoua Trigui; Hamer, Bojan; Cahill, Abigail E.; Bierne, Nicolas	The hidden side of a major marine biogeographic boundary: a wide mosaic hybrid zone at the Atlantic-Mediterranean divide reveals the complex interaction between natural and genetic barriers in mussels	HEREDITY	The Almeria-Oran Front (AOF) is a recognised hotspot of genetic differentiation in the sea, with genetic discontinuities reported in more than 50 species. The AOF is a barrier to dispersal and an ecological boundary; both can determine the position of these genetic breaks. However, the maintenance of genetic differentiation is likely reinforced by genetic barriers. A general drawback of previous studies is an insufficient density of sampling sites at the transition zone, with a conspicuous lack of samples from the southern coastline. We analysed the fine-scale genetic structure in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis using a few ancestry-informative loci previously identified from genome scans. We discovered a 600-km-wide mosaic hybrid zone eastward of the AOF along the Algerian coasts. This mosaic zone provides a new twist to our understanding of the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition because it demonstrates that the two lineages can live in sympatry with ample opportunities to interbreed in a large area, but they hardly do so. This implies that some form of reproductive isolation must exist to maintain the two genetic backgrounds locally cohesive. The mosaic zone ends with an abrupt genetic shift at a barrier to dispersal in the Gulf of Bejaia, Eastern Algeria. Simulations of endogenous or exogenous selection in models that account for the geography and hydrodynamic features of the region support the hypothesis that sister hybrid zones could have been differentially trapped at two alternative barriers to dispersal and/or environmental boundaries, at Almeria in the north and Bejaia in the south. A preponderantly unidirectional north-south gene flow next to the AOF can also maintain a patch of intrinsically maintained genetic background in the south and the mosaic structure, even in the absence of local adaptation. Our results concur with the coupling hypothesis that suggests that natural barriers can explain the position of genetic breaks, while their maintenance depends on genetic barriers.	2019	10.1038/s41437-018-0174-y		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	detected introgression, not calculated it	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Koch, Eva L.; Neiber, Marco T.; Walther, Frank; Hausdorf, Bernhard	High gene flow despite opposite chirality in hybrid zones between enantiomorphic door snails	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	We studied differentiation and geneflow patterns between enantiomorphic door-snail species in two hybrid zones in the Bucegi Mountains (Romania) to investigate the effects of intrinsic barriers (complications in copulation) and extrinsic selection by environmental factors. A mitochondrial gene tree confirmed the historical separation of the examined populations into the dextral Alopia livida and the sinistral Alopia straminicollis in accordance with the morphological classification, but also indicated gene flow between the species. By contrast, a network based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers revealed local groups of populations as units independent of their species affiliation. Admixture analyses based on AFLP data showed that the genomes of most individuals in the hybrid zones are composed of parts of the genomes of both parental taxa. The introgression patterns of a notable fraction of the examined markers deviated from neutral introgression. However, the patterns of most non-neutral markers were not concordant between the two hybrid zones. There was also no concordance between non-neutral markers in the two genomic clines and markers that were correlated with environmental variables or markers that were correlated with the proportion of dextral individuals in the populations. Neither extrinsic selection by environmental factors nor intrinsic barriers resulting from positive frequency-dependent selection of the prevailing coiling direction were sufficient to maintain the distinctness of A. straminicollis and A. livida. Despite being historically separated units, we conclude that these taxa now merge where they come into contact.	2017	10.1111/mec.14159		Mollusc	Stylommatophora	Alopia	TRUE	TRUE	detected introgression, not calculated it	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines	AFLP (2836 markers), Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Bierne, N; Bonhomme, F; Boudry, P; Szulkin, M; David, P	Fitness landscapes support the dominance theory of post-zygotic isolation in the mussels Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	We studied the genetic basis of post-zygotic isolation in the marine mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis. Evidence was obtained for a high number of recessive Dobzhansky-Muller substitutions in the genome of these two mussel taxa. We analysed the segregation of unlinked diagnostic markers in the progeny of two backcrosses and an F-2 cross, 36 h and 200 days after fertilization. Directional selection favouring M. galloprovincialis genotypes was observed in both kinds of cross. In the F-2, epistatic interactions between each pair of chromosome fragments mapped by the markers were identified in addition. Our results imply that homozygous-homozygous interactions are required for breakdown of coadaptation, in accordance with the dominance theory of post-zygotic isolation. Endogenous post-zygotic selection distributed over many loci throughout the genome provides the missing factor explaining the astonishing persistence and strength of barriers to neutral introgression in such a dispersive taxon as Mytilus.	2006	10.1098/rspb.2005.3440		Mollusc	Mytilida	Mytilus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

An evaluation of genetic analyses, skull morphology and visual appearance for assessing dingo purity: implications for dingo conservation	WILDLIFE RESEARCH	The introgression of domestic dog genes into dingo populations threatens the genetic integrity of 'pure' dingoes. However, dingo conservation efforts are hampered by difficulties in distinguishing between dingoes and hybrids in the field. This study evaluates consistency in the status of hybridisation (i.e. dingo, hybrid or dog) assigned by genetic analyses, skull morphology and visual assessments. Of the 56 south-east Queensland animals sampled, 39 (69.6%) were assigned the same status by all three methods, 10 (17.9%) by genetic and skull methods, four (7.1%) by genetic and visual methods; and two (3.6%) by skull and visual methods. Pair-wise comparisons identified a significant relationship between genetic and skull methods, but not between either of these and visual methods. Results from surveying 13 experienced wild dog managers showed that hybrids were more easily identified by visual characters than were dingoes. A more reliable visual assessment can be developed through determining the relationship between (1) genetics and phenotype by sampling wild dog populations and (2) the expression of visual characteristics from different proportions and breeds of domestic dog genes by breeding trials. Culling obvious hybrids based on visual characteristics, such as sable and patchy coat colours, should slow the process of hybridisation.	2008	10.1071/WR07056		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	morphology, sequence similarity	microsatellite (22 loci)	TRUE	
Liu, Jiang; Yu, Li; Arnold, Michael L.; Wu, Chun-Hua; Wu, Shi-Fang; Lu, Xin; Zhang, Ya-Ping	Reticulate evolution: frequent introgressive hybridization among chinese hares (genus lepus) revealed by analyses of multiple mitochondrial and nuclear DNA loci	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Interspecific hybridization may lead to the introgression of genes and genomes across species barriers and contribute to a reticulate evolutionary pattern and thus taxonomic uncertainties. Since several previous studies have demonstrated that introgressive hybridization has occurred among some species within Lepus, therefore it is possible that introgressive hybridization events also occur among Chinese Lepus species and contribute to the current taxonomic confusion. Results: Data from four mtDNA genes, from 116 individuals, and one nuclear gene, from 119 individuals, provides the first evidence of frequent introgression events via historical and recent interspecific hybridizations among six Chinese Lepus species. Remarkably, the mtDNA of L. mandshuricus was completely replaced by mtDNA from L. timidus and L. sinensis. Analysis of the nuclear DNA sequence revealed a high proportion of heterozygous genotypes containing alleles from two divergent clades and that several haplotypes were shared among species, suggesting repeated and recent introgression. Furthermore, results from the present analyses suggest that Chinese hares belong to eight species. Conclusion: This study provides a framework for understanding the patterns of speciation and the taxonomy of this clade. The existence of morphological intermediates and atypical mitochondrial gene genealogies resulting from frequent hybridization events likely contribute to the current taxonomic confusion of Chinese hares. The present study also demonstrated that nuclear gene sequence could offer a powerful complementary data set with mtDNA in tracing a complete evolutionary history of recently diverged species.	2011	10.1186/1471-2148-11-223		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Lepus	TRUE	TRUE	ancient introgression through phylogentic analysis 	TRUE	trees	mtDNA (4 genes), Nuclear Marker (1 loucus)	TRUE

Genetic differentiation within and away from the chromosomal rearrangements characterising hybridising chromosomal races of the western house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus)	CHROMOSOME RESEARCH	The importance of chromosomal rearrangements for speciation can be inferred from studies of genetic exchange between hybridising chromosomal races within species. Reduced fertility or recombination suppression in karyotypic hybrids has the potential to maintain or promote genetic differentiation in genomic regions near rearrangement breakpoints. We studied genetic exchange between two hybridising groups of chromosomal races of house mouse in Upper Valtellina (Lombardy, Italy), using microsatellites. These groups differ by Robertsonian fusions and/or whole-arm reciprocal translocations such that F-1 hybrids have a chain-of-five meiotic configuration. Previous studies showed genetic differentiation in two chromosomes in the chain-of-five (10 and 12) close to their centromeres (i.e. the rearrangement breakpoints); we have shown here that the centromeric regions of the other two chromosomes in the chain (2 and 8) are similarly differentiated. The internal chromosomes of the chain (8 and 12) show the greatest differentiation, which may reflect pairing and recombination properties of internal and external elements in a meiotic chain. Importantly, we found that centromeric regions of some non-rearranged chromosomes also showed genetic differentiation between the hybridising groups, indicating a complex interplay between chromosomal rearrangements and other parts of the genome in maintaining or promoting differentiation and potentially driving speciation between chromosomal races.	2016	10.1007/s10577-016-9520-1		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	Used Fct statistic not D	TRUE	sequence similarity	microsatellites (42 loci)	TRUE

THE VARIABLE GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE OF ISOLATION BETWEEN HYBRIDIZING SPECIES OF HOUSE MICE	EVOLUTION	Studies of the genetics of hybrid zones can provide insight into the genomic architecture of species boundaries. By examining patterns of introgression of multiple loci across a hybrid zone, it may be possible to identify regions of the genome that have experienced selection. Here, we present a comparison of introgression in two replicate transects through the house mouse hybrid zone through central Europe, using data from 41 single nucleotide markers. Using both genomic and geographic clines, we found many differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, as well as some similarities. We found that many loci may have experienced the effects of selection at linked sites, including selection against hybrid genotypes, as well as positive selection in the form of genotypes introgressed into a foreign genetic background. We also found many positive associations of conspecific alleles among unlinked markers, which could be caused by epistatic interactions. Different patterns of introgression in the two transects highlight the challenge of using hybrid zones to identify genes underlying isolation and raise the possibility that the genetic basis of isolation between these species may be dependent on the local population genetic make-up or the local ecological setting.	2010	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00846.x		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	INTROGRESS, clines	Sanger (10 markers)	TRUE	
Stephens, Danielle; Wilton, Alan N.; Fleming, Peter J. S.; Berry, Oliver	Death by sex in an Australian icon: a continent-wide survey reveals extensive hybridization between dingoes and domestic dogs	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybridization between domesticated animals and their wild counterparts can disrupt adaptive gene combinations, reduce genetic diversity, extinguish wild populations and change ecosystem function. The dingo is a free-ranging dog that is an iconic apex predator and distributed throughout most of mainland Australia. Dingoes readily hybridize with domestic dogs, and in many Australian jurisdictions, distinct management strategies are dictated by hybrid status. Yet, the magnitude and spatial extent of domestic dog-dingo hybridization is poorly characterized. To address this, we performed a continent-wide analysis of hybridization throughout Australia based on 24 locus microsatellite DNA genotypes from 3637 free-ranging dogs. Although 46% of all free-ranging dogs were classified as pure dingoes, all regions exhibited some hybridization, and the magnitude varied substantially. The southeast of Australia was highly admixed, with 99% of animals being hybrids or feral domestic dogs, whereas only 13% of the animals from remote central Australia were hybrids. Almost all free-ranging dogs had some dingo ancestry, indicating that domestic dogs could have poor survivorship in nonurban Australian environments. Overall, wild pure dingoes remain the dominant predator over most of Australia, but the speed and extent to which hybridization has occurred in the approximately 220 years since the first introduction of domestic dogs indicate that the process may soon threaten the persistence of pure dingoes.	2015	10.1111/mec.13416		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	FALSE	did not calculate neceassary staistcs 	TRUE	sequence similarity, Hybridlab	microsattelites (24 loci)	TRUE

Oliveira, R.; Randi, E.; Mattucci, F.; Kurushima, J. D.; Lyons, L. A.; Alves, P. C.	Toward a genome-wide approach for detecting hybrids: informative SNPs to detect introgression between domestic cats and European wildcats (Felis silvestris)	HEREDITY	Endemic gene pools have been severely endangered by human-mediated hybridization, which is posing new challenges in the conservation of several vertebrate species. The endangered European wildcat is an example of this problem, as several natural populations are suffering introgression of genes from the domestic cat. The implementation of molecular methods for detecting hybridization is crucial for supporting appropriate conservation programs on the wildcat. In this study, genetic variation at 158 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was analyzed in 139 domestic cats, 130 putative European wildcats and 5 captive-bred hybrids (N = 274). These SNPs were variable both in wild (H-E = 0.107) and domestic cats (H-E = 0.340). Although we did not find any SNP that was private in any population, 22 SNPs were monomorphic in wildcats and pairwise F-CT values revealed marked differences between domestic and wildcats, with the most divergent 35 loci providing an average F-CT>0.74. The power of all the loci to accurately identify admixture events and discriminate the different hybrid categories was evaluated. Results from simulated and real genotypes show that the 158 SNPs provide successful estimates of admixture, with 100% hybrid individuals (two to three generations in the past) being correctly identified in STRUCTURE and over 92% using the NEWHYBRIDS' algorithm. None of the unclassified cats were wrongly allocated to another hybrid class. Thirty-five SNPs, showing the highest FCT values, provided the most parsimonious panel for robust inferences of parental and first generations of admixed ancestries. This approach may be used to further reconstruct the evolution of wildcat populations and, hopefully, to develop sound conservation guidelines for its legal protection in Europe.	2015	10.1038/hdy.2015.25		Mammals	Carnivora	Felis	TRUE	FALSE	did not calculate neceassary staistcs 	TRUE	NEWHYBRIDS, STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microarray (158 loci)	TRUE	
Zhang, Liangzhi; Jia, Shangang; Plath, Martin; Huang, Yongzhen; Li, Congjun; Lei, Chuzhao; Zhao, Xin; Chen, Hong	Impact of Parental Bos taurus and Bos indicus Origins on Copy Number Variation in Traditional Chinese Cattle Breeds	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Copy number variation (CNV) is an important component of genomic structural variation and plays a role not only in evolutionary diversification but also in domestication. Chinese cattle were derived from Bos taurus and Bos indicus, and several breeds presumably are of hybrid origin, but the evolution of CNV regions (CNVRs) has not yet been examined in this context. Here, we of CNVRs, mtDNA D-loop sequence variation, and Y-chromosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms to assess the impact of maternal and paternal B. taurus and B. indicus origins on the distribution of CNVRs in 24 Chinese domesticated bulls. We discovered 470 genome-wide CNVRs, only 72 of which were shared by all three Y-lineages (B. taurus: Y-1, Y-2; B. indicus: Y-3), whereas 265 were shared by inferred taurine or indicine paternal lineages, and 228 when considering their maternal taurine or indicine origins. Phylogenetic analysis uncovered eight taurine/indicine hybrids, and principal component analysis on CNVs corroborated genomic exchange during hybridization. The distribution patterns of CNVRs tended to be lineage-specific, and correlation analysis revealed significant positive or negative co-occurrences of CNVRs across lineages. Our study suggests that CNVs in Chinese cattle partly result from selective breeding during domestication, but also from hybridization and introgression.	2015	10.1093/gbe/evv151		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Bos	TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity, PCA	Sanger (2 genes), GCH (470 loci)	TRUE

Payseur, BA; Nachman, MW	The genomics of speciation: investigating the molecular correlates of X chromosome introgression across the hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and Mus musculus	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Understanding the genetic details of reproductive isolation is a key goal in the study of speciation. Hybrid zones, geographical regions where two species meet and exchange genes, can provide insight into the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. This is especially true in species with mapped molecular markers because patterns of gene flow can be compared among different genomic regions. Even greater insight can be obtained in species with complete genome sequences because gene identity, gene number and other features of interest can be assessed for genomic regions with different patterns of introgression. Here, we review recent studies on the well-characterized hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus, including a detailed survey of patterns of introgression for 13 markers on the X chromosome. We then compare levels of introgression for these 13 regions to a number of genomic attributes inferred from the complete sequence of the X chromosome, with two purposes. First, we identify candidate genes for reproductive isolation by finding genes that map to an X-linked region of reduced introgression and that are only expressed in the male germ line or that show high rates of protein evolution in comparison with rat. Second, we ask whether patterns of gene flow are correlated with recombination rate, gene density, base composition, CpG island density, mutation rate and the rate of protein evolution, as might be expected if many genes contribute to reproductive isolation. We identify seven candidate genes for reproductive isolation between M. domesticus and M. musculus, and our analyses reveal no general correlations between levels of introgression and other measured sequence characteristics. These results underline the utility of the house mouse as a model system for the study of speciation.

Macholan, Milos; Munclinger, Pavel; Sugerkova, Monika; Dufkova, Petra; Bimova, Barbora; Bozikova, Eva; Zima, Jan; Pialek, Jaroslav	Genetic analysis of autosomal and X-linked markers across a mouse hybrid zone	EVOLUTION	in this paper, we present results of the first comprehensive study of the introgression of both autosomal and sex-chromosome markers across the central European portion of the hybrid zone between two house mouse subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticurs. More than 1800 individuals sampled from 105 sites were analyzed with a set of allozyme loci (hopefully representing neutral or nearly neutral markers) and X-linked loci (which are assumed to be under selection). The zone center is best modeled as a single straight line independent of fine-scale local geographic or climatic conditions, being maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. The width (w) of the multilocus autosomal cline was estimated as 9.6 km whereas the estimate for the compound X-chromosome cline was about 4.6 km only. As the former estimate is comparable to that of the Danish portion of the zone (assumed to be much younger than the central European one), zone width does not appear to be related to its age. The strength (B) of the central barrier was estimated as about 20 km; with dispersal (sigma) of about 1 km/gen(1/2), this means effective selection (s*) is approximately 0.06-0.09 for autosomal loci and about 0.25 for X-linked loci. The number of loci under selection was estimated as N = 56-99 for autosomes and about 380 for X-linked loci. Finally, we highlight some potential pitfalls in hybrid zone analyses and in comparisons of different transects. We suggest that conclusions about parts of the mouse genome involved in reproductive isolation and speciation should be drawn with caution and that analytical approaches always providing some estimates should not be used without due care regarding the support or confidence of such estimates, especially if conclusions are based on the difference between these estimates. Finally, we recommend that analysis in two-dimensional space, dense sampling, and rigorous treatment of data, including inspection of likelihood profiles, are essential for hybrid zone studies.	2007	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00065.x		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	clines	markers (12 loci), allozymes (6 loci)	TRUE	
Raufaste, N; Orth, A; Belkhir, K; Senet, D; Smadja, C; Baird, SJE; Bonhomme, F; Dod, B; Boursot, P	Inferences of selection and migration in the Danish house mouse hybrid zone	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	We analysed the patterns of allele frequency change for ten diagnostic autosomal allozyme loci in the hybrid zone between the house mouse subspecies Mus musculus domesticus and M. in. musculus in central Jutland. After determining the general orientation of the clines of allele frequencies, we analysed the cline shapes along the direction of maximum gradient. Eight of the ten clines are best described by steep central steps with coincident positions and an average width of 8.9 km (support limits 7.6-12.4) flanked by tails of introgression, indicating the existence of a barrier to gene flow and only weak selection on the loci studied. We derived estimates of migration from linkage disequilibrium in the centre of the zone, and by applying isolation by distance methods to microsatellite data from some of these populations. These give concordant estimates of sigma = 0.5-0.8 km generation-(1)/(2). The barrier to gene flow is of the order of 20 kin (support limits 14-28), and could be explained by selection of a few per cent at 43-120 under-dominant loci that reduces the mean fitness in the central populations to 0.45. Some of the clines appear symmetrical, whereas others are strongly asymmetrical, and two loci appear to have escaped the central barrier to gene flow, reflecting the differential action of selection on different parts of the genome. Asymmetry is always in the direction of more introgression into Musculus, indicating either a general progression of domesticus into the musculus territory, possibly mediated by differential behaviour, or past movement of the hybrid zone in the opposite direction, impeded by potential geographical barriers to migration in domesticus territory.

Li, Gang; Davis, Brian W.; Eizirik, Eduardo; Murphy, William J.	Phylogenomic evidence for ancient hybridization in the genomes of living cats (Felidae)	GENOME RESEARCH	Inter-species hybridization has been recently recognized as potentially common in wild animals, but the extent to which it shapes modern genomes is still poorly understood. Distinguishing historical hybridization events from other processes leading to phylogenetic discordance among different markers requires a well-resolved species tree that considers all modes of inheritance and overcomes systematic problems due to rapid lineage diversification by sampling large genomic character sets. Here, we assessed genome-wide phylogenetic variation across a diverse mammalian family, Felidae (cats). We combined genotypes from a genome-wide SNP array with additional autosomal, X- and Y-linked variants to sample similar to 150 kb of nuclear sequence, in addition to complete mitochondrial genomes generated using light-coverage Illumina sequencing. We present the first robust felid time tree that accounts for unique maternal, paternal, and biparental evolutionary histories. Signatures of phylogenetic discordance were abundant in the genomes of modern cats, in many cases indicating hybridization as the most likely cause. Comparison of big cat whole-genome sequences revealed a substantial reduction of X-linked divergence times across several large recombination cold spots, which were highly enriched for signatures of selection-driven post-divergence hybridization between the ancestors of the snow leopard and lion lineages. These results highlight the mosaic origin of modern felid genomes and the influence of sex chromosomes and sex-biased dispersal in post-speciation gene flow. A complete resolution of the tree of life will require comprehensive genomic sampling of biparental and sex-limited genetic variation to identify and control for phylogenetic conflict caused by ancient admixture and sex-biased differences in genomic transmission.	2016	10.1101/gr.186668.114		Mammals	Carnivora	Felis	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	D statistics	WGS (63000 loci)	TRUE

Whole-genome sequence analysis shows that two endemic species of North American wolf are admixtures of the coyote and gray wolf	SCIENCE ADVANCES	Protection of populations comprising admixed genomes is a challenge under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which is regarded as the most powerful species protection legislation ever passed in the United States but lacks specific provisions for hybrids. The eastern wolf is a newly recognized wolf-like species that is highly admixed and inhabits the Great Lakes and eastern United States, a region previously thought to be included in the geographic range of only the gray wolf. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has argued that the presence of the eastern wolf, rather than the gray wolf, in this area is grounds for removing ESA protection (delisting) from the gray wolf across its geographic range. In contrast, the red wolf from the southeastern United States was one of the first species protected under the ESA and was protected despite admixture with coyotes. We use whole-genome sequence data to demonstrate a lack of unique ancestry in eastern and red wolves that would not be expected if they represented long divergent North American lineages. These results suggest that arguments for delisting the gray wolf are not valid. Our findings demonstrate how a strict designation of a species under the ESA that does not consider admixture can threaten the protection of endangered entities. We argue for a more balanced approach that focuses on the ecological context of admixture and allows for evolutionary processes to potentially restore historical patterns of genetic variation.	2016	10.1126/sciadv.1501714		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	Patterson's D, f^ , trees, demography	WGS	TRUE

Robinson, Terence J.; Ropiquet, Anne	Examination of Hemiplasy, Homoplasy and Phylogenetic Discordance in Chromosomal Evolution of the Bovidae	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	Robertsonian chromosomal fusions predominate in shaping the genomes of many species of Bovidae. These and other cytogenetic data (from 52 taxa representing 51 species and 9 tribes of Bovidae) were (i) examined for usefulness in defining phylogenetic relationships and (ii) subsequently mapped to a consensus tree based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA gene sequences with divergence dates of the corresponding species calculated from cytochrome b sequences. This permitted persistence time estimates for the various rearrangements. The chromosomal data resulted in an unsupported higher-level topology, but with recognition of the monophyly of some genera and tribes within Bovidae. The distribution and temporal spread of character states on the species tree is suggestive of a restricted role for hemiplasy (the retention of an ancestral chromosomal polymorphism through multiple speciation events) and for introgression (resulting from secondary contact among taxa), processes that can potentially lead to phylogenetic discordance. We conclude that the most probable interpretation for these data is that genuine karyotypic homoplasy predominates, but that hemiplasy (and/or introgression) is a realistic hypothesis for the observed patterns of several shared characters in Bovidae.	2011	10.1093/sysbio/syr045		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Bos	TRUE	TRUE	phylogentic analysis 	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE

They have been explained by the correlation between heterozygosity and inbreeding, and the negative effect of inbreeding on fitness (inbreeding depression). Exotic introgression in a locally adapted population has also been found to reduce fitness (outbreeding depression) through the breaking-up of co-adapted genes, or the introduction of non-locally adapted gene variants. In this study we examined the inter-relationships between genome-wide heterozygosity, introgression, and death or illness as a result of infectious disease in a sample of calves from an indigenous population of East African Shorthorn Zebu (crossbred Bos taurus x Bos indicus) in western Kenya. These calves were observed from birth to one year of age as part of the Infectious Disease in East African Livestock (IDEAL) project. Some of the calves were found to be genetic hybrids, resulting from the recent introgression of European cattle breed(s) into the indigenous population. European cattle are known to be less well adapted to the infectious diseases present in East Africa. If death and illness as a result of infectious disease have a genetic basis within the population, we would expect both a negative association of these outcomes with introgression and a positive association with heterozygosity. Results: In this indigenous livestock population we observed negative associations between heterozygosity and both death and illness as a result of infectious disease and a positive association between European taurine introgression and episodes of clinical illness. Conclusion: We observe the effects of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression in the East African Shorthorn Zebu, and therefore find evidence of a genetic component to vulnerability to infectious disease. These results indicate that the significant burden of infectious disease in this population could, in principle, be reduced by altered breeding practices.	2013	10.1186/1471-2148-13-246		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Bos	TRUE	TRUE	claimed introgression based off of experimental crosses	TRUE	sequence similarity, heterozygosity	microarray (55000 loci)	TRUE

Mattucci, Federica; Oliveira, Rita; Lyons, Leslie A.; Alves, Paulo C.; Randi, Ettore	European wildcat populations are subdivided into five main biogeographic groups: consequences of Pleistocene climate changes or recent anthropogenic fragmentation?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Extant populations of the European wildcat are fragmented across the continent, the likely consequence of recent extirpations due to habitat loss and over-hunting. However, their underlying phylogeographic history has never been reconstructed. For testing the hypothesis that the European wildcat survived the Ice Age fragmented in Mediterranean refuges, we assayed the genetic variation at 31 microsatellites in 668 presumptive European wildcats sampled in 15 European countries. Moreover, to evaluate the extent of subspecies/population divergence and identify eventual wild 9 domestic cat hybrids, we genotyped 26 African wildcats from Sardinia and North Africa and 294 random-bred domestic cats. Results of multivariate analyses and Bayesian clustering confirmed that the European wild and the domestic cats (plus the African wildcats) belong to two well-differentiated clusters (average P-ST = 0.159, R-ST = 0.392, P > 0.001; Analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA]). We identified from c. 5% to 10% cryptic hybrids in southern and central European populations. In contrast, wild-living cats in Hungary and Scotland showed deep signatures of genetic admixture and introgression with domestic cats. The European wildcats are subdivided into five main genetic clusters (average Phi(ST) = 0.103, R-ST = 0.143, P > 0.001; AMOVA) corresponding to five biogeographic groups, respectively, distributed in the Iberian Peninsula, central Europe, central Germany, Italian Peninsula and the island of Sicily, and in north-eastern Italy and northern Balkan regions (Dinaric Alps). Approximate Bayesian Computation simulations supported late Pleistocene-early Holocene population splittings (from c. 60 k to 10 k years ago), contemporary to the last Ice Age climatic changes. These results provide evidences for wildcat Mediterranean refuges in southwestern Europe, but the evolution history of eastern wildcat populations remains to be clarified. Historical genetic subdivisions suggest conservation strategies aimed at enhancing gene flow through the restoration of ecological corridors within each biogeographic units. Concomitantly, the risk of hybridization with free-ranging domestic cats along corridor edges should be carefully monitored.	2016	10.1002/ece3.1815		Mammals	Carnivora	Felis	TRUE	FALSE	Used structure and phiST along with levels of heterozygosity	TRUE	sequence similarity, demographic inference, STRUCTURE	microsatellites (31)	TRUE

Here, we provide a detailed spatial and genetic characterization of a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the European rabbit. We examined patterns of allele frequency change for 22 markers located on the autosomes, X-chromosome, Y-chromosome and mtDNA in 1078 individuals sampled across the hybrid zone. While some loci revealed extremely wide clines (w300km) relative to an estimated dispersal of 1.954.22km/generation, others showed abrupt transitions (w approximate to 10km), indicating localized genomic regions of strong selection against introgression. The subset of loci showing steep clines had largely coincident centers and stepped changes in allele frequency that did not co-localize with any physical barrier or ecotone, suggesting that the rabbit hybrid zone is a tension zone. The steepest clines were for X- and Y-chromosome markers. Our results are consistent with previous inference based on DNA sequence variation of individuals sampled in allopatry in suggesting that a large proportion of each genome has escaped the overall barrier to gene flow in the middle of the hybrid zone. These results imply an old history of hybridization and high effective gene flow and anticipate that isolation factors should often localize to small genomic regions.	2013	10.1111/mec.12272		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Oryctolagus	TRUE	TRUE	Fst, LD, and cline analysis 	TRUE	clines, sequence similarity	RFLP (17 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE

Reduced introgression of the Y chromosome between subspecies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the Iberian Peninsula	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The role of the Y chromosome in speciation is unclear. Hybrid zones provide natural arenas for studying speciation, as differential introgression of markers may reveal selection acting against incompatibilities. Two subspecies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) form a hybrid zone in the Iberian Peninsula. Previous work on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y- and X-linked loci revealed the existence of two divergent lineages in the rabbit genome and that these lineages are largely subspecies-specific for mtDNA and two X-linked loci. Here we investigated the geographic distribution of the two Y chromosome lineages by genotyping two diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms in a sample of 353 male rabbits representing both subspecies, and found that Y chromosome lineages are also largely subspecies-specific. We then sequenced three autosomal loci and discovered considerable variation in levels of differentiation at these loci. Finally, we compared estimates of population differentiation between rabbit subspecies at 26 markers and found a surprising bimodal distribution of F-ST values. The vast majority of loci showed little or no differentiation between rabbit subspecies while a few loci, including the SRY gene, showed little or no introgression across the hybrid zone. Estimates of population differentiation for the Y chromosome were surprisingly high given that there is male-biased dispersal in rabbits. Taken together, these data indicate that there is a clear dichotomy in the rabbit genome and that some loci remain highly differentiated despite extensive gene flow following secondary contact.	2008	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03943.x		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Oryctolagus	TRUE	TRUE	just the y chr	TRUE	clines, sequence similarity, trees	RFLP (20 loci), mtDNA (4 loci)	TRUE	
Hird, Sarah; Sullivan, Jack	Assessment of gene flow across a hybrid zone in red-tailed chipmunks (Tamias ruficaudus)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The role of hybridization in animal speciation is controversial and recent research has challenged the long-standing criterion of complete reproductive isolation to attain species status. The speciation-with-gene-flow model posits that the genome is semi-permeable and hybridization may be a phase in the process of divergence. Here, we apply these concepts to a previously identified zone of mtDNA introgression between the two strongly morphologically differentiated subspecies of red-tailed chipmunk (Tamias ruficaudus) in the US Inland Northwest. Using multilocus genotype data from the southern, older contact zone, we demonstrate that neutral gene flow is unusually low between the subspecies across the Lochsa River. This is geographically congruent with the discontinuity in bacular morphology, indicating that the cline of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes is displaced. Furthermore, we elucidate the evolutionary forces responsible by testing hypotheses of lineage sorting and hybridization. We determined that introgressive hybridization is the cause of mtDNA/morphology incongruence because there are non-zero levels of migration and gene flow. Although our estimate of the age of the hybrid zone has wide credibility intervals, the hybridization events occurred in the Late Pleistocene and the divergence occurred in the Middle Pleistocene. Finally, we assessed substructure within and adjacent to the hybrid zone and found that the hybrid zone constitutes a set of populations that are genetically differentiated from parental sets of populations; therefore, hybridization in this system is not likely an evolutionary sink, but has generated novel combinations of genotypes.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04196.x		Mammals	Rodentia	Neotamias	TRUE	TRUE	expieremental crosses	TRUE	trees, sequence similarirty, STRUCTURE, NewHybrids, demographic inference	microsatellites (10 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE	
Wilson, Paul J.; Rutledge, Linda Y.; Wheeldon, Tyler J.; Patterson, Brent R.; White, Bradley N.	Y-chromosome evidence supports widespread signatures of three-species Canis hybridization in eastern North America	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	There has been considerable discussion on the origin of the red wolf and eastern wolf and their evolution independent of the gray wolf. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and a Y-chromosome intron sequence in combination with Y-chromosome microsatellites from wolves and coyotes within the range of extensive wolf-coyote hybridization, that is, eastern North America. The detection of divergent Y-chromosome haplotypes in the historic range of the eastern wolf is concordant with earlier mtDNA findings, and the absence of these haplotypes in western coyotes supports the existence of the North American evolved eastern wolf (Canis lycaon). Having haplotypes observed exclusively in eastern North America as a result of insufficient sampling in the historic range of the coyote or that these lineages subsequently went extinct in western geographies is unlikely given that eastern-specific mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplotypes represent lineages divergent from those observed in extant western coyotes. By combining Y-chromosome and mtDNA distributional patterns, we identified hybrid genomes of eastern wolf, coyote, gray wolf, and potentially dog origin in Canis populations of central and eastern North America. The natural contemporary eastern Canis populations represent an important example of widespread introgression resulting in hybrid genomes across the original C. lycaon range that appears to be facilitated by the eastern wolf acting as a conduit for hybridization. Applying conventional taxonomic nomenclature and species-based conservation initiatives, particularly in human-modified landscapes, may be counterproductive to the effective management of these hybrids and fails to consider their evolutionary potential.	2012	10.1002/ece3.301		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	TRUE	microsetellite and Y chr haplotype analysis 	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	microsatellites (4 loci), mtDNA (4 loci)	TRUE

Reid, Noah; Demboski, John R.; Sullivan, Jack	Phylogeny Estimation of the Radiation of Western North American Chipmunks (Tamias) in the Face of Introgression Using Reproductive Protein Genes	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	The causes and consequences of rapid radiations are major unresolved issues in evolutionary biology. This is in part because phylogeny estimation is confounded by processes such as stochastic lineage sorting and hybridization. Because these processes are expected to be heterogeneous across the genome, comparison among marker classes may provide a means of disentangling these elements. Here we use introns from nuclear-encoded reproductive protein genes expected to be resistant to introgression to estimate the phylogeny of the western chipmunks (Tamias: subgenus: Neotamias), a rapid radiation that has experienced introgressive hybridization of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We analyze the nuclear loci using coalescent-based species-tree estimation methods and concatenation to estimate a species tree and we use parametric bootstraps and coalescent simulations to differentiate between phylogenetic error, coalescent stochasticity and introgressive hybridization. Results indicate that the mtDNA gene tree reflects several introgression events that have occurred between taxa of varying levels of divergence and at different time points in the tree. T panamintinus and T. speciosus appear to be fixed for ancient mitochondria] introgressions from T. minimus. A southern Rocky Mountains clade appears well sorted (i.e., species are largely monophyletic) at multiple nuclear loci, while five of six taxa are nonmonophyletic based on cytochrome b. Our simulations reject phylogenetic error and coalescent stochasticity as causes. The results represent an advance in our understanding of the processes at work during the radiation of Tamias and suggest that sampling reproductive-protein genes may be a viable strategy for phylogeny estimation of rapid radiations in which reproductive isolation is incomplete. However, a genome-scale survey that can statistically compare heterogeneity of genealogical process at many more loci will be necessary to test this conclusion.	2012	10.1093/sysbio/syr094		Mammals	Rodentia	Tamias	TRUE	TRUE	haplotype and species tree analysis 	TRUE	trees	microsatellites (4 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE

Bianco, E.; Soto, H. W.; Vargas, L.; Perez-Enciso, M.	The chimerical genome of Isla del Coco feral pigs (Costa Rica), an isolated population since 1793 but with remarkable levels of diversity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The history of domestic species and of their wild ancestors is not a simple one, and feral processes can clarify key aspects of this history, including the adaptive processes triggered by new environments. Here, we provide a comprehensive genomic study of Isla del Coco (Costa Rica) feral pigs, a unique population that was allegedly founded by two individuals and has remained isolated since 1793. Using SNP arrays and genome sequencing, we show that Cocos pigs are hybrids between Asian and European pigs, as are modern international pig breeds. This conclusively shows that, as early as the 18th century, British vessels were loading crossbred pigs in Great Britain and transporting them overseas. We find that the Y chromosome has Asian origin, which has not been reported in any international pig breed. Chinese haplotypes seem to have been transmitted independently between Cocos and other pig breeds, suggesting independent introgression events and a complex pattern of admixing. Although data are compatible with a founder population of N=2, variability levels are as high in Cocos pigs as in international pig breeds (similar to 1.9SNPs/kb) and higher than in European wild boars or local breeds (similar to 1.7SNPs/kb). Nevertheless, we also report a 10-Mb region with a marked decrease in variability across all samples that contains four genes (CPE, H3F3C, SC4MOL and KHL2) previously identified as highly differentiated between wild and domestic pigs. This work therefore illustrates how feral population genomic studies can help to resolve the history of domestic species and associated admixture events.	2015	10.1111/mec.13182		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	Uses population structure and IBD probability for ROH	TRUE	haplotypes and ROH by IBD		FALSE	
Good, Jeffrey M.; Hird, Sarah; Reid, Noah; Demboski, John R.; Steppan, Scott J.; Martin-Nims, Tina R.; Sullivan, Jack	Ancient hybridization and mitochondrial capture between two species of chipmunks	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Models that posit speciation in the face of gene flow are replacing classical views that hybridization is rare between animal species. We use a multilocus approach to examine the history of hybridization and gene flow between two species of chipmunks (Tamias ruficaudus and T. amoenus). Previous studies have shown that these species occupy different ecological niches and have distinct genital bone morphologies, yet appear to be incompletely isolated reproductively in multiple areas of sympatry. We compared data from four sequenced nuclear loci and from seven microsatellite loci to published cytochrome b sequences. Interspecific gene flow was primarily restricted to introgression of the T. ruficaudus mitochondrial genome into a sympatric subspecies of T. amoenus, T. a. canicaudus, with the four sequenced nuclear loci showing little to no interspecific allele sharing. Microsatellite data were consistent with high levels of differentiation between the species and also showed no current gene flow between broadly sympatric populations of T. a. canicaudus and T. ruficaudus. Coalescent analyses date the mtDNA introgression event from the mid-Pleistocene to late Pliocene. Overall, these data indicate that introgression has had a minimal impact on the nuclear genomes of T. amoenus and T. ruficaudus despite multiple independent hybridization events. Our findings challenge long-standing assumptions on patterns of reproductive isolation in chipmunks and suggest that there may be other examples of hybridization among the 23 species of Tamias that occur in western North America.	2008	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03640.x		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	just mtDNA and not the D stats	TRUE	HKA test, STRUCTURE, and divergence tests		FALSE	
Miller, J. M.; Poissant, J.; Hogg, J. T.; Coltman, D. W.	Genomic consequences of genetic rescue in an insular population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Genetic rescue is a management intervention whereby a small population is supplemented with individuals from other populations in an attempt to reverse the effects of inbreeding and increased genetic load. One such rescue was recently documented in the population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) within the National Bison Range wildlife refuge (Montana, USA). Here, we examine the locus-specific effects of rescue in this population using a newly developed genome-wide set of 195 microsatellite loci and first-generation linkage map. We found that the rate of introgression varied among loci and that 111 loci, 57% of those examined, deviated from patterns of neutral inheritance. The most common deviation was an excess of homozygous genotypes relative to neutral expectations, indicative of directional selection. As in previous study of this rescue, individuals with more introduced alleles had higher reproductive success and longevity. In addition, we found 30 loci, distributed throughout the genome, which seem to have individual effects on these life history traits. Although the potential for outbreeding depression is a major concern when translocating individuals between populations, we found no evidence of such effects in this population.	2012	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05427.x		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Ovis	TRUE	TRUE	hybrid index and genomic cline analysis 	TRUE	INTROGRESS, heterozygosity	microsattleite (195 markers)	TRUE

Elledge, Amanda E.; Leung, Luke K. -P.; Allen, Lee R.; Firestone, Karen; Wilton, Alan N.	Assessing the taxonomic status of dingoes Canis familiaris dingo for conservation	MAMMAL REVIEW	1. The conservation status of the dingo Canis familiaris dingo is threatened by hybridization with the domestic dog C. familiaris familiaris. A practical method that can estimate the different levels of hybridization in the field is urgently required so that animals below a specific threshold of dingo ancestry (e.g. 1/4 or 1/2 dingoes) can reliably be identified and removed from dingo populations. 2. Skull morphology has been traditionally used to assess dingo purity, but this method does not discriminate between the different levels of dingo ancestry in hybrids. Furthermore, measurements can only be reliably taken from the skulls of dead animals. 3. Methods based on the analysis of variation in DNA are able to discriminate between the different levels of hybridization, but the validity of this method has been questioned because the materials currently used as a reference for dingoes are from captive animals of unproven genetic purity. The use of pre-European materials would improve the accuracy of this method, but suitable material has not been found in sufficient quantity to develop a reliable reference population. Furthermore, current methods based on DNA are impractical for the field-based discrimination of hybrids because samples require laboratory analysis. 4. Coat colour has also been used to estimate the extent of hybridization and is possibly the most practical method to apply in the field. However, this method may not be as powerful as genetic or morphological analyses because some hybrids (e.g. Australian cattle dog x dingo) are similar to dingoes in coat colour and body form. This problem may be alleviated by using additional visual characteristics such as the presence/absence of ticking and white markings.	2006	10.1111/j.1365-2907.2006.00086.x		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	morphology	morphology	TRUE	
Thulin, Carl-Gustaf; Fang, Meiying; Averianov, Alexander O.	Introgression from Lepus europaeus to L-timidus in Russia revealed by mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms and nuclear microsatellites	HEREDITAS	Hybridisation among wild mammal populations may lead to introgression of genes and genomes over the species barrier. In Sweden, in northern Europe, and on the Iberian Peninsula in southern Europe, mitochondrial DNA from L. timidus occurs among L. europaeus specimens, presumably as a result of interspecific hybridisation. In Russia, the species are believed to hybridise as well, but no investigations have confirmed introgression. Here we develop species diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mitochondrial genomes and combine them with analysis of nuclear microsatellite markers to investigate hybridisation and introgression in 71 Lepus specimens from Russia. A total of 58 specimens are typical representatives of either species. An additional nine specimens have slightly intermediate genotypes, potentially as a result of introgression of nuclear genes. Finally, we find three specimens with L. europaeus mitochondrial genome and apparent L. timidus nuclear genome. This indicates that the reciprocal transfer of mtDNA occur among Russian populations of these species. Our observation differs from previous observations of mtDNA introgression in Sweden and Iberia, and provides further support for a reticulated mode of introgression within the genus Lepus.	2006	10.1111/j.2006.0018-0661.01952.x		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Lepus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity	microsattelite (7 loci), mtDNA (1 locus)	TRUE

Arnold, Michael L.; Meyer, Axel	Natural hybridization in primates: One evolutionary mechanism	ZOOLOGY	The role and importance of natural hybridization in the evolutionary histories of animal taxa is still debated. This results largely from a history of zoological investigations that assumed, rather than documented, a limited evolutionary role for this process. However, it is now becoming apparent that, just as for plants, the creative effects of reticulate evolution are widespread in animal taxa as well. This conclusion is supported by the documentation of numerous instances of the formation of new taxa and the genetic enrichment through introgressive hybridization. In the present review, we use primates as a paradigm for how natural hybridization can affect the evolution of species complexes and remains a footprint on genomes. Findings for a number of groups, including basal (e.g. lemurs) and derived (e.g. Old World apes) lineages, demonstrate that introgression and hybrid speciation have caused a reticulate pattern that is still detectable in the, often mosaic, genomes of primates. For example, results from genetic analyses of our own species demonstrate the process of past introgressive hybridization with the progenitors of our sister taxa (i.e. chimpanzees and gorillas) and most likely also our extinct, close relatives in the hominid lineage.

Berry, RJ; Scriven, PN	The house mouse: a model and motor for evolutionary understanding	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Commensal house mice have spread from their probable origin in north India, differentiating into a number of forms described variously as species, semispecies or subspecies. The different taxa can breed together and exchange genes but they retain their distinctiveness (although Mus (musculus) molossinus of Japan seems to be the result of a complete fusion between M. (m.) musculus and M. (m.) castaneus). The most widespread form is M. (M.) domesticus, which has successfully colonized every continent as a commensal, albeit with varying contributions from other Mus genomes. It has also been domesticated as the laboratory mouse. This means that the same genome is exposed to a wide variety of environments and gives tremendous opportunities for exploring the operation of different evolutionary mechanisms. Mice have accompanied evolutionary understanding from early Darwinian days - confirming Mendelian ratios and showing they applied in mammals, providing data on rates of evolution, and representing examples of dominance modification, differential survival, competition and other indicators of a struggle for existence. However, they have an unfulfilled potential to drive as well as to illuminate evolutionary theory - by revealing more about, for example, the interactions between gene flow and social determinants, constraints on introgression and physiological adjustments. This potential can be explored through our ever-deepening knowledge of the genome and molecular mechanisms, and by the application of new techniques, but its most effective agent will always be the cross-disciplinary synergy of visionary scientists like Julian Huxley, Charles Elton and Louis Thaler.

White, Michael A.; Ane, Cecile; Dewey, Colin N.; Larget, Bret R.; Payseur, Bret A.	Fine-Scale Phylogenetic Discordance across the House Mouse Genome	PLOS GENETICS	Population genetic theory predicts discordance in the true phylogeny of different genomic regions when studying recently diverged species. Despite this expectation, genome-wide discordance in young species groups has rarely been statistically quantified. The house mouse subspecies group provides a model system for examining phylogenetic discordance. House mouse subspecies are recently derived, suggesting that even if there has been a simple tree-like population history, gene trees could disagree with the population history due to incomplete lineage sorting. Subspecies of house mice also hybridize in nature, raising the possibility that recent introgression might lead to additional phylogenetic discordance. Single-locus approaches have revealed support for conflicting topologies, resulting in a subspecies tree often summarized as a polytomy. To analyze phylogenetic histories on a genomic scale, we applied a recently developed method, Bayesian concordance analysis, to dense SNP data from three closely related subspecies of house mice: Mus musculus musculus, M. m. castaneus, and M. m. domesticus. We documented substantial variation in phylogenetic history across the genome. Although each of the three possible topologies was strongly supported by a large number of loci, there was statistical evidence for a primary phylogenetic history in which M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus are sister subspecies. These results underscore the importance of measuring phylogenetic discordance in other recently diverged groups using methods such as Bayesian concordance analysis, which are designed for this purpose.	2009	10.1371/journal.pgen.1000729		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	just phylogenetics	TRUE	trees	microarray (4355000 loci)	TRUE

The biogeography of introgression in the critically endangered African monkey Rungwecebus kipunji	BIOLOGY LETTERS	In the four years since its original description, the taxonomy of the kipunji (Rungwecebus kipunji), a geographically restricted and critically endangered African monkey, has been the subject of much debate, and recent research suggesting that the first voucher specimen of Rungwecebus has baboon mitochondrial DNA has intensified the controversy. We show that Rungwecebus from a second region of Tanzania has a distinct mitochondrial haplotype that is basal to a clade containing all Papio species and the original Rungwecebus voucher, supporting the placement of Rungwecebus as the sister taxon of Papio and its status as a separate genus. We suggest that the Rungwecebus population in the Southern Highlands has experienced geographically localized mitochondrial DNA introgression from Papio, while the Ndundulu population retains the true Rungwecebus mitochondrial genome.	2010	10.1098/rsbl.2009.0741		Mammals	Primates	Rungwecebus	TRUE	TRUE	just on mtDNA	TRUE	trees	mtDNA (4 genes)	TRUE

New World cattle show ancestry from multiple independent domestication events	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Previous archeological and genetic research has shown that modern cattle breeds are descended from multiple independent domestication events of the wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) similar to 10,000 y ago. Two primary areas of domestication in the Middle East/Europe and the Indian subcontinent resulted in taurine and indicine lines of cattle, respectively. American descendants of cattle brought by European explorers to the New World beginning in 1493 generally have been considered to belong to the taurine lineage. Our analyses of 47,506 single nucleotide polymorphisms show that these New World cattle breeds, as well as many related breeds of cattle in southern Europe, actually exhibit ancestry from both the taurine and indicine lineages. In this study, we show that, although European cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage, gene flow from African cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern European cattle breeds and their New World descendants. New World cattle breeds, such as Texas Longhorns, provide an opportunity to study global population structure and domestication in cattle. Following their introduction into the Americas in the late 1400s, semiferal herds of cattle underwent between 80 and 200 generations of predominantly natural selection, as opposed to the human-mediated artificial selection of Old World breeding programs. Our analyses of global cattle breed population history show that the hybrid ancestry of New World breeds contributed genetic variation that likely facilitated the adaptation of these breeds to a novel environment.	2013	10.1073/pnas.1303367110		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Bos	TRUE	TRUE	just STRUCTURE	TRUE	PCA, STRUCTURE, trees	microarray (1800 loci)	TRUE

Verardi, A.; Lucchini, V.; Randi, E.	Detecting introgressive hybridization between free-ranging domestic dogs and wild wolves (Canis lupus) by admixture linkage disequilibrium analysis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Occasional crossbreeding between free-ranging domestic dogs and wild wolves (Canis lupus) has been detected in some European countries by mitochondrial DNA sequencing and genotyping unlinked microsatellite loci. Maternal and unlinked genomic markers, however, might underestimate the extent of introgressive hybridization, and their impacts on the preservation of wild wolf gene pools. In this study, we genotyped 220 presumed Italian wolves, 85 dogs and 7 known hybrids at 16 microsatellites belonging to four different linkage groups (plus four unlinked microsatellites). Population clustering and individual assignments were performed using a Bayesian procedure implemented in structure 2.1, which models the gametic disequilibrium arising between linked loci during admixtures, aiming to trace hybridization events further back in time and infer the population of origin of chromosomal blocks. Results indicate that (i) linkage disequilibrium was higher in wolves than in dogs; (ii) 11 out of 220 wolves (5.0%) were likely admixed, a proportion that is significantly higher than one admixed genotype in 107 wolves found previously in a study using unlinked markers; (iii) posterior maximum-likelihood estimates of the recombination parameter r revealed that introgression in Italian wolves is not recent, but could have continued for the last 70 (+/- 20) generations, corresponding to approximately 140-210 years. Bayesian clustering showed that, despite some admixture, wolf and dog gene pools remain sharply distinct (the average proportions of membership to wolf and dog clusters were Q(w) = 0.95 and Q(d) = 0.98, respectively), suggesting that hybridization was not frequent, and that introgression in nature is counteracted by behavioural or selective constraints.	2006	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.02995.x		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (16 loci)	TRUE

Payseur, Bret A.; Place, Michael	Searching the genomes of inbred mouse strains for incompatibilities that reproductively isolate their wild relatives	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	Identification of the genes that underlie reproductive isolation provides important insights into the process of speciation. According to the Dobzhansky-Muller model, these genes suffer disrupted interactions in hybrids due to independent divergence in separate populations. In hybrid populations, natural selection acts to remove the deleterious heterospecific combinations that cause these functional disruptions. When selection is strong, this process can maintain multilocus associations, primarily between conspecific alleles, providing a signature that can be used to locate incompatibilities. We applied this logic to populations of house mice that were formed by hybridization involving two species that show partial reproductive isolation, Mus domesticus and Mus musculus. Using molecular markers likely to be informative about species ancestry, we scanned the genomes of 1) classical inbred strains and 2) recombinant inbred lines for pairs of loci that showed extreme linkage disequilibria. By using the same set of markers, we identified a list of locus pairs that displayed similar patterns in both scans. These genomic regions may contain genes that contribute to reproductive isolation between M. domesticus and M. musculus. This hypothesis can now be tested using laboratory crosses and surveys of introgression in the wild.	2007	10.1093/jhered/esl064		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	expiermental crosses	TRUE	sequence similarity, LD	Sanger (256 loci)	TRUE	
Hindrikson, Maris; Maennil, Peep; Ozolins, Janis; Krzywinski, Andrzej; Saarma, Urmas	Bucking the Trend in Wolf-Dog Hybridization: First Evidence from Europe of Hybridization between Female Dogs and Male Wolves	PLOS ONE	Studies on hybridization have proved critical for understanding key evolutionary processes such as speciation and adaptation. However, from the perspective of conservation, hybridization poses a concern, as it can threaten the integrity and fitness of many wild species, including canids. As a result of habitat fragmentation and extensive hunting pressure, gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations have declined dramatically in Europe and elsewhere during recent centuries. Small and fragmented populations have persisted, but often only in the presence of large numbers of dogs, which increase the potential for hybridization and introgression to deleteriously affect wolf populations. Here, we demonstrate hybridization between wolf and dog populations in Estonia and Latvia, and the role of both genders in the hybridization process, using combined analysis of maternal, paternal and biparental genetic markers. Eight animals exhibiting unusual external characteristics for wolves - six from Estonia and two from Latvia - proved to be wolf-dog hybrids. However, one of the hybridization events was extraordinary. Previous field observations and genetic studies have indicated that mating between wolves and dogs is sexually asymmetrical, occurring predominantly between female wolves and male dogs. While this was also the case among the Estonian hybrids, our data revealed the existence of dog mitochondrial genomes in the Latvian hybrids and, together with Y chromosome and autosomal microsatellite data, thus provided the first evidence from Europe of mating between male wolves and female dogs. We discuss patterns of sexual asymmetry in wolf-dog hybridization.	2012	10.1371/journal.pone.0046465		Mammals	Carnivora	Canis	TRUE	TRUE	microsatellites, mtDNA, Fst, and STRUCTURE	TRUE	PCA, STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (11 loci)	TRUE

Natural and Anthropogenic Hybridization in Two Species of Eastern Brazilian Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus and C. penicillata)	PLOS ONE	Animal hybridization is well documented, but evolutionary outcomes and conservation priorities often differ for natural and anthropogenic hybrids. Among primates, an order with many endangered species, the two contexts can be hard to disentangle from one another, which carries important conservation implications. Callithrix marmosets give us a unique glimpse of genetic hybridization effects under distinct natural and human-induced contexts. Here, we use a 44 autosomal microsatellite marker panel to examine genome-wide admixture levels and introgression at a natural C. jacchus and C. penicillata species border along the Sao Francisco River in NE Brazil and in an area of Rio de Janeiro state where humans introduced these species exotically. Additionally, we describe for the first time autosomal genetic diversity in wild C. penicillata and expand previous C. jacchus genetic data. We characterize admixture within the natural zone as bimodal where hybrid ancestry is biased toward one parental species or the other. We also show evidence that Sao Francisco River islands are gateways for bidirectional gene flow across the species border. In the anthropogenic zone, marmosets essentially form a hybrid swarm with intermediate levels of admixture, likely from the absence of strong physical barriers to interspecific breeding. Our data show that while hybridization can occur naturally, the presence of physical, even if leaky, barriers to hybridization is important for maintaining species genetic integrity. Thus, we suggest further study of hybridization under different contexts to set well informed conservation guidelines for hybrid populations that often fit somewhere between "natural" and "man-made."	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0127268		Mammals	Primates	Callithrix	TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (44 loci)	TRUE

Genome-wide patterns of gene flow across a house mouse hybrid zone	GENOME RESEARCH	Hybrid zones between closely related species or Subspecies provide useful settings for Studying the genetic architecture of speciation. Using markers distributed throughout the mouse genome, we use a hybrid Zone between two recently diverged species Of house mice (Mus musculus and Mus domesticus) as a natural mapping experiment to identify genomic regions that may be involved in reproductive isolation. Using cline analysis we document a nearly SO-fold variation in level of introgression among markers. Some markers have extremely narrow cline widths; these genomic regions may contribute to reproductive isolation. Biological processes associated with these narrow clines include physiological and immune responses to the environment as well as physiological and behavioral aspects of reproduction. Other autosomal markers exhibit asymmetrically broad clines, usually with high frequencies of M. domesticus alleles on the M. musculus side of the hybrid zone. These markers identify genome regions likely housing genes with alleles that are spreading from one species to the other. Biological processes associated with these wide clines include cell signaling, olfaction, and pheromone response. These processes play important roles in survival and reproduction, and associated genes are likely targets of selection. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the center of the hybrid zone Suggest that isolation may be caused by multiple epistatic interactions between sets of genes. These data highlight the complex genetic architecture underlying speciation even at early stages of divergence and point to some of the biological processes that may govern this architecture.	2008	10.1101/gr.6757907		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	clines, LD, PANTHER	microsattelite (39)	TRUE	
Berthier, Pierre; Excoffier, Laurent; Ruedi, Manuel	Recurrent replacement of mtDNA and cryptic hybridization between two sibling bat species Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	The two sibling bat species Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii occur in sympatry over wide areas of Southern and Central Europe. Morphological, ecological and previous genetic evidence supported the view that the two species constitute two well-differentiated groups, but recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the two species share some mtDNA haplotypes when they occur in sympatry. In order to see whether some genetic exchange has occurred between the two species, we sequenced a highly variable segment of the mitochondrial control region in both species living in sympatry and in allopatry. We also analysed the nuclear diversity of 160 individuals of both species found in two mixed nursery colonies located north and south of the Alps. MtDNA analysis confirmed that European M. blythii share multiple, identical or very similar haplotypes with M. myotis. Since allopatric Asian M. blythii presents mtDNA sequences that are very divergent from those of the two species found in Europe, we postulate that the mitochondrial genome of the European M. blythii has been replaced by that of M. myotis. The analysis of nuclear diversity shows a strikingly different pattern, as both species are well differentiated within mixed nursery colonies (F-ST = 0.18). However, a Bayesian analysis of admixture reveals that the hybrids can be frequently observed, as about 25% of sampled M. blythii show introgressed genes of M. myotis origin. In contrast, less than 4% of the M. myotis analysed were classified as non-parental genotypes, revealing an asymmetry in the pattern of hybridization between the two species. These results show that the two species can interbreed and that the hybridization is still ongoing in the areas of sympatry. The persistence of well-differentiated nuclear gene pools, in spite of an apparent replacement of mitochondrial genome in European M. blythii by that of M. myotis, is best explained by a series of introgression events having occurred repeatedly during the recent colonization of Europe by M. blythii from Asia. The sharp contrast obtained from the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers further points to the need to cautiously interpret results based on a single class of genetic markers.	2006	10.1098/rspb.2006.3680		Mammals	Chiroptera	Myotis	TRUE	TRUE	just mtDNA and not the D stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, NewHybrids	Sanger (1 locus), microsattelites (5 loci)	TRUE

The genomic legacy from the extinct Lepus timidus to the three hare species of Iberia: contrast between mtDNA, sex chromosomes and autosomes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Extensive interspecific genetic introgression is often reported, and appraising its genomic impact can serve to determine whether it results from selection on specific loci or from demographic processes affecting the whole genome. The three species of hares present in the Iberian Peninsula harbour high frequencies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Lepus timidus, an arctic/boreal species now extinct in the region. This could result from the invasive replacement of L. timidus by the temperate species during deglaciation but should then have left traces in the nuclear genome. We typed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered by sequencing 10 autosomal loci, two X-linked and one Y-linked in species-wide samples of the four taxa. Based on lineage-diagnostic SNPs, we detected no trace of L. timidus sex chromosomes in Iberia. From the frequencies of inferred haplotypes, autosomal introgression into L. granatensis appeared mostly sporadic but always widespread instead of restricted to the north as mtDNA. Autosomal introgression into Iberian L. europaeus, inhabiting the Pyrenean foothills, was hardly detectable, despite quasi-fixation of L. timidus mtDNA. L. castroviejoi, endemic to the Cantabrian Mountains and fixed for L. timidus mtDNA, showed little traces of autosomal introgression. The absence of sex-chromosome introgression presumably resulted from X-linked hybrid male unfitness. The contrasting patterns between the autosomes and mtDNA could reflect general gender asymmetric processes such as frequency-dependent female assortative mating, lower mtDNA migration and higher male dispersal, but adaptive mtDNA introgression cannot be dismissed. Additionally, we document reciprocal introgression between L. europaeus and both L. granatensis in Iberia and L. timidus outside Iberia.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04221.x		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Lepus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, PCA, STRUCTURE	Sanger (10 loci)	TRUE	
Hassanin, A.; Ropiquet, A.	What is the taxonomic status of the Cambodian banteng and does it have close genetic links with the kouprey?	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY	In a recent paper, Galbreath, Mordacq & Weiler (2006) concluded that the kouprey Bos sauveli was not a natural species, but rather a feral animal derived from hybridization between banteng Bos javanicus and zebu Bos taurus indicus. Here, we analyze two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and subunit II of the cytochrome c oxidase) for all the seven species of the subtribe Bovina, including new sequences for several specimens of banteng, zebu and gaur of Cambodia. Our analyses indicate that mitochondrial sequences of Cambodian banteng are divergent from those of Javan banteng (mean difference = 4.27%), but similar to those of kouprey (1.25%). We propose two conflicting hypotheses to interpret these results: (1) the Cambodian and Indonesian banteng belong to two distinct species, and the kouprey derived from Cambodian banteng; (2) all subspecies of banteng belong to Bo. javanicus, but the mitochondrial genome of kouprey was transferred by natural hybridization into the ancestor of Cambodian banteng. Morphological, ecological and ethological characteristics of banteng and kouprey rather support the second hypothesis. However, we need to sequence nuclear markers, and to analyze banteng from Lao, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, to give a definitive conclusion on the taxonomic status of banteng and kouprey.	2007	10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00272.x		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Bos	TRUE	TRUE	just mtDNA and not the D stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE

Mouse (Mus musculus) is a good model for this purpose. Here we present the analysis of genealogies of the 21 nuclear loci and one mitochondrial DNA region in M. musculus based on our nucleotide sequences of nine inbred strains from three M. musculus subspecies (musculus, domesticus, and castaneus) and one M. spicilegus strain as an outgroup. The mitochondrial DNA gene genealogy of those strains confirmed the introgression pattern of one musculus strain. V hen all the nuclear DNA data were concatenated to produce a phylogenetic tree of nine strains, musculus and domesticus strains formed monophyletic clusters with each other, while the two castaneus strains were paraphyletic. When each DNA region was treated independently, the phylogenetic networks revealed an unnegligibly high level of subspecies admixture and the mosaic nature of their genome. Estimation of ancestral and derived population sizes and migration rates suggests the effects of ancestral polymorphism and gene flow on the pattern of genetic variation of the current subspecies. Gene genealogies of Fut4 and Dfy loci also suggested existence of the gene flow between M. musculus and M. spicilegus or other distant species.	2008	10.1266/ggs.83.77		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	trees, demography	Sanger (21 genes)	TRUE	
Boratynski, Zbyszek; Alves, Paulo Celio; Berto, Stefano; Koskela, Esa; Mappes, Tapio; Melo-Ferreira, Jose	Introgression of mitochondrial DNA among Myodes voles: consequences for energetics?	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Introgression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is among the most frequently described cases of reticulate evolution. The tendency of mtDNA to cross interspecific barriers is somewhat counter intuitive considering the key function of enzymes that it encodes in the oxidative-phosphorylation process, which could give rise to hybrid dysfunction. How mtDNA reticulation affects the evolution of metabolic functions is, however, uncertain. Here we investigated how morpho-physiological traits vary in natural populations of a common rodent (the bank vole, Myodes glareolus) and whether this variation could be associated with mtDNA introgression. First, we confirmed that M. glareolus harbour mtDNA introgressed from M. rutilus by analyzing mtDNA (cytochrome b, 954 bp) and nuclear DNA (four markers; 2333 bp in total) sequence variation and reconstructing loci phylogenies among six natural populations in Finland. We then studied geographic variation in body size and basal metabolic rate (BMR) among the populations of M. glareolus and tested its relationship with mtDNA type. Results: Myodes glareolus and its arctic neighbour, M. rutilus, are reciprocally monophyletic at the analyzed nuclear DNA loci. In contrast, the two northernmost populations of M. glareolus have a fixed mitotype that is shared with M. rutilus, likely due to introgressive hybridization. The analyses of phenotypic traits revealed that the body mass and whole-body, but not mass corrected, BMR are significantly reduced in M. glareolus females from northern Finland that also have the introgressed mitotype. Restricting the analysis to the single population where the mitotypes coexist, the association of mtDNA type with whole-body BMR remained but those with mass corrected BMR and body mass did not. Mitochondrial sequence variation in the introgressed haplotypes is compatible with demographic growth of the populations, but may also be a result of positive selection. Conclusion: Our results show that the phenotypic traits vary markedly along the north-south axis of populations of M. glareolus. This variation may be related to adaptation to local environments and coincides with the gradient of genome reticulation between M. glareolus and M. rutilus, which was assessed by mtDNA introgression. Introgression of mtDNA may have affected morpho-physiological traits but do not show strong effects on either body mass or basal metabolic rate alone. We discuss the causes and biological meaning of our results and the means to clarify these questions in future research.	2011	10.1186/1471-2148-11-355		Mammals	Rodentia	Myodes	TRUE	TRUE	phylogentic analysis and HKA test for just mtDNA	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE	
Ropiquet, Anne; Hassanin, Alexandre	Hybrid origin of the Pliocene ancestor of wild goats	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Recent theories on speciation suggest that interspecific hybridization is an important mechanism for explaining adaptive radiation. According to this view, hybridization can promote the rapid transfer of adaptations between different species; the hybrid population thus invades new habitats and diversifies into a variety of new species. Although hybridization is well accepted as a fairly common mechanism for diversification in plants, its role in the evolution of animals is more controversial, because reduced fitness would typically condemn animal hybrids to an evolutionary dead-end. Here, we examine DNA sequences of four mitochondrial and four nuclear genes selected for resolving phylogenetic relationships between goats, sheep, and their allies. Our analyses provide evidence of strong discordance for the position of Capra between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. We suggest that the common ancestor of wild goats arose from interspecific hybridization, and that the mitochondrial genome of a species better adapted to life at high attitudes was transferred via this route into the common ancestor of Capra. We propose that the acquisition of more efficient mitochondria has conferred a selective advantage on goats, allowing their rapid adaptive radiation during the Plio-Pleistocene epoch. Our study therefore agrees with theories that predict an important role for interspecific hybridization in the evolution and diversification of animal species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Hird, Sarah; Reid, Noah; Demboski, John; Sullivan, Jack	Introgression at differentially aged hybrid zones in red-tailed chipmunks	GENETICA	Hybrid zones allow us to investigate the maintenance and the break down of reproductive isolation; they are a window into the speciation process. Tamias ruficaudus (red-tailed chipmunk) has a roughly ring-like distribution in the Inland Northwest and includes two morphologically well-differentiated subspecies, T. r. ruficaudus (in the eastern portion of its range) and T. r. simulans (in the western portion). These taxa meet at two contact zones: the Lochsa River in Idaho and 200 km to the north, near Whitefish, Montana. The Lochsa Zone is encompassed within the Clearwater River Drainage, which has been proposed as a glacial refugium for many taxa throughout the Pleistocene, whereas the Whitefish Zone was under the Cordilleran ice sheet during the most recent glacial maxima approximately 10,000 years ago. Mitochondrial DNA introgression has been documented at both contact zones, yet the subspecies remain significantly distinct with respect to bacular morphology and no intermediate morphologies have ever been reported. Here, we elucidate differentiation and introgression of the nuclear genome using ten microsatellite loci and compare findings to previously described mitochondrial DNA haplotype distribution and introgression. We found significant substructure in the nuclear data; each subspecies is divided into at least two genetically distinct demes. At the Lochsa contact zone, individuals restricted to the mtDNA zone of introgression form a distinct deme at microsatellite loci whereas in the younger, Whitefish contact zone, there is no hybrid-zone specific group. The genetic distances of the demes within these two subspecies indicate recent northward expansion.	2010	10.1007/s10709-010-9470-z		Mammals	Rodentia	Tamias	TRUE	TRUE	just on mtDNA	TRUE	demography, STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites (10 loci)	TRUE	
Harr, Bettina	Genomic islands of differentiation between house mouse subspecies	GENOME RESEARCH	Understanding the genes that contribute to reproductive isolation is essential to understanding speciation, but isolating such genes has proven very difficult. In this study I apply a multilocus test statistic to > 10,000 SNP markers assayed in wild-derived inbred strains of house mice to identify genomic regions of elevated differentiation between two subspecies of house mice, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. Differentiation was high through similar to 90% of the X chromosome. In addition, eight regions of high differentiation were identified on the autosomes, totaling 7.5% of the autosomal genome. Regions of high differentiation were confirmed by direct sequencing of samples collected from the wild. Some regions of elevated differentiation have an overrepresentation of genes with host - pathogen interactions and olfaction. The most strongly differentiated region on the X has previously been shown to fail to introgress across a hybrid zone between the two subspecies. This survey indicates autosomal regions that should also be examined for differential introgression across the hybrid zone, as containing potential genes causing hybrid unfitness.	2006	10.1101/gr.5045006		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	microarray (13000 loci)	TRUE

Good, Jeffrey M.; Dean, Matthew D.; Nachman, Michael W.	A complex genetic basis to X-linked hybrid male sterility between two species of house mice	GENETICS	The X chromosome plays a central role in the evolution of reproductive isolation, but few studies have examined the genetic basic of X-linked incompatibilities during the early stages of speciation. We report the results of a large experiment focused on the reciprocal introgression of the X chromosome between two species of house mice, Mus musculus and M. domesticus. Introgression of the M. Musculus X chromosome into a wild-derived M. domesticus genetic background produced male-limited sterility, qualitatively consistent with previous experiments using classic inbred strains to represent M. domesticus. The genetic basis of sterility involved a minimum of four X-linked factors. The phenotypic effects of major sterility QTL were largely additive and resulted in complete sterility when combined. No sterility factors were uncovered on the M. domesticus X chromosome. Overall, these results revealed a complex and asymmetric genetic basis to X-linked hybrid male sterility during the early stages of speciation in mice. Combined with data from previous studies, we identify one relatively narrow interval on the M. musculus X chromosome involved in hybrid male sterility. Only a handful of spermatogenic genes are within this region, including one of the most rapidly evolving genes on the mouse X chromosome.	2008	10.1534/genetics.107.085340		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	expieremental crosses	FALSE	lab introgression		TRUE

Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis reveals recent genetic introgression from domestic pigs into Northwest European wild boar populations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Present-day genetic introgression from domestic pigs into European wild boar has been suggested in various studies. However, no hybrids have been identified beyond doubt mainly because available methods were unable to quantify the extent of introgression and rule out natural processes. Genetic introgression from domestic pigs may have far-reaching ecological consequences by altering traits like the reproduction rate or immunology of wild boar. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to investigate genetic introgression in a Northwest (NW) European wild boar data set using a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay developed for domestic pigs. We quantified the extent of introgression using allele frequency spectrum analysis, in silico hybridization simulations and genome distribution patterns of introgressed SNPs. Levels of recent introgression in the study area were expected to be low, as pig farming practices are prevailingly intensive and indoors. However, evidence was found for geographically widespread presence of domestic pig SNPs in 10% of analysed wild boar. This was supported by the identification of two different pig mitochondrial DNA haplotypes in three of the identified hybrid wild boar, suggesting that introgression had occurred from multiple sources (pig breeds). In silico hybridization simulations showed that the level of introgression in the identified hybrid wild boar is equivalent to first-generation hybrids until fifth-generation backcrosses with wild boar. The distribution pattern of introgressed SNPs supported these assignments in four of nine hybrids. The other five hybrids are considered advanced-generation hybrids, resulting from interbreeding among hybrid individuals. Three of nine hybrids were genetically associated with a different wild boar population than the one in which they were sampled. This discrepancy suggests that genetic introgression has occurred through the escape or release of an already hybridized farmed wild boar stock. We conclude that genetic introgression from domestic pigs into NW European wild boar populations is more recent and more common than expected and that genome-wide SNP analysis is a promising tool to quantify recent hybridization in free-living populations.	2013	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05670.x		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Sus	TRUE	TRUE	rare SNP and haplotype analysis	TRUE	sequence similarity, PCA, STRUCTURE	microarray (45720 loci)	TRUE

Rogers, Rebekah L.	Chromosomal Rearrangements as Barriers to Genetic Homogenization between Archaic and Modern Humans	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Chromosomal rearrangements, which shuffle DNA throughout the genome, are an important source of divergence across taxa. Using a paired-end read approach with Illumina sequence data for archaic humans, I identify changes in genome structure that occurred recently in human evolution. Hundreds of rearrangements indicate genomic trafficking between the sex chromosomes and autosomes, raising the possibility of sex-specific changes. Additionally, genes adjacent to genome structure changes in Neanderthals are associated with testis-specific expression, consistent with evolutionary theory that new genes commonly form with expression in the testes. I identify one case of new-gene creation through transposition from the Y chromosome to chromosome 10 that combines the 50-end of the testis-specific gene Fank1 with previously untranscribed sequence. This new transcript experienced copy number expansion in archaic genomes, indicating rapid genomic change. Among rearrangements identified in Neanderthals, 13% are transposition of selfish genetic elements, whereas 32% appear to be ectopic exchange between repeats. In Denisovan, the pattern is similar but numbers are significantly higher with 18% of rearrangements reflecting transposition and 40% ectopic exchange between distantly related repeats. There is an excess of divergent rearrangements relative to polymorphism in Denisovan, which might result from nonuniform rates of mutation, possibly reflecting a burst of transposable element activity in the lineage that led to Denisovan. Finally, loci containing genome structure changes show diminished rates of introgression from Neanderthals into modern humans, consistent with the hypothesis that rearrangements serve as barriers to gene flow during hybridization. Together, these results suggest that this previously unidentified source of genomic variation has important biological consequences in human evolution.	2015	10.1093/molbev/msv204		Mammals	Primates	Homo	TRUE	FALSE	calculated introgression probability from sigma values 	TRUE	sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE

Alda, Fernando; Doadrio, Ignacio	Spatial genetic structure across a hybrid zone between European rabbit subspecies	PEERJ	The Iberian Peninsula is the only region in the world where the two existing subspecies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) naturally occur and hybridize. In this study we explore the relative roles of historical and contemporary processes in shaping the spatial genetic structure of the rabbit across its native distribution range, and how they differently affect each subspecies and the hybrid zone. For that purpose we obtained multilocus genotypes and mitochondrial DNA data from 771 rabbits across most of the distribution range of the European rabbit in Spain. Based on the nuclear markers we observed a hierarchical genetic structure firstly comprised by two genetic groups, largely congruent with the mitochondrial lineages and subspecies distributions (O. c. algirus and O. c. cuniculus), which were subsequently subdivided into seven genetic groups. Geographic distance alone emerged as an important factor explaining genetic differentiation across the whole range, without the need to invoke for the effect for geographical barriers. Additionally, the significantly positive spatial correlation up to a distance of only 100 km supported the idea that differentiation at a local level is of greater importance when considering the species overall genetic structure. When looking at the subspecies, northern populations of O. c. cuniculus showed more spatial genetic structure and differentiation than O. c. algirus. This could be due to local geographic barriers, limited resources, soil type and/or social behavior limiting dispersal. The hybrid zone showed similar genetic structure to the southern populations but a larger introgression from the northern lineage genome. These differences have been attributed to selection against the hybrids rather than to behavioral differences between subspecies. Ultimately, the genetic structure of the rabbit in its native distribution range is the result of an ensemble of factors, from geographical and ecological, to behavioral and molecular, that hierarchically interact through time and space.	2014	10.7717/peerj.582		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Oryctolagus	TRUE	TRUE	LOL used structure and Fst	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelites (10 loci)	TRUE

Reintroductions and genetic introgression from domestic pigs have shaped the genetic population structure of Northwest European wild boar	BMC GENETICS	Background: Population genetic studies focus on natural dispersal and isolation by landscape barriers as the main drivers of genetic population structure. However, anthropogenic factors such as reintroductions, translocations and wild x domestic hybridization may also have strong effects on genetic population structure. In this study we genotyped 351 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers evenly spread across the genome in 645 wild boar (Sus scrofa) from Northwest Europe to evaluate determinants of genetic population structure. Results: We show that wild boar genetic population structure is influenced by historical reintroductions and by genetic introgression from domestic pigs. Six genetically distinct and geographically coherent wild boar clusters were identified in the Netherlands and Western Germany. The Dutch Veluwe cluster is known to be reintroduced, and three adjacent Dutch and German clusters are suspected to be a result of reintroduction, based on clustering results, low levels of heterozygosity and relatively high genetic distances to nearby populations. Recent wild x domestic hybrids were found geographically widespread across clusters and at low frequencies (average 3.9%). The relationship between pairwise kinship coefficients and geographic distance showed male-biased dispersal at the population genetic level. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that wildlife and landscape management by humans are shaping the genetic diversity of an iconic wildlife species. Historical reintroductions, translocation and recent restocking activities with farmed wild boar have all influenced wild boar genetic population structure. The current trend of wild boar population growth and range expansion has recently led to a number of contact zones between clusters, and further admixture between the different wild boar clusters is to be expected.	2013	10.1186/1471-2156-14-43		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Sus	TRUE	TRUE	STRUCTURE, Fst, and phylogentic analysis 	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees	microarray (384 loci)	TRUE

Sacks, Benjamin N.; Moore, Marcelle; Statham, Mark J.; Wittmer, Heiko U.	A restricted hybrid zone between native and introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations suggests reproductive barriers and competitive exclusion	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Introduced species can threaten native taxa in multiple ways, including competition and hybridization, which can reduce fitness, alter ecological niches or swamp native genomes. Encroachment and hybridization by introduced species also provide opportunities to study the dynamics of invasiveness and hybridization during early stages following contact. We used 33 microsatellites, 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms and a mtDNA marker to characterize the extent and spatial pattern of encroachment and hybridization between a native, endemic subspecies of red fox (Vulpes vulpes patwin) and an introduced red fox population composed of highly admixed, phylogenetically divergent stock, resulting from a century of domestication. Both nuclear and mtDNA markers indicated that hybridization was primarily restricted to a narrow zone where the two populations came into contact. Although a few introgressed genotypes were detected in the interior of the native range, we found no immigrant foxes or F-1 or F-2 hybrids there, suggesting native foxes excluded introduced individuals. We speculate that the observed interbreeding at the periphery was facilitated by low densities. In total, 98% of mtDNA haplotypes in the native range were native and 96% of the nuclear ancestry was estimated to be native. Although the introduced range had expanded fivefold over the past four decades, native and non-native haplotypes from museum samples collected in and near the native range three decades earlier showed a similar geographic distribution as today, suggesting that the native range and hybrid zone were relatively stable. We hypothesize that the monogamous mating system of red foxes and other wild canids may enhance their resistance to hybridization because of greater fitness consequences associated with mate discrimination.	2011	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04943.x		Mammals	Carnivora	Vulpes	TRUE	TRUE	just tested for gene flow not introigression explicitly 	TRUE	clines, demography	Sanger (1 gene), microsattelite (51 loci)	TRUE

Hybrid origin of European commercial pigs examined by an in-depth haplotype analysis on chromosome 1	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS	Although all farm animals have an original source of domestication, a large variety of modern breeds exist that are phenotypically highly distinct from the ancestral wild population. This phenomenon can be the result of artificial selection or gene flow from other sources into the domesticated population. The Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) has been domesticated at least twice in two geographically distinct regions during the Neolithic revolution when hunting shifted to farming. Prior to the establishment of the commercial European pig breeds we know today, some 200 years ago Chinese pigs were imported into Europe to improve local European pigs. Commercial European domesticated pigs are genetically more diverse than European wild boars, although historically the latter represents the source population for domestication. In this study we examine the cause of the higher diversity within the genomes of European commercial pigs compared to their wild ancestors by testing two different hypotheses. In the first hypothesis we consider that European commercial pigs are a mix of different European wild populations as a result of movement throughout Europe, hereby acquiring haplotypes from all over the European continent. As an alternative hypothesis, we examine whether the introgression of Asian haplotypes into European breeds during the Industrial Revolution caused the observed increase in diversity. By using re-sequence data for chromosome 1 of 136 pigs and wild boars, we show that an Asian introgression of about 20% into the genome of European commercial pigs explains the majority of the increase in genetic diversity. These findings confirm that the Asian hybridization, that was used to improve production traits of local breeds, left its signature in the genome of the commercial pigs we know today.	2015	10.3389/fgene.2014.00442		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Sus	TRUE	TRUE	used simulations and haplotype analysis 	TRUE	sequence similarity, demography	WGS	TRUE	
Janousek, Vaclav; Munclinger, Pavel; Wang, Liuyang; Teeter, Katherine C.; Tucker, Priscilla K.	Functional Organization of the Genome May Shape the Species Boundary in the House Mouse	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Genomic features such as rate of recombination and differentiation have been suggested to play a role in species divergence. However, the relationship of these phenomena to functional organization of the genome in the context of reproductive isolation remains unexplored. Here, we examine genomic characteristics of the species boundaries between two house mouse subspecies (Mus musculus musculus/M. m. domesticus). These taxa form a narrow semipermeable zone of secondary contact across Central Europe. Due to the incomplete nature of reproductive isolation, gene flow in the zone varies across the genome. We present an analysis of genomic differentiation, rate of recombination, and functional composition of genes relative to varying amounts of introgression. We assessed introgression using 1,316 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers, previously genotyped in hybrid populations from three transects. We found a significant relationship between amounts of introgression and both genomic differentiation and rate of recombination with genomic regions of reduced introgression associated with higher genomic differentiation and lower rates of recombination, and the opposite for genomic regions of extensive introgression. We also found a striking functional polarization of genes based on where they are expressed in the cell. Regions of elevated introgression exhibit a disproportionate number of genes involved in signal transduction functioning at the cell periphery, among which olfactory receptor genes were found to be the most prominent group. Conversely, genes expressed intracellularly and involved in DNA binding were the most prevalent in regions of reduced introgression. We hypothesize that functional organization of the genome is an important driver of species divergence.	2015	10.1093/molbev/msv011		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	TRUE	clines	microarray (1316 loci)	TRUE

Untangling the hybrid nature of modern pig genomes: a mosaic derived from biogeographically distinct and highly divergent Sus scrofa populations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The merging of populations after an extended period of isolation and divergence is a common phenomenon, in natural settings as well as due to human interference. Individuals with such hybrid origins contain genomes that essentially form a mosaic of different histories and demographies. Pigs are an excellent model species to study hybridization because European and Asian wild boars diverged similar to 1.2 Mya, and pigs were domesticated independently in Europe and Asia. During the Industrial Revolution in England, pigs were imported from China to improve the local pigs. This study utilizes the latest genomics tools to identify the origin of haplotypes in European domesticated pigs that are descendant from Asian and European populations. Our results reveal fine-scale haplotype structure representing different ancient demographic events, as well as a mosaic composition of those distinct histories due to recently introgressed haplotypes in the pig genome. As a consequence, nucleotide diversity in the genome of European domesticated pigs is higher when at least one haplotype of Asian origin is present, and haplotype length correlates negatively with recombination frequency and nucleotide diversity. Another consequence is that the inference of past effective population size is influenced by the background of the haplotypes in an individual, but we demonstrate that by careful sorting based on the origin of haplotypes, both distinct demographic histories can be reconstructed. Future detailed mapping of the genomic distribution of variation will enable a targeted approach to increase genetic diversity of captive and wild populations, thus facilitating conservation efforts in the near future.	2014	10.1111/mec.12807		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Sus	TRUE	TRUE	Used IBD segements, Fst, PSMC, and STRUCTURE	TRUE	sequence similarity, demography, STRUCTURE	WGS (2377000 loci)	TRUE

However, hybridization and subsequent gene flow must be relatively common in order to localize individual loci that resist introgression. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to study genome-wide patterns of genetic differentiation between two hybridizing subspecies of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus and O. c. cuniculus) that are known to undergo high rates of gene exchange. Our primary objective was to identify specific genes or genomic regions that have resisted introgression and are likely to confer reproductive barriers in natural conditions. On the basis of 326,000 polymorphisms, we found low to moderate overall levels of differentiation between subspecies, and fewer than 200 genomic regions dispersed throughout the genome showing high differentiation consistent with a signature of reduced gene flow. Most differentiated regions were smaller than 200 Kb and contained very few genes. Remarkably, 30 regions were each found to contain a single gene, facilitating the identification of candidate genes underlying reproductive isolation. This gene-level resolution yielded several insights into the genetic basis and architecture of reproductive isolation in rabbits. Regions of high differentiation were enriched on the X-chromosome and near centromeres. Genes lying within differentiated regions were often associated with transcription and epigenetic activities, including chromatin organization, regulation of transcription, and DNA binding. Overall, our results from a naturally hybridizing system share important commonalities with hybrid incompatibility genes identified using laboratory crosses in mice and flies, highlighting general mechanisms underlying the maintenance of reproductive barriers.	2014	10.1371/journal.pgen.1003519		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Oryctolagus	TRUE	TRUE	just looked at different statitics of population differentation 	TRUE	sequence similarity	transcriptome (149000 loci), WGS (177000 loci)	TRUE	
Geraldes, Armando; Ferrand, Nuno; Nachman, Michael W.	Contrasting patterns of introgression at X-linked loci across the hybrid zone between subspecies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)	GENETICS	Hybrid zones provide an excellent opportunity for studying the consequences of genetic changes between closely related taxa. Here we investigate patterns of genetic variability and gene flow at four X-linked loci within and between the two subspecies of European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus and O. c. algirus). Two of these genes are located near the centromere and two are located near the telomeres. We observed a deep split in the genealogy of each gene with the root located along the deepest branch in each case, consistent with the evolution of these subspecies in allopatry. The two centromeric loci showed low levels of variability, high levels of linkage disequilibrium, and little introgression between subspecies. In contrast, the two telomeric loci showed high levels of variability, low levels of linkage disequilibrium, and considerable introgression between subspecies. These data are consistent with suppression of recombination near the centromere of the rabbit X chromosome. These observations support a view of speciation where genomic incompatibilities at different loci in the genome create localized differences in levels of gene flow between nascent species.	2006	10.1534/genetics.105.054106		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Oryctolagus	TRUE	TRUE	just sex chrs and no stats of interest 	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (4 loci)	TRUE

SPECIATION IN THE EUROPEAN RABBIT (ORYCTOLAGUS CUNICULUS): ISLANDS OF DIFFERENTIATION ON THE X CHROMOSOME AND AUTOSOMES	EVOLUTION	Studies of gene flow between closely related taxa can provide insight into the genetic basis of speciation. To evaluate the importance of the X chromosome in reproductive isolation between subspecies of the European rabbit and to study the genomic scale over which islands of differentiation extend, we resequenced a total of 34 loci distributed along the X chromosome and chromosome 14. Previous studies based on few markers suggested that loci in centromeric regions were highly differentiated between rabbit subspecies, whereas loci in telomeric regions were less differentiated. Here, we confirmed this finding but also discovered remarkable variation in levels of differentiation among loci, with F-ST values from nearly 0 to 1. Analyses using isolation-with-migration models suggest that this range appears to be largely explained by differential levels of gene flow among loci. The X chromosome was significantly more differentiated than the autosomes. On chromosome 14, differentiation decayed very rapidly at increasing distances from the centromere, but on the X chromosome distinct islands of differentiation encompassing several megabases were observed both at the centromeric region and along the chromosome arms. These findings support the idea that the X chromosome plays an important role in reproductive isolation between rabbit subspecies. These results also demonstrate the mosaic nature of the genome at species boundaries.	2010	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01092.x		Mammals	Lagomorpha	Oryctolagus	TRUE	TRUE	looked at patterns of variation vs neutral simulations	TRUE	demography, sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (34 loci)	TRUE	
Good, Jeffrey M.; Vanderpool, Dan; Keeble, Sara; Bi, Ke	Negligible nuclear introgression despite complete mitochondrial capture between two species of chipmunks	EVOLUTION	The idea that species boundaries can be semipermeable to gene flow is now widely accepted but the evolutionary importance of introgressive hybridization remains unclear. Here we examine the genomic contribution of gene flow between two hybridizing chipmunk species, Tamias ruficaudus and T. amoenus. Previous studies have shown that ancient hybridization has resulted in complete fixation of introgressed T. ruficaudus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in some populations of T. amoenus, but the extent of nuclear introgression is not known. We used targeted capture to sequence over 10,500 gene regions from multiple individuals of both species. We found that most of the nuclear genome is sorted between these species and that overall genealogical patterns do not show evidence for introgression. Our analysis rules out all but very minor levels of interspecific gene flow, indicating that introgressive hybridization has had little impact on the overall genetic composition of these species outside of the mitochondrial genome. Given that much of the evidence for introgression in animals has come from mtDNA, our results underscore that unraveling the importance introgressive hybridization during animal speciation will require a genome-wide perspective that is still absent for many species.	2015	10.1111/evo.12712		Mammals	Rodentia	Tamias	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	WGS	TRUE

We inferred the population genetic structure of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in Poland from mitochondrial (CR and cyt b) and sex-linked markers (ZFX, SRY, DBY4 and DBY8). Analyses of CR mtDNA sequences from 452 individuals indicated widespread introgression of Siberian roe deer (C.pygargus) mtDNA in the European roe deer genome, 2000km from the current distribution range of C.pygargus. Introgressed individuals constituted 16.6% of the deer studied. Nearly 75% of them possessed haplotypes belonging to the group which arose 23kyr ago and have not been detected within the natural range of Siberian roe deer, indicating that majority of present introgression has ancient origin. Unlike the mtDNA results, sex-specific markers did not show signs of introgression. Species distribution modelling analyses suggested that C.pygargus could have extended its range as far west as Central Europe after last glacial maximum. The main hybridization event was probably associated with range expansion of the most abundant European roe deer lineage from western refugia and took place in Central Europe after the Younger Dryas (10.8-10.0ka BP). Initially, introgressed mtDNA variants could have spread out on the wave of expansion through the mechanism of gene surfing, reaching high frequencies in European roe deer populations and leading to observed asymmetrical gene flow. Human-mediated introductions of C.pygargus had minimal effect on the extent of mtDNA introgression.	2014	10.1111/mec.12745		Mammals	Artiodactyla	Capreolus	TRUE	TRUE	just mtDNA and not the D stats	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (5 genes)	TRUE	
Phifer-Rixey, Megan; Nachman, Michael W.	Insights into mammalian biology from the wild house mouse Mus musculus	ELIFE	The house mouse, Mus musculus, was established in the early 1900s as one of the first genetic model organisms owing to its short generation time, comparatively large litters, ease of husbandry, and visible phenotypic variants. For these reasons and because they are mammals, house mice are well suited to serve as models for human phenotypes and disease. House mice in the wild consist of at least three distinct subspecies and harbor extensive genetic and phenotypic variation both within and between these subspecies. Wild mice have been used to study a wide range of biological processes, including immunity, cancer, male sterility, adaptive evolution, and non-Mendelian inheritance. Despite the extensive variation that exists among wild mice, classical laboratory strains are derived from a limited set of founders and thus contain only a small subset of this variation. Continued efforts to study wild house mice and to create new inbred strains from wild populations have the potential to strengthen house mice as a model system.	2015	10.7554/eLife.05959		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	review of the model organism	FALSE	cites other work		TRUE	
Kass, David H.; Janousek, Vaclav; Wang, Liuyang; Tucker, Priscilla K.	The uncharacterized gene 1700093K21Rik and flanking regions are correlated with reproductive isolation in the house mouse, Mus musculus	MAMMALIAN GENOME	Reproductive barriers exist between the house mouse subspecies, Mus musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus, members of the Mus musculus species complex, primarily as a result of hybrid male infertility, and a hybrid zone exists where their ranges intersect in Europe. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) diagnostic for the two taxa, the extent of introgression across the genome was previously compared in these hybrid populations. Sixty-nine of 1316 autosomal SNPs exhibited reduced introgression in two hybrid zone transects suggesting maladaptive interactions among certain loci. One of these markers is within a region on chromosome 11 that, in other studies, has been associated with hybrid male sterility of these subspecies. We assessed sequence variation in a 20 Mb region on chromosome 11 flanking this marker, and observed its inclusion within a roughly 150 kb stretch of DNA showing elevated sequence differentiation between the two subspecies. Four genes are associated with this genomic subregion, with two entirely encompassed. One of the two genes, the uncharacterized 1700093K21Rik gene, displays distinguishing features consistent with a potential role in reproductive isolation between these subspecies. Along with its expression specifically within spermatogenic cells, we present various sequence analyses that demonstrate a high rate of molecular evolution of this gene, as well as identify a subspecies amino acid variant resulting in a structural difference. Taken together, the data suggest a role for this gene in reproductive isolation.	2014	10.1007/s00335-014-9506-2		Mammals	Rodentia	Mus	TRUE	TRUE	So confused they looked at RI, hybrid index, and citing various other studies	FALSE	cites other work		TRUE	
Currat, Mathias; Excoffier, Laurent	Strong reproductive isolation between humans and Neanderthals inferred from observed patterns of introgression	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Recent studies have revealed that 2-3% of the genome of non-Africans might come from Neanderthals, suggesting a more complex scenario of modern human evolution than previously anticipated. In this paper, we use a model of admixture during a spatial expansion to study the hybridization of Neanderthals with modern humans during their spread out of Africa. We find that observed low levels of Neanderthal ancestry in Eurasians are compatible with a very low rate of interbreeding (<2%), potentially attributable to a very strong avoidance of interspecific matings, a low fitness of hybrids, or both. These results suggesting the presence of very effective barriers to gene flow between the two species are robust to uncertainties about the exact demography of the Paleolithic populations, and they are also found to be compatible with the observed lack of mtDNA introgression. Our model additionally suggests that similarly low levels of introgression in Europe and Asia may result from distinct admixture events having occurred beyond the Middle East, after the split of Europeans and Asians. This hypothesis could be tested because it predicts that different components of Neanderthal ancestry should be present in Europeans and in Asians.	2011	10.1073/pnas.1107450108		Mammals	Primates	Homo	TRUE	TRUE	demographic study that just cited introgression did not calculate it 	FALSE	cites other work		TRUE

J.; Falush, Daniel	Progressive genome-wide introgression in agricultural Campylobacter coli	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybridization between distantly related organisms can facilitate rapid adaptation to novel environments, but is potentially constrained by epistatic fitness interactions among cell components. The zoonotic pathogens Campylobacter coli and C. jejuni differ from each other by around 15% at the nucleotide level, corresponding to an average of nearly 40 amino acids per protein-coding gene. Using whole genome sequencing, we show that a single C. coli lineage, which has successfully colonized an agricultural niche, has been progressively accumulating C. jejuni DNA. Members of this lineage belong to two groups, the ST-828 and ST-1150 clonal complexes. The ST-1150 complex is less frequently isolated and has undergone a substantially greater amount of introgression leading to replacement of up to 23% of the C. coli core genome as well as import of novel DNA. By contrast, the more commonly isolated ST-828 complex bacteria have 1011% introgressed DNA, and C. jejuni and nonagricultural C. coli lineages each have <2%. Thus, the C. coli that colonize agriculture, and consequently cause most human disease, have hybrid origin, but this cross-species exchange has so far not had a substantial impact on the gene pools of either C. jejuni or nonagricultural C. coli. These findings also indicate remarkable interchangeability of basic cellular machinery after a prolonged period of independent evolution.	2013	10.1111/mec.12162		Bacteria	Campylobacterales	Campylobacter	TRUE	TRUE	no stats	TRUE	trees, demography, sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE

A clonal strain of the parasite, first found in the United Kingdom, has become the predominant strain there and spread to continental Europe. Discriminating this epidemic strain of T. gallinae from other strains necessitated development of multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Development of the MLST was facilitated by the assembly and annotation of a 54.7 Mb draft genome of a cloned stabilate of the A1 European finch epidemic strain (isolated from Greenfinch, Chloris chloris, XT-1081/07 in 2007) containing 21,924 protein coding genes. This enabled construction of a robust 19 locus MLST based on existing typing loci for Trichomonas vaginalis and T. gallinae. Our MLST has the sensitivity to discriminate strains within existing genotypes confidently, and resolves the American finch A1 genotype from the European finch epidemic A1 genotype. Interestingly, one isolate we obtained from a captive black-naped fruit dove Ptilinopsus melanospilus, was not truly T. gallinae but a hybrid of T. gallinae with a distant trichomonad lineage. Phylogenetic analysis of the individual loci in this fruit dove provides evidence of gene flow between distant trichomonad lineages at 2 of the 19 loci examined and may provide precedence for the emergence of other hybrid trichomonad genomes including T. vaginalis.	2019	10.1093/gbe/evz164		Metamonada	Trichomonadida	Trichomonas	TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Genome-wide sequence information reveals recurrent hybridization among diploid wheat wild relatives	PLANT JOURNAL	Many conflicting hypotheses regarding the relationships among crops and wild species closely related to wheat (the genera Aegilops, Amblyopyrum, and Triticum) have been postulated. The contribution of hybridization to the evolution of these taxa is intensely discussed. To determine possible causes for this, and provide a phylogeny of the diploid taxa based on genome-wide sequence information, independent data were obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing and a target-enrichment experiment that returned 244 low-copy nuclear loci. The data were analyzed using Bayesian, likelihood and coalescent-based methods. D statistics were used to test if incomplete lineage sorting alone or together with hybridization is the source for incongruent gene trees. Here we present the phylogeny of all diploid species of the wheat wild relatives. We hypothesize that most of the wheat-group species were shaped by a primordial homoploid hybrid speciation event involving the ancestral Triticum and Am. muticum lineages to form all other species except Ae. speltoides. This hybridization event was followed by multiple introgressions affecting all taxa except Triticum. Mostly progenitors of the extant species were involved in these processes, while recent interspecific gene flow seems insignificant. The composite nature of many genomes of wheat-group taxa results in complicated patterns of diploid contributions when these lineages are involved in polyploid formation, which is, for example, the case for tetraploid and hexaploid wheats. Our analysis provides phylogenetic relationships and a testable hypothesis for the genome compositions in the basic evolutionary units within the wheat group of Triticeae.		10.1111/tpj.14641		Plants	Poales	Aegilops, Ambylopyrum, Triticum	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	Patterson's D, Dfoil, trees	GBS (140000 loci)	TRUE

Mondon, Ana; Owens, Gregory L.; Poverene, Monica; Cantamutto, Miguel; Rieseberg, Loren H.	Gene flow in Argentinian sunflowers as revealed by genotyping-by-sequencing data	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Gene flow can have several different applied consequences, ranging from extinction to the escape of transgenes to the evolution of weedy or invasive lineages. Here, we describe patterns of hybridization and gene flow involving domesticated and wild sunflowers in Argentina. To address the risks of introgression of variants from the cultivated sunflower into invasive wild Helianthus, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to genotype 182 samples from 11 sites in Argentina, along with previously published data from samples from the native range (North America), to determine the native source populations of the Argentinian samples and to detect admixture. We unexpectedly discovered two distinctive forms of H. petiolaris in Argentina, one from H. petiolaris subsp. petiolaris as expected, but the other from an unknown source. Extensive admixture was observed among Argentinian sunflowers, largely confirming phenotypic predictions. While many hybrids are F1s, there were signals consistent with introgression from the domesticated sunflower into H. petiolaris. Whether this introgression is incidental or a causal driver of invasiveness is not yet clear, but it seems likely that genes found in the domesticated sunflower genome (whether engineered or not) will quickly find their way into wild Argentinian sunflower populations.	2018	10.1111/eva.12527		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	fastSTructure, sequence similarity, Patterson's D	GBS	TRUE

Niissalo, Matti A.; Leong-Skornickova, Jana; Webb, Edward L.; Khew, Gillian S.	Pedigree analyses and next-generation sequencing reveal critically low regeneration in extremely threatened Zingiber singapurense (Zingiberaceae)	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Molecular tools are crucial in the conservation management of small populations, but they have rarely been used for conservation of threatened plants, especially in the Tropics. Next-generation sequencing allows realistic access to detailed measurements of genetic diversity even in the rarest species. We used 12 170 genomic markers to investigate dynamics in the total population of Zingiber singapurense, one of the rarest well-surveyed herbs in South-East Asia. The markers were used to estimate the population size and to identify pedigrees in the population and introgression with closely related species. This diploid species is strongly clonal with only 13 genetically distinct individuals. The clones included only one probable sibling pair and no observed parent-offspring pairs except for a single hybrid, but the inferred effective population size was 150 individuals. The surviving individuals are ancient relicts without any evidence of recent reproduction. Clonal reproduction, great age and lack of sexual reproduction have protected the species from inbreeding, which is surprising for a small, superficially delicate herb. Similar situations may explain the observed survival of many species in small populations in Singapore. The best conservation interventions are discussed, but more information is needed on the factors that limit reproduction in this species.	2018	10.1093/botlinnean/boy018		Plants	Zingiberales	Zingiber	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	fastSTRUCTURE, Patterson's D	RAD (7428 loci)	TRUE	
Osborne, Owen G.; Chapman, Mark A.; Nevado, Bruno; Filatov, Dmitry A.	Maintenance of Species Boundaries Despite Ongoing Gene Flow in Ragworts	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The role of hybridization between diversifying species has been the focus of a huge amount of recent evolutionary research. While gene flow can prevent speciation or initiate species collapse, it can also generate new hybrid species. Similarly, while adaptive divergence can be wiped out by gene flow, new adaptive variation can be introduced via introgression. The relative frequency of these outcomes, and indeed the frequency of hybridization and introgression in general are largely unknown. One group of closely related species with several documented cases of hybridization is the Mediterranean ragwort (genus: Senecio) species-complex. Examples of both polyploid and homoploid hybrid speciation are known in the clade, although their evolutionary relationships and the general frequency of introgressive hybridization among them remain unknown. Using a whole genome gene space dataset comprising eight Senecio species we fully resolve the phylogeny of these species for the first time despite phylogenetic incongruence across the genome. Using a D-statistic approach, we demonstrate previously unknown cases of introgressive hybridization between multiple pairs of taxa across the species tree. This is an important step in establishing these species as a study system for diversification with gene flow, and suggests that introgressive hybridization may be a widespread and important process in plant evolution.	2016	10.1093/gbe/evw053		Plants	Asterales	Senecio	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	trees, Patterson's D	transcriptome	TRUE	
Owens, Gregory L.; Baute, Gregory J.; Rieseberg, Loren H.	Revisiting a classic case of introgression: hybridization and gene flow in Californian sunflowers	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	During invasion, colonizing species can hybridize with native species, potentially swamping out native genomes. However, theory predicts that introgression will often be biased into the invading species. Thus, empirical estimates of gene flow between native and invasive species are important to quantify the actual threat of hybridization with invasive species. One classic example of introgression occurs in California, where Helianthus bolanderi was thought to be a hybrid between the serpentine endemic Helianthus exilis and the congeneric invader Helianthus annuus. We used genotyping by sequencing to look for signals of introgression and population structure. We find that H. bolanderi and H. exilis form one genetic clade, with weak population structure that is associated with geographic location rather than soil composition and likely represent a single species, not two. Additionally, while our results confirmed early molecular analysis and failed to support the hybrid origin of H. bolanderi, we did find evidence for introgression mainly into the invader H. annuus, as predicted by theory.	2016	10.1111/mec.13569		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	ADMIXTURE, splistree, Patterson's D	GBS	TRUE

Intraspecific genetic divergence within Helianthus niveus and the status of two new morphotypes from Mexico	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise Collecting and characterizing the genetic diversity of wild relatives of crops can contribute importantly to sustainable crop production and food security. Wild sunflower, Helianthus niveus, occurs in arid regions in western North America and is partially cross-compatible with the cultivated sunflower (H. annuus). We assessed phylogenetic relationships and patterns of genetic divergence among three previously described subspecies (subsp. niveus, subsp. canescens, and subsp. tephrodes) as well as two new morphotypes of H. niveus recently discovered in extreme drought and dune habitats in Baja California, Mexico. Methods We measured 50 plants growing in a common garden for 27 morphological traits and conducted principal component analysis to assess patterns of phenotypic variation. Genome size of each accession was determined using flow cytometry. Pollen viability of first generation hybrids between taxa was tested to infer the strength of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive barriers. Finally, genotyping-by-sequencing data were used to investigate the genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships among the previously described subspecies and new morphotypes. Results The intraspecific genetic and phenotypic divergence of H. niveus populations closely tracks their geographical distribution. Subspecies niveus is phenotypically, genetically, and reproductively distinct from the other two subspecies and has a larger genome. Therefore, H. niveus as currently circumscribed should be considered to contain two distinct species, H. niveus and H. tephrodes. ABBA-BABA tests revealed substantial introgression between subsp. canescens and its sympatric congener H. petiolaris, which might contribute to their morphological similarities. The two new morphotypes collected in Mexico represent local ecotypes of subsp. niveus that occur in extreme drought and dune environments. Mantel tests showed a strong positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances. Conclusions We conclude that geographic isolation is primarily responsible for intraspecific genomic divergence within H. niveus, while patterns of phenotypic variation appear to have been shaped by ecological selection and interspecific introgression.	2019	10.1002/ajb2.1349		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	ADMIXTURE, sequence similarity, Patterson's D	GBS	TRUE

Equally unclear is the origin of the only American butternut, J. cinerea. We resequenced the whole genome of 80 individuals from 19 of the 22 species of Juglans and assembled the genome of its relatives Pterocarya stenoptera and Platycarya strobilacea. Using phylogenetic-network analysis of single-copy nuclear genes, genome-wide site pattern probabilities, and Approximate Bayesian Computation, we discovered that J. regia (and its landrace J. sigillata) arose as a hybrid between the American and the Asian lineages and that J. cinerea resulted from massive introgression from an immigrating Asian butternut into the genome of an American black walnut. Approximate Bayesian Computation modeling placed the hybrid origin in the late Pliocene, similar to 3.45 My, with both parental lineages since having gone extinct in Europe.	2019	10.1093/molbev/msz112		Plants	Fagales	Juglans	TRUE	FALSE		TRUE	STRUCTURE, Hyde, Patterson's D	WGS	TRUE

Christe, Camille; Stolting, Kai N.; Bresadola, Luisa; Fussi, Barbara; Heinze, Berthold; Wegmann, Daniel; Lexer, Christian	Selection against recombinant hybrids maintains reproductive isolation in hybridizing Populus species despite F-1 fertility and recurrent gene flow	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Natural hybrid zones have proven to be precious tools for understanding the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation (RI) and therefore species. Most available genomic studies of hybrid zones using whole-or partial-genome resequencing approaches have focused on comparisons of the parental source populations involved in genome admixture, rather than exploring fine-scale patterns of chromosomal ancestry across the full admixture gradient present between hybridizing species. We have studied three well-known European 'replicate' hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two widespread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432 505 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of fine-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F-1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a significant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent F-1 fertility, consistent with the intragenomic 'coadaptation' model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole-genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of specific genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown.	2016	10.1111/mec.13587		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	stats inaccessible	TRUE	HMM, sequence similarity	RAD (432000 loci)	TRUE

These crops were derived via several thousands of years of human selection that transformed wild ancestors into high-yielding domesticated descendants. Among cultivated plants, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important grain legume. Yet, our understanding of the origins and concurrent shaping of the genome of this crop plant is limited. Results: We sequenced the genomes of 29 accessions representing 12 Phaseolus species. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenomic analyses, using both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, allowed us to detect a speciation event, a finding further supported by metabolite profiling. In addition, we identified similar to 1200 protein coding genes (PCGs) and similar to 100 long non-coding RNAs with domestication-associated haplotypes. Finally, we describe asymmetric introgression events occurring among common bean subpopulations in Mesoamerica and across hemispheres. Conclusions: We uncover an unpredicted speciation event in the tropical Andes that gave rise to a sibling species, formerly considered the "wild ancestor" of P. vulgaris, which diverged before the split of the Mesoamerican and Andean P. vulgaris gene pools. Further, we identify haplotypes strongly associated with genes underlying the emergence of domestication traits. Our findings also reveal the capacity of a predominantly autogamous plant to outcross and fix loci from different populations, even from distant species, which led to the acquisition by domesticated beans of adaptive traits from wild relatives. The occurrence of such adaptive introgressions should be exploited to accelerate breeding programs in the near future.	2017	10.1186/s13059-017-1190-6		Plants	Fabales	Phaseolus	TRUE	TRUE	stats inaccessible	TRUE	trees, fD	WGS (17600000 loci)	TRUE

In this study, we generated two populations of rice F-1 hybrids with present-day commercial hybrid parents, genotyped the parents with 50k SNP chip and genome resequencing, and recorded the phenotype of similar to 2,000 hybrids at three field trials. By integrating these data with the collected genotypes of similar to 4,200 rice landraces and improved varieties that were reported previously, we found that the male and female parents have different levels of genome introgressions from other rice subpopulations, including indica, aus, and japonica, therefore shaping heterotic loci in the hybrids. Among the introgressed exogenous genome, we found that heterotic loci, including Ghd8/DTH8, Gn1a, and IPA1 existed inwild rice, but were significantly divergently selected among the rice subpopulations, suggesting these loci were subject to environmental adaptation. During modern rice hybrid breeding, heterotic loci were further selected by removing loci with negative effect and fixing loci with positive effect and pyramid breeding. Our results provide insight into the genetic basis underlying the heterosis of elite hybrid rice varieties, which could facilitate a better understanding of heterosis and rice hybrid breeding.	2020	10.1073/pnas.1919086117		Plants	Poales	Oryza	TRUE	TRUE	stats inaccessible	TRUE	fD, Patterson's D	microarray	TRUE

Hamlin, Jennafer A. P.; Hibbins, Mark S.; Moyle, Leonie C.	Assessing biological factors affecting postspeciation introgression	EVOLUTION LETTERS	An increasing number of phylogenomic studies have documented a clear "footprint" of postspeciation introgression among closely related species. Nonetheless, systematic genome-wide studies of factors that determine the likelihood of introgression remain rare. Here, we propose an a priori hypothesis-testing framework that uses introgression statistics-including a new metric of estimated introgression, D-p-to evaluate general patterns of introgression prevalence and direction across multiple closely related species. We demonstrate this approach using whole genome sequences from 32 lineages in 11 wild tomato species to assess the effect of three factors on introgression-genetic relatedness, geographical proximity, and mating system differences-based on multiple trios within the "ABBA-BABA" test. Our analyses suggest each factor affects the prevalence of introgression, although our power to detect these is limited by the number of comparisons currently available. We find that of 14 species pairs with geographically "proximate" versus "distant" population comparisons, 13 showed evidence of introgression; in 10 of these cases, this was more prevalent between geographically closer populations. We also find modest evidence that introgression declines with increasing genetic divergence between lineages, is more prevalent between lineages that share the same mating system, and-when it does occur between mating systems-tends to involve gene flow from more inbreeding to more outbreeding lineages. Although our analysis indicates that recent postspeciation introgression is frequent in this group-detected in 15 of 17 tested trios-estimated levels of genetic exchange are modest (0.2-2.5% of the genome), so the relative importance of hybridization in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of these species could be limited. Regardless, similar clade-wide analyses of genomic introgression would be valuable for disentangling the major ecological, reproductive, and historical determinants of postspeciation gene flow, and for assessing the relative contribution of introgression as a source of genetic variation.		10.1002/evl3.159		Plants	Solanales	Solanum	TRUE	TRUE	stats inaccessible	TRUE	D, Dp, D2	WGS	TRUE

Suarez-Gonzalez, Adriana; Hefer, Charles A.; Christe, Camille; Corea, Oliver; Lexer, Christian; Cronk, Quentin C. B.; Douglas, Carl J.	Genomic and functional approaches reveal a case of adaptive introgression from Populus balsamifera (balsam poplar) in P. trichocarpa (black cottonwood)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Natural hybrid zones in forest trees provide systems to study the transfer of adaptive genetic variation by introgression. Previous landscape genomic studies in Populus trichocarpa, a keystone tree species, indicated genomic footprints of admixture with its sister species Populus balsamifera and identified candidate genes for local adaptation. Here, we explored the patterns of introgression and signals of local adaptation in P. trichocarpa and P. balsamifera, employing genome resequencing data from three chromosomes in pure species and admixed individuals from wild populations. Local ancestry analysis in admixed P. trichocarpa revealed a telomeric region in chromosome 15 with P. balsamifera ancestry, containing several candidate genes for local adaptation. Genomic analyses revealed signals of selection in certain genes in this region (e.g. PRR5, COMT1), and functional analyses based on gene expression variation and correlations with adaptive phenotypes suggest distinct functions of the introgressed alleles. In contrast, a block of genes in chromosome 12 paralogous to the introgressed region showed no signs of introgression or signatures of selection. We hypothesize that the introgressed region in chromosome 15 has introduced modular or cassette-like variation into P. trichocarpa. These linked adaptive mutations are associated with a block of genes in chromosome 15 that appear to have undergone neo-or subfunctionalization relative to paralogs in a duplicated region on chromosome 12 that show no signatures of adaptive variation. The association between P. balsamifera introgressed alleles with the expression of adaptive traits in P. trichocarpa supports the hypothesis that this is a case of adaptive introgression in an ecologically important foundation species.	2016	10.1111/mec.13539		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	stats inaccessible	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE

In this study, we use broad geographical and taxonomic sampling (2,219 individuals) to establish the distribution of species, hybrids and cryptic genetic variation within the conifer genus Picea (spruce) across western North America. We demonstrate that the six species of spruce in this region are distinguishable based on their genetic composition, and that the more closely related Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii) and white spruce (P. glauca) have generated numerous and widespread hybrids. These hybrids occur in the central Rocky Mountains, well to the south of the well-established region of admixture in Canada. Additionally, we provide evidence for subdivision within Engelmann spruce, manifested as a southern Rocky Mountains form, and a northern Rocky Mountain and Cascade mountains (western) form. In the intervening central Rocky Mountains region (forests in Wyoming and adjacent states) we found primarily individuals with admixed ancestry. Following their origin, these species of spruce have interacted repeatedly and in different geographical contexts. Multiple pairs of species have been shown to hybridize, yet the species persist and retain distinguishable compositions. At the same time, large geographical areas exist where hybrids are pervasive. Consequently, spruce provide a case study for the maintenance of species boundaries, particularly for how widespread hybridization need not lead to the collapse and loss of species.	2019	10.1111/mec.15056		Plants	Pinales	Picea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, Entropy	GBS	TRUE

Zecca, Giovanni; Labra, Massimo; Grassi, Fabrizio	Untangling the Evolution of American Wild Grapes: Admixed Species and How to Find Them	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Natural hybridization and introgression are central evolutionary processes in grape genus (Vitis). On the other hand, the interspecific relationships among grapes, the directionality of the inferred admixture events and the parents of hybrids are not yet completely clarified. The grapes are economically important crops characterized by tendrils used to climb on the trees and the fruits harvested by humans especially for the consumption or to produce wines and liquors. The American grapes (ca. 30 species) are recognized as an important resource because they show biotic and abiotic resistances. We analyzed 3,885 genome-wide SNPs from 31 American Vitis species using the TreeMix software combined with the f3 and f4 tests. This approach allowed us to infer phylogenetic relationships and to explore the natural admixture among taxa. Our results confirmed the existence of all hybrid species recognized in literature (V. x champinii, V. x doaniana, V. x novae-angliae, and V. x slavinii), identifying their most likely parent species and provided evidence of additional gene flows between distantly related species. We discuss our results to elucidate the origin of American wild grapes, demonstrating that admixture events have ancient origins. We observe that gene flows have involved taxa currently spread through the southern regions of North America. Consequently, we propose that glacial cycles could have triggered the contact between interfertile taxa promoting local hybridization events. We conclude by discussing the phylogenetic implications of our findings and showing that TreeMix can provide novel insights into the evolutionary history of grapes.	2020	10.3389/fpls.2019.01814		Plants	Vitales	Vitis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	f3, f4, trees	WGS	TRUE	
Lachmuth, Susanne; Molofsky, Jane; Milbrath, Lindsey; Suda, Jan; Keller, Stephen R.	Associations between genomic ancestry, genome size and capitula morphology in the invasive meadow knapweed hybrid complex (Centaurea x moncktonii) in eastern North America	AOB PLANTS	Plant invasions are prime opportunities for studying hybridization and the nature of species boundaries, but hybrids also complicate the taxonomic treatment and management of introduced taxa. In this study, we use population genomics to estimate the extent of genomic admixture and test for its association with morphology and genome size in a hybrid complex of knapweeds invasive to North America: meadow knapweed (Centaurea x moncktonii) and its parental species (C. jacea and C. nigra). We sampled 20 populations from New York and Vermont, USA, and used genotyping by sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in order to estimate genome-wide ancestry and classify individuals into hybrid genotype classes. We then tested for association between degree of genomic introgression and variation in a subset of traits diagnostic for the parental taxa, namely capitula morphology and monoploid genome size. Genomic clustering revealed two clearly defined lineages, as well as many admixed individuals forming a continuous gradation of introgression. Individual assignments to hybrid genotype classes revealed many advanced generation intercrosses and backcrosses, suggesting introgression has been extensive and unimpeded by strong reproductive barriers between taxa. Variation in capitula traits between the two unadmixed, presumed parental, lineages exhibited continuous, and in some cases transgressive, segregation among introgressed hybrids. Genome size was also divergent between lineages, although advanced generation hybrids had smaller genomes relative to additive expectations. Our study demonstrates deep introgression between the porous genomes of a hybrid invasive species complex. In addition to strong associations among genomic ancestry, genome size and morphology, hybrids expressed more extreme phenotypic values for capitula traits and genome size, indicating transgressive segregation, as well as a bias towards smaller genomes, possibly due to genomic downsizing. Future studies will apply these results to experimentally test how introgression, transgressive segregation and genome size reduction interact to confer invasiveness.	2019	10.1093/aobpla/plz055		Plants	Asterales	Centaurea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	Newhybrids, PCA, ADMIXTURE	GBS	TRUE	
de Lafontaine, Guillaume; Prunier, Julien; Gerardi, Sebastien; Bousquet, Jean	Tracking the progression of speciation: variable patterns of introgression across the genome provide insights on the species delimitation between progenitor-derivative spruces (Picea mariana x P-rubens)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The genic species concept implies that while most of the genome can be exchanged somewhat freely between species through introgression, some genomic regions remain impermeable to interspecific gene flow. Hence, interspecific differences can be maintained despite ongoing gene exchange within contact zones. This study assessed the heterogeneous patterns of introgression at gene loci across the hybrid zone of an incipient progenitor-derivative species pair, Picea mariana (black spruce) and Picea rubens (red spruce). The spruce taxa likely diverged in geographic isolation during the Pleistocene and came into secondary contact during late Holocene. A total of 300 SNPs distributed across the 12 linkage groups (LG) of black spruce were genotyped for 385 individual trees from 33 populations distributed across the allopatric zone of each species and within the zone of sympatry. An integrative framework combining three population genomic approaches was used to scan the genomes, revealing heterogeneous patterns of introgression. A total of 23 SNPs scattered over 10 LG were considered impermeable to introgression and putatively under diverging selection. These loci revealed the existence of impermeable genomic regions forming the species boundary and are thus indicative of ongoing speciation between these two genetic lineages. Another 238 SNPs reflected selectively neutral diffusion across the porous species barrier. Finally, 39 highly permeable SNPs suggested ancestral polymorphism along with balancing selection. The heterogeneous patterns of introgression across the genome indicated that the speciation process between black spruce and red spruce is young and incomplete, albeit some interspecific differences are maintained, allowing ongoing species divergence even in sympatry. The approach developed in this study can be used to track the progression of ongoing speciation processes.	2015	10.1111/mec.13377		Plants	Pinales	Picea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	clines, STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	exome (235 genes)	TRUE	
Alvarez, I; Wendel, JF	Cryptic interspecific introgression and genetic differentiation within Gossypium aridum (Malvaceae) and its relatives	EVOLUTION	Interspecific gene flow is increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary phenomenon in plants. A surprising observation is that historical introgression is often inferred between species that presently have geographic and reproductive barriers that would appear to prohibit the inferred sexual exchange. A striking example concerns Gossypium aridum (subsection Erioxylum); previous analyses have shown that populations from Colima (southwestern Mexico) have a chloroplast genome (cpDNA) similar to that of a different taxonomic subsection (Integrifolia) that presently is confined to Baja California and the Galapagos Islands, whereas other G. aridum populations share a cpDNA lineage with each other and with other species in subsection Erioxylum. To evaluate further the possibility that this cpDNA evidence reflects introgression as opposed to some other evolutionary process, as well as to explore patterns of genetic diversity and similarity in both subsections, we conducted amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis using 50 populations representing all seven species in the two subsections. Genetic diversity is high in G. aridum, and is strongly correlated with geography, as are similarities among the five species in subsection Erioxylum. This subsection is genetically distant from the two species in subsection Integrifolia, whose populations are highly similar inter se. Populations of G. aridum from Colima are genetically distinct from the remainder of the species, and exhibit a comparatively high frequency of AFLP fragments that otherwise are diagnostic of the Integrifolia lineage. These data implicate intersubsectional introgression between presently allopatric and genetically isolated clades, giving rise to a morphologically cryptic, introgressant entity. Biogeographic considerations suggest that this history was initiated following migration of one or more seeds from Baja California to the Colima coast, perhaps during the Pleistocene. We suggest that cryptic and seemingly improbable interspecific introgression and molecular differentiation may be more common than appreciated in angiosperm evolution.	2006	10.1554/05-184.1		Plants	Malvales	Gossypium	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	AFLP (496 loci)	TRUE	
Kadereit, JW; Uribe-Convers, S; Westberg, E; Comes, HP	Reciprocal hybridization at different times between Senecio flavus and Senecio glaucus gave rise to two polyploid species in north Africa and south-west Asia	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	The analysis of hybrid plant taxa using molecular methods has considerably extended understanding of possible pathways of hybrid evolution. Here, we investigated the origin of the tetraploid Senecio mohavensis ssp. breviflorus and the hexaploid Senecio hoggariensis by sequencing of nuclear and chloroplast DNA, and by analysis of the distribution of taxon-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments. Both taxa originated from hybridization between the diploid Senecio flavus and Senecio glaucus. Whereas S. glaucus was the female parent in the origin of S. mohavensis ssp. breviflorus, S. flavus was the female parent in the origin of S. hoggariensis. The distribution of AFLP fragments suggests that S. hoggariensis is an allohexaploid species with two diploid genomes of S. glaucus and one diploid genome of S. flavus. The high frequency of S. flavus-specific fragments in S. mohavensis ssp. breviflorus is explained either as the result of introgression between a primary hybrid and S. flavus or as the result of intergenomic recombination in a primary hybrid. These two alternative processes cannot easily be distinguished.	2006	10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01604.x		Plants	Asterales	Senecio	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	AFLP (596 loci)	TRUE

Genome-specific introgression between wheat and its wild relative Aegilops triuncialis	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Introgression of sequences from crop species in wild relatives is of fundamental and practical concern. Here, we address gene flow between cultivated wheat and its widespread polyploid relative, Aegilops triuncialis, using 12 EST-SSR markers mapped on wheat chromosomes. The presence of wheat diagnostic alleles in natural populations of the barbed goatgrass growing in proximity to cultivated fields highlights that substantial gene flow occurred when both species coexisted. Furthermore, loci from the A subgenome of wheat were significantly less introgressed than sequences from other subgenomes, indicating differential introgression into Ae. triuncialis. Gene flow between such species sharing nonhomeologous chromosomes addresses the evolutionary outcomes of hybridization and may be important for efficient gene containment.	2013	10.1111/jeb.12040		Plants	Poales	Aegilops	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	12 markers	TRUE	
Kim, Sang-Tae; Donoghue, Michael J.; Sultan, Sonia E.	On the resurrection of Persicaria puritanorum (Polygonaceae)	PHYTOTAXA	Pond populations in Cape Cod described as Persicaria puritanorum ( Polygonum puritanorum) have been treated by recent authors as a synonym of P. maculosa ( Polygonum persicaria) based on gross morphology. However, consistent differences in leaf and inflorescence features raise the question as to whether this is an extreme phenotype of P. maculosa, an ecotype of that species, or a distinct taxon. In this study, we analyzed nuclear ITS region and chloroplast matK region DNA sequences from 37 populations of 11 species within section Eupersicaria and counted the chromosome number of individuals from the pond populations in question. We also compared leaf size and shape of plants from these populations with those of the typical P. maculosa plants by measuring selected herbarium specimens. Phylogenetic trees inferred from sequence data indicate a separation of pond populations from P. maculosa suggesting to recover P. puritanorum as a distinct species. Chromosome counts of pond population plants (2n = 60) strongly support this result, and furthermore suggest the possibility of a hybrid polyploid origin of P. puritanorum. A leaf morphological trait (greater relative height of the maximum width point from the leaf base) also supports the separation of pond populations from P. maculosa. P. punctata allied to P. hydropiper in the ITS-based tree, and to pond populations as well as P. hydropiperoides and P. opelousana in the matK-based tree, suggesting the possibility of hybrid origin of P. punctata. Our ITS sequence analyses also reveal distinct two lineages in P. lapathifolia but the chloroplast matK region sequences of P. pensylvanica and two lineages of P. lapathifolia are almost identical suggesting cytoplasmic introgression or allopolyploid speciation sharing the maternal lineage.	2017	10.11646/phytotaxa.308.1.2		Plants	Caryophyllales	Persicaria	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Szczecinska, Monika; Lazarski, Grzegorz; Bilska, Katarzyna; Sawicki, Jakub	The complete plastid genome and nuclear genome markers provide molecular evidence for the hybrid origin of Pulsatilla x hackelii Pohl	TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY	This study presents the first molecularly proven data on natural hybridization in the genus Pulsatilla, including the complete plastome sequence. A plant with morphological characteristics intermediate between P. patens and P. pratensis was found near the village of Bocheniec (southern Poland). In this study, several classes of markers based on genotyping (SSR and ISJ) and sequencing (Sanger and NGS) were used to confirm hybridization and its direction, and to determine the prospective parent species. Analysis of ISJ and ISSR genotyping data revealed that all amplified loci were polymorphic. The hybrid species was characterized by only 3 specific bands, and it shared the highest number of bands with P. pratensis. A total of 3,204,448 pair- end reads (2 x 250 bp) from Pulsatilla x hackelii were obtained in a single run of the MiSeq sequencer. The structure of the hybrid plastid genome did not differ from the previously identified genomes of the Pulsatilla species. A phylogenetic analysis of plastomes in the Pulsatilla species revealed three well-supported clades. The plastome of Pulsatilla x hackelii was included in the P. pratensis clade. P. hackelii and P. pratensis formed a well-supported clade, and their plastomes differed by 78 substitutions and 74 indels. Most of these differences were found in intergenic noncoding regions (52 substitutions and 67 indels) and introns (11 substitutions and 5 indels). The sequenced plastid genome of the hybrid species was most similar to Pulsatilla pratensis, which suggests that the analyzed P. pratensis specimen was pollinated by P. patens.	2017	10.3906/bot-1610-28		Plants	Ranunculales	Pulsatilla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (6 genes)	TRUE	
Cinget, Benjamin; de Lafontaine, Guillaume; Gerardi, Sebastien; Bousquet, Jean	Integrating phylogeography and paleoecology to investigate the origin and dynamics of hybrid zones: insights from two widespread North American firs	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Secondary contact between closely related taxa routinely occurs during postglacial migrations. After initial contact, the location of hybrid zones may shift geographically or remain spatially stable over time in response to various selective pressures or neutral processes. Studying the extent and direction of introgression using markers having contrasted levels of gene flow can help unravel the historical dynamics of hybrid zones. Thanks to their contrasted maternal and paternal inheritance, resulting in different levels of gene flow for mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA (mtDNA and cpDNA), the Pinaceae stand out as a relevant biological model for this purpose. The objective of the study was to assess whether the hybrid zone between Abies balsamea and Abies lasiocarpa (two largely distributed Pinaceae) has moved or remained stable over time by analysing the distribution of cytoplasmic DNA variation as well as published palaeobotanical data. Interspecific gene flow was higher for cpDNA than mtDNA markers; hence, the geographic distribution of mitotypes was more congruent with species distributions than chlorotypes. This genetic signature was contrary to expectations under a moving hybrid zone scenario, as well as empirical observations in other conifers. Genetic evidence for this rare instance of stable hybrid zone was corroborated by the colonization chronology derived from published fossil data, indicating that the two fir species initially came into contact in the area corresponding to the current sympatric zone 11 kyr ago. While an explanatory analysis suggested the putative influence of various environmental factors on the relative abundance of cytoplasmic genome combinations, further research appears necessary to assess the role of both demographic history and selective factors in driving the dynamics of hybrid zones.	2015	10.1111/mec.13194		Plants	Pinales	Abies	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE

Plastid DNA haplotype diversity and morphological variation in the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex (Orchidaceae) in northern Poland	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	To gain an overview of the variation in the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex in northern Poland, ten plastid DNA regions (seven microsatellite and three indel loci) and 23 morphometric characters were used. In total, 972 and 480 samples from 64 and 31 populations were utilized for the genetic and morphometric analyses, respectively. One hundred and forty-one haplotypes that have not been reported previously were recognized. The continuity of morphological characters between the studied species and the impact of post-glacial colonization on the observed complexity in the Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata complex were concluded. It was confirmed that the allotetraploid group of D.majalis s.s. has inherited its plastid genome from D.maculata s.l., specifically from D.maculata ssp. fuchsii. In addition, some of the haplotypes found in D.majalis s.s. were distinct and evidently not present in the preserved D.maculata s.l. Although possible gene flow and introgression between two subspecies of the D.maculata s.l. group were indicated, we suggest that they should be treated as separate evolutionary units. Both the common and rare haplotypes show a similar pattern of geographical distribution for all four taxa analysed, which suggests that hybridization took place relatively recently, shortly after the retreat of the ice sheet.

Laureto, Pamela J.; Barkman, Todd J.	Nuclear and Chloroplast DNA Suggest a Complex Single Origin for the Threatened Allopolyploid Solidago houghtonii (Asteraceae) Involving Reticulate Evolution and Introgression	SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	Solidago houghtonii Torrey & A. Gray ex Gray is a federally threatened polyploid plant species likely of hybrid origin. Several hypothesized combinations of parental species have been suggested but none have been phylogenetically tested. Additionally, it is unclear whether the species is of single or polytopic origin. To study the evolutionary history of S. houghtonii we sequenced four noncoding cpDNA loci (accD-psal, pshA-trnH, trnL-trnF, rps16-trnQ), and the ITS and 3'ETS regions for four accessions of S. houghtonii, which span its geographic range, and 25 other species of Solidago including all sympatric species. Polymorphisms within the direct nrDNA sequences of all S. houghtonii accessions indicated the presence of multiple homoeologue types. These were separated by molecular cloning of the 3055 bp 3'ETS ITS region, allowing us to positively link the ETS and ITS homoeologue types. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear and chloroplast datasets revealed incongruent topologies. Analysis of cloned nrDNA sequence data indicated that S. riddellii, S. ptamicoides, and S. ohioensis have contributed to the nuclear genome of S. houghtonii. Analysis of cpDNA sequence data revealed the presence of multiple insertions/deletions that are shared by all accessions. The unique pattern of cpDNA indels was also recovered in S. gigantea. Phylogenetic analysis of the cpDNA sequence data and coded indels indicate S. gigantea is the maternal genome donor. However, we did not recover a S. gigantea nrDNA sequence type. Taken together, these data reveal both a single origin and a complex pattern of reticulation that is consistent not only with the hypothesized allohexaploid nature of this species, but also with chloroplast capture of cpDNA from an unexpected source through introgression.	2011	10.1600/036364411X553289		Plants	Asterales	Solidago	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (5 genes)	TRUE	
Eriksson, J. S.; Blanco-Pastor, J. L.; Sousa, F.; Bertrand, Y. J. K.; Pfeil, B. E.	A cryptic species produced by autopolyploidy and subsequent introgression involving Medicago prostrata (Fabaceae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Although hybridisation through genome duplication is well known, hybridisation without genome duplication (homoploid hybrid speciation, HHS) is not. Few well-documented cases have been reported. A possible instance of HHS in Medicago prostrata Jacq. was suggested previously, based on only two genes and one individual. We tested whether this species was formed through HHS by sampling eight nuclear loci and 22 individuals, with additional individuals from related species, using gene capture and Illumina sequencing. Phylogenetic inference and coalescent simulations were performed to infer the causes of gene tree incongruence. We found no evidence that phylogenetic differences among M. prostrata individuals were the result of HHS. Instead, an autopolyploid origin of tetraploids with introgression from tetraploids of the M. sativa complex is likely. We argue that tetraploid M. prostrata individuals constitute a new species, characterised by a partially non-overlapping distribution and distinctive alleles (from the M. sativa complex). No gene flow from tetraploid to diploid M. prostrata is apparent, suggesting partial reproductive isolation. Thus, speciation via autopolyploidy appears to have been reinforced by introgression. This raises the intriguing possibility that introgressed alleles may be responsible for the increased range exploited by tetraploid M. prostrata with respect to that of the diploids.

Oueslati, Amel; Salhi-Hannachi, Amel; Luro, Francois; Vignes, Helene; Mournet, Pierre; Ollitrault, Patrick	Genotyping by sequencing reveals the interspecific C. maxima / C. reticulata admixture along the genomes of modern citrus varieties of mandarins, tangors, tangelos, orangelos and grapefruits	PLOS ONE	The mandarin horticultural group is an important component of world citrus production for the fresh fruit market. This group formerly classified as C. reticulata is highly polymorphic and recent molecular studies have suggested that numerous cultivated mandarins were introgressed by C. maxima (the pummelos). C. maxima and C. reticulata are also the ancestors of sweet and sour oranges, grapefruit, and therefore of all the "small citrus" modern varieties (mandarins, tangors, tangelos) derived from sexual hybridization between these horticultural groups. Recently, NGS technologies have greatly modified how plant evolution and genomic structure are analyzed, moving from phylogenetics to phylogenomics. The objective of this work was to develop a workflow for phylogenomic inference from Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) data and to analyze the interspecific admixture along the nine citrus chromosomes for horticultural groups and recent varieties resulting from the combination of the C. reticulata and C. maxima gene pools. A GBS library was established from 55 citrus varieties, using the ApekI restriction enzyme and selective PCR to improve the read depth. Diagnostic polymorphisms (DPs) of C. reticulata/C. maxima differentiation were identified and used to decipher the phylogenomic structure of the 55 varieties. The GBS approach was powerful and revealed 30,289 SNPs and 8,794 Indels with 12.6% of missing data. 11,133 DPs were selected covering the nine chromosomes with a higher density in genic regions. GBS combined with the detection of DPs was powerful for deciphering the "phylogenomic karyotypes" of cultivars derived from admixture of the two ancestral species after a limited number of interspecific recombinations. All the mandarins, mandarin hybrids, tangelos and tangors analyzed displayed introgression of C. maxima in different parts of the genome. C. reticulata/C. maxima admixture should be a major component of the high phenotypic variability of this germplasm opening up the way for association studies based on phylogenomics.	2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0185618		Plants	Sapindales	Citrus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	GBS (10000 loci)	TRUE	
Owusu, Sandra A.; Sullivan, Alexis R.; Weber, Jaime A.; Hipp, Andrew L.; Gailing, Oliver	Taxonomic Relationships and Gene Flow in Four North American Quercus Species (Quercus section Lobatae)	SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	Taxonomic relationships between North American red oak species (Quercus section Lobatae) are not well resolved using genetic and morphological markers. Phenotypic plasticity, recent species divergence, and hybridization may all contribute to the unclear species boundaries in red oaks. We applied twenty-eight genomic and gene-basedmicrosatellites, including outlier loci with potential roles in reproductive isolation and adaptive divergence between species, to natural populations of four monophyletic interfertile oak species: Quercus ellipsoidalis, Q. coccinea, Q. rubra, and Q. velutina. To better resolve the taxonomic relationships in this difficult clade, we assigned individual samples to species, identified hybrids and introgressive forms, and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the four species after exclusion of genetically intermediate individuals. Genetic assignment analyses identified four distinct species clusters, with Q. rubra most differentiated from the three other species. However, especially between Q. ellipsoidalis and Q. velutina, a comparatively large number of misclassified individuals (7.14%), hybrids (7.14%), and introgressive forms (18.83%) were detected. After the exclusion of genetically intermediate individuals, Q. ellipsoidalis grouped as sister species to the largely parapatric Q. coccinea with high bootstrap support (91%). Genetically intermediate forms in a mixed species stand were located proximate to both potential parental species, which supports recent hybridization of Q. velutina with both Q. ellipsoidalis and Q. rubra. Analyses of genome-wide patterns of interspecific differentiation can provide a better understanding of speciation processes and taxonomic relationships in this taxonomically difficult group of red oak species.	2015	10.1600/036364415X688754		Plants	Fagales	Quercus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, PCA, trees	microsattelite (28 markers)	TRUE	
Rifkin, Joanna L.; Castillo, Allan S.; Liao, Irene T.; Rausher, Mark D.	Gene flow, divergent selection and resistance to introgression in two species of morning glories (Ipomoea)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Gene flow is thought to impede genetic divergence and speciation by homogenizing genomes. Recent theory and research suggest that sufficiently strong divergent selection can overpower gene flow, leading to loci that are highly differentiated compared to others. However, there are also alternative explanations for this pattern. Independent evidence that loci in highly differentiated regions are under divergent selection would allow these explanations to be distinguished, but such evidence is scarce. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence that many of the highly divergent SNPs in a pair of sister morning glory species, Ipomoea cordatotriloba and I. lacunosa, are the result of divergent selection in the face of gene flow. We analysed a SNP data set across the genome to assess the amount of gene flow, resistance to introgression and patterns of selection on loci resistant to introgression. We show that differentiation between the two species is much lower in sympatry than in allopatry, consistent with interspecific gene flow in sympatry. Gene flow appears to be substantially greater from I. lacunosa to I. cordatotriloba than in the reverse direction, resulting in sympatric and allopatric I. cordatotriloba being substantially more different than sympatric and allopatric I. lacunosa. Many SNPs highly differentiated in allopatry have experienced divergent selection, and, despite gene flow in sympatry, resist homogenization in sympatry. Finally, five out of eight floral and inflorescence characteristics measured exhibit asymmetric convergence in sympatry. Consistent with the pattern of gene flow, I. cordatotriloba traits become much more like those of I. lacunosa than the reverse. Our investigation reveals the complex interplay between selection and gene flow that can occur during the early stages of speciation.	2019	10.1111/mec.14945		Plants	Solanales	Ipomea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	transcriptome	TRUE	
Hoerandl, Elvira; Greilhuber, Johann; Klimova, Katarina; Paun, Ovidiu; Temsch, Eva; Emadzade, Khatere; Hodalova, Iva	Reticulate evolution and taxonomic concepts in the Ranunculus auricomus complex (Ranunculaceae): insights from analysis of morphological, karyological and molecular data	TAXON	The Ranunculus auricomus complex is an interesting model system for studying the evolution and diversity of apomictic polyploid complexes. It comprises hundreds of agamospecies, usually referred to two distinct morphotypes (traditionally named "R. auricomus" and "R. cassubicus") which are connected by several intermediate forms. Here we try to elucidate the evolution of apomictic "cassubicus" morphotypes and we test criteria for different classification concepts by combining the information of molecular phylogenetic, morphological, karyological and population genetic data (AFLPs, amplified fragment length polymorphism). Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the nrDNA ITS and plastid data (matK, trnk, psbJ-psbA) suggest a deep split between the diploid sexual species R. notabilis ("auricomus" morphotype) from the closely related allopatric taxa R. cassubicifolius and R. carpaticola ("cassubicus"). The apomictic "cassubicus" morphotypes are not monophyletic, as one, R. hungaricus, groups with R. notabilis, which may be due to hybrid origin. Morphometric studies and ploidy level determinations via Feulgen densitometry show a transition from 4x R. hungaricus to the 6x apomictic hybrid derivatives of R. cassubicifolius and R. carpaticola. In two accessions, AFLPs and flow cytometric data suggest local gene flow among different apomictic polyploid morphotypes. Frequent facultative sexuality of apomicts may increase genetic diversity by continuous formation of new cytotypes, local hybridization and introgression, which obstructs the fixation of distinct agamospecies. We conclude that "R. cassubicus" and "R. auricomus" cannot be regarded as species but should be treated as either informal groups, or as (notho)taxa at the sectional level. To reflect the different evolutionary processes involved, we propose a separate classification of the sexual species, R. notabilis and the closely related species pair R. cassubicifolius and R. carpaticola.

Ren, Xiaoping; Huang, Jiaquan; Liao, Boshou; Zhang, Xiaojie; Jiang, Huifang	Genomic affinities of Arachis genus and interspecific hybrids were revealed by SRAP markers	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	The Arachis genus is native to South America, and contains 70-80 described species assembled into nine sections. A better understanding of the level of speciation and taxonomic relationships is a prerequisite to the effective use of Arachis species in peanut breeding programs. Forty-eight genotypes representing 19 species in 6 sections were evaluated to assay the genetic variability within and among species, and 10 recombinant lines and those parents were identified with introgression of Arachis species chromosome segments into A. hypogaea genome using SRAP markers. Sixty of sixty-four SRAP primers tested were selected for DNA amplification reactions. A dendrogram and principal component analysis were constructed based on 353 SRAP polymorphic bands of the accessions. The number of scored polymorphic bands per each primer combination varied from 1 to 25 with an average of 5.9 per reaction. Estimates of genetic distance among the 48 accessions Arachis species ranged from 0.11 to 0.76. A-genome accessions 475845 (A. duranensis), and 331197 (A. villosa) were most closely associated to A. hypogaea. The first two PCAs accounted for 77.74% (62.02 and 15.72%) of the total variation observed and separated the different genomic groups. SRAPs also identified introgression of Arachis species chromosome segments into A. hypogaea. genome with 10 recombinant lines and those parents. The present results indicated that SRAPs can be used to determine the genetic relationships among species of the different sections of the genus Arachis and to identify introgression of Arachis genus chromosome segments into A. hypogaea genome.	2010	10.1007/s10722-010-9532-1		Plants	Fabales	Arachis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity, PCA	AFLP	TRUE

Genome sequence of dwarf birch (Betula nana) and cross-species RAD markers	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	New sequencing technologies allow development of genome-wide markers for any genus of ecological interest, including plant genera such as Betula (birch) that have previously proved difficult to study due to widespread polyploidy and hybridization. We present a de novo reference genome sequence assembly, from 66x short read coverage, of Betula nana (dwarf birch) - a diploid that is the keystone woody species of subarctic scrub communities but of conservation concern in Britain. We also present 100bp PstI RAD markers for B. nana and closely related Betula tree species. Assembly of RAD markers in 15 individuals by alignment to the reference B. nana genome yielded 44-86k RAD loci per individual, whereas de novo RAD assembly yielded 64-121k loci per individual. Of the loci assembled by the de novo method, 3k homologous loci were found in all 15 individuals studied, and 35k in 10 or more individuals. Matching of RAD loci to RAD locus catalogues from the B. nana individual used for the reference genome showed similar numbers of matches from both methods of RAD locus assembly but indicated that the de novo RAD assembly method may overassemble some paralogous loci. In 12 individuals hetero-specific to B. nana 37-47k RAD loci matched a catalogue of RAD loci from the B. nana individual used for the reference genome, whereas 44-60k RAD loci aligned to the B. nana reference genome itself. We present a preliminary study of allele sharing among species, demonstrating the utility of the data for introgression studies and for the identification of species-specific alleles.	2013	10.1111/mec.12131		Plants	Fagales	Betula	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	RAD (44000 loci)	TRUE	
Holman, Garth; Del Tredici, Peter; Havill, Nathan; Lee, Nam Sook; Cronn, Richard; Cushman, Kevin; Mathews, Sarah; Raubeson, Linda; Campbell, Christopher S.	A New Species and Introgression in Eastern Asian Hemlocks (Pinaceae: Tsuga)	SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	Species delimitation in Pinaceae is often challenged by limited morphological differentiation and introgression. In Tsuga (hemlocks), species delimitation has been most challenging among northeastern Asian taxa, where the species are weakly marked morphologically and range in number from three to five in previous studies. Two low-copy nuclear four-coumarase-ligase (4CL) genes andmorphology strongly support a clade of the Japanese endemic T. diversifolia and T. sieboldii from Japan and Ulleung island (Ulleungdo) in Korea. This clade is here referred to as the oceanic hemlocks. 4CL strongly supports a sister-group relationship of the widespread northeastern Asian T. chinensis and eastern North American T. caroliniana. In contrast, chloroplast genomes, which are markedly reduced in Tsuga and relatives, strongly support Japanese T. sieboldii as sister to T. chinensis and moderately support T. caroliniana as sister to a clade of T. diversifolia and hemlocks fromUlleungdo. These divergent topologies suggest chloroplast capture of T. chinensis by Japanese T. sieboldii. Ulleungdo hemlocks are distinct from other northeastern Asian species in leaf and cone morphology and phenologically in common-garden observations. We therefore describe these hemlocks as a new species, T. ulleungensis.	2017	10.1600/036364417X696474		Plants	Pinales	Tsuga	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity, morphology	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE

Flow cytometry analyses detected ploidy polymorphisms of 2x and 4x in Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. kamchatica of Taiwan. Genomic divergence between species/subspecies was estimated based on 98 randomly chosen nuclear genes. Multilocus analyses revealed a mosaic genome in diploid A. l. kamchatica composed of Arabidopsis halleri-like and A. lyrata-like alleles. Coalescent analyses suggest that the segregation of ancestral polymorphisms alone cannot explain the high inconsistency between gene trees across loci, and that gene introgression via diploid A. l. kamchatica likely distorts the molecular phylogenies of Arabidopsis species. However, not all genes migrated across species freely. Gene ontology analyses suggested that some nonmigrating genes were constrained by natural selection. High levels of estimated ancestral polymorphisms between A. halleri and A. lyrata suggest that gene flow between these species has not completely ceased since their initial isolation. Polymorphism data of extant populations also imply recent gene flow between the species. Our study reveals that interspecific gene flow affects the genome evolution in Arabidopsis.	2010	10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03383.x		Plants	Brassicales	Arabidopsis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, demography	Sanger (98 genes)	TRUE

Karrenberg, Sophie; Favre, Adrien	Genetic and ecological differentiation in the hybridizing campions Silene dioica and S-latifolia	EVOLUTION	Ecological differentiation is a major contributor to the generation and maintenance of biological diversity. We investigated habitat differentiation between and within sites in the fully cross-fertile and hybridizing Silene dioica and S. latifolia using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) profiles and corresponding vegetation releves around individual plants. Nineteen study sites in the Swiss Alps included pure sites and contact sites (both taxa present within 30 m). In pure sites and at contact sites, the two taxa showed consistently differentiated AFLP banding patterns across regions but few discriminating bands. This indicates that although the two taxa are weakly differentiated, current introgression has not led to genome-wide admixture. Only three putative early generation hybrids were detected at contact sites. The habitats of the two taxa differed between pure sites with S. dioica occurring in moister, colder, and less-disturbed sites than S. latifolia. However, asymmetric habitat overlap was evident within contact sites found in intermediate conditions that were more similar to S. latifolia sites. This situation might favor introgression from S. dioica into S. latifolia. Evidence for habitat-genotype associations within contact sites was weak making habitat-mediated selection against intermediate phenotypes of hybrids unlikely in the contact sites investigated. We suggest that other reproductive barriers together with dispersal limitation contribute to the rarity of early generation hybrids.	2008	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00330.x		Plants	Caryophyllales	Silene	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	AFLP	TRUE	
Yatabe, Yoko; Kane, Nolan C.; Scotti-Saintagne, Caroline; Rieseberg, Loren H.	Rampant gene exchange across a strong reproductive barrier between the annual sunflowers, Helianthus annuus and H-petiolaris	GENETICS	Plant species may remain morphologically distinct despite gene exchange with congeners, yet little is known about the genomewide pattern of introgression among species. Here we analyze the effects of persistent gene flow on genomic differentiation between the sympatric sunflower species Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris. While the species are strongly isolated in testcrosses, genetic distances at 108 microsatellite loci and 14 sequenced genes are highly variable and much lower (on average) than for more closely related but historically allopatric congeners. Our analyses failed to detect a positive association between levels of genetic differentiation and chromosomal rearrangements (as reported in a prior publication) or proximity to QTL for morphological differences or hybrid sterility. However, a significant increase in differentiation was observed for markers within 5 cM of chromosomal breakpoints. Together, these results suggest that islands of differentiation between these two species are small, except in areas of low recombination. Furthermore, only microsatellites associated with ESTs were identified as outlier loci in tests for selection, which might indicate that the ESTs themselves are the targets of selection rather than linked genes (or that coding regions are not randomly distributed). In general, these results indicate that even strong and genetically complex reproductive barriers cannot prevent widespread introgression.	2007	10.1534/genetics.106.064469		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	Sanger (14 loci), microsattelites	TRUE	
Kuroda, Y.; Kaga, A.; Tomooka, N.; Vaughan, D.	The origin and fate of morphological intermediates between wild and cultivated soybeans in their natural habitats in Japan	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The spread of transgenes into the genome of wild soybean is a concern when transgenic and wild soybeans are planted sympatrically. The objectives of this study were to investigate the origin and fate of morphological intermediates between wild and cultivated soybeans in their natural habitats in Japan. Twenty nuclear microsatellite and two chloroplast dCAPS markers were used to evaluate genetic variation of 468 wild, 17 intermediate, and 12 cultivated soybean samples collected from six sites between 2003 and 2006. Allelic differentiation of microsatellite markers between wild and cultivated soybeans was sufficient to detect their hybrids. Based on levels of observed heterozygosity, intermediate soybean plants were from two generations: either F(1) or an early segregating generation. Genetic admixture analysis and parentage assignment analysis revealed that the parents of all intermediate soybean plants could be assigned to a particular wild soybean plant and late-maturing cultivar. The chloroplast DNA haplotypes revealed that all intermediate soybean plants originated from gene flow from cultivated to wild soybeans at all sites. Based on monitoring at both the phenotypic and molecular levels, hybrids quickly disappeared from natural habitats, and secondary gene flow from these plants to wild soybean was not detected. Thus, while gene flow from transgenic soybean into wild soybean can occur, gene introgression appears to be rare in natural habitats in Japan. This is the first report on the detection of gene flow from cultivated to wild soybean at the molecular level.	2010	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04636.x		Plants	Fabales	Glycine	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelite (20 loci), Sanger (1 locus)	TRUE

We examined the genetic structure of a species complex in the tree genus Carapa in the Neotropics in order to evaluate age, geographic patterns of diversity and evolutionary relationships, and to quantify levels of introgression among currently recognized species. Location Lowland moist forests in the Guiana Shield, the Central and Western Amazon Basin, Choco and Central America. Methods Genetic structure was analysed using seven nuclear simple sequence repeats (nuSSR), five chloroplast SSRs (cpSSR), and two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) intergenic sequences (trnHpsbA and trnCycf6). Bayesian clustering analysis of the SSR data was used to infer population genetic structure and to assign 324 samples to their most likely genetic cluster. Bayesian coalescence analyses were performed on the two cpDNA markers to estimate evolutionary relationships and divergence times. Results Two genetic clusters (nu_guianensis and nu_surinamensis) were detected, which correspond to the Neotropical species C. guianensis (sensu latu) and C. surinamensis. Fourteen cpDNA haplotypes clustered into six haplogroups distributed between the two nuclear genetic clusters. Divergence between the haplogroups was initiated in the Miocene, with some haplotype structure evolving as recently as the Pleistocene. The absence of complete lineage sorting between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes and the presence of hybrid individuals suggest that interspecific reproductive barriers are incomplete. NuSSR diversity was highest in C. guianensis and, within C. guianensis, cpDNA diversity was highest in the Central and Western Amazon Basin. Regional genetic differentiation was strong but did not conform to an isolation-by-distance process or exhibit a phylogeographical signal. Main conclusions The biogeographical history of Neotropical Carapa appears to have been influenced by events that took place during the Neogene. Our results point to an Amazonian centre of origin and diversification of Neotropical Carapa, with subsequent migration to the Pacific coast of South America and Central America. Gene flow apparently occurs among species, and introgression events are supported by inconsistencies between chloroplast and nuclear lineage sorting. The absence of phylogeographical structure may be a result of the ineffectiveness of geographical barriers among populations and of reproductive isolation mechanisms among incipient and cryptic species in this species complex.	2013	10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02678.x		Plants	Sapindales	Carapa	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE

Burgess, KS; Morgan, M; Deverno, L; Husband, BC	Asymmetrical introgression between two Morus species (M-alba, M-rubra) that differ in abundance	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Asymmetrical introgression is an expected genetic consequence of hybridization when parental taxa differ in abundance; however, evidence for such effects in small populations is scarce. To test this prediction, we estimated the magnitude and direction of hybridization between red mulberry (Morus rubra L.), an endangered species in Canada, and the introduced and more abundant white mulberry (Morus alba L.) using nuclear (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA) and cytoplasmic (chloroplast DNA sequence) markers. Parentage of 184 trees (n = 42 using cpDNA) from four sympatric populations was estimated using a hybrid index and related to six morphological characters and population frequencies of the parental classes. Overall, the frequency of nuclear hybrids was 53.7% (n = 99) and ranged from 43% to 67% among populations. The parental and hybrid taxa differed with respect to all of the morphological traits. Sixty-seven percent of all hybrids contained more nuclear markers from M. alba than M. rubra (hybrid index x = 0.46); among populations, the degree of M. alba bias was correlated with the frequency of M. alba. In addition, the majority of hybrids (68%) contained the chloroplast genome of white mulberry. These results suggest that introgression is bidirectional but asymmetrical and is related, in part, to the relative frequency of parental taxa.	2005	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02670.x		Plants	Rosales	Morus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, hybrid index	RAPD (100)	TRUE	
Lexer, C.; Buerkle, C. A.; Joseph, J. A.; Heinze, B.; Fay, M. F.	Admixture in European Populus hybrid zones makes feasible the mapping of loci that contribute to reproductive isolation and trait differences	HEREDITY	The use of admixed human populations to scan the genome for chromosomal segments affecting complex phenotypic traits has proved a powerful analytical tool. However, its potential in other organisms has not yet been evaluated. Here, we use DNA microsatellites to assess the feasibility of this approach in hybrid zones between two members of the 'model tree' genus Populus: Populus alba (white poplar) and Populus tremula (European aspen). We analyzed samples of both species and a Central European hybrid zone (N = 544 chromosomes) for a genome-wide set of 19 polymorphic DNA microsatellites. Our results indicate that allele frequency differentials between the two species are substantial (mean delta = 0.619 +/- 0.067). Background linkage disequilibrium (LD) in samples of the parental gene pools is moderate and should respond to sampling schemes that minimize drift and account for rare alleles. LD in hybrids decays with increasing number of backcross generations as expected from theory and approaches background levels of the parental gene pools in advanced generation backcrosses. Introgression from P. tremula into P. alba varies strongly across marker loci. For several markers, alleles from P. tremula are slightly over-represented relative to neutral expectations, whereas a single locus exhibits evidence of selection against P. tremula genotypes. We interpret our results in terms of the potential for admixture mapping in these two ecologically divergent Populus species, and we validate a modified approach of studying genotypic clines in 'mosaic' hybrid zones.	2007	10.1038/sj.hdy.6800898		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, STRUCTURE	microsattelite (19), Sanger (1)	TRUE	
MacKay, Ron; Reid, Sarah; William, Robert; Hill, Nicholas M.	GENETIC EVIDENCE OF INTROGRESSIVE INVASION OF THE GLOBALLY IMPERILED SCIRPUS LONGII BY THE WEEDY SCIRPUS CYPERINUS (CYPERACEAE) IN NOVA SCOTIA	RHODORA	Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to determine whether populations of the global rarity Scirpus longii (Long's bulrush) are vulnerable to loss by introgression of genetic material from the weedy S. cyperinus (woolgrass). Shoots from 104 Scirpus plants were obtained from 10 sites in the watershed of the lower Medway River in Nova Scotia, Canada. A putative site of introgression (a seasonally flooded bog) was divided into five subsites: one large stand of vegetative plants and four patches of annually flowering plants clustered at one end of the site. Thirty-five dominant DNA markers were found among individuals from all sites and eight species-specific markers were identified for each of the two species. Nineteen different combinations of species-specific markers were present in the 39 individuals from the site of introgression, and, as expected for introgression, there was strong correlation (r = -0.80, p < 0.0001) between the numbers of the two types of markers. The vegetative and flowering subsites had distinctive hybrid indices: 0.76 and 0.27 of S. longii genome, respectively. The former indicates that S. cyperinus contributed about one-quarter of the genetic material of the plants from the subsite that accounts for more than 99% of the Scirpus at the site of introgression. Hybrid indices also show evidence of introgression in two of the 12 plants obtained at one of the presumed S. longii sites. Our results indicate that gene flow has occurred between S. cyperinus and S. longii at two S. longii populations, hybrid plants are capable of sexual reproduction, and Long's bulrush in Nova Scotia is vulnerable to loss by introgression. Conservation at the landscape level is needed to suppress anthropogenic disturbances that might allow S. cyperinus to threaten the genetic integrity of S. longii.	2010	10.3119/08-22.1		Plants	Poales	Scirpus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	RAPD (35)	TRUE

Here we sequence and compare citrus genomes-a high-quality reference haploid clementine genome and mandarin, pummelo, sweet-orange and sour-orange genomes- and show that cultivated types derive from two progenitor species. Although cultivated pummelos represent selections from one progenitor species, Citrus maxima, cultivated mandarins are introgressions of C. maxima into the ancestral mandarin species Citrus reticulata. The most widely cultivated citrus, sweet orange, is the offspring of previously admixed individuals, but sour orange is an F1 hybrid of pure C. maxima and C. reticulata parents, thus implying that wild mandarins were part of the early breeding germplasm. A Chinese wild 'mandarin' diverges substantially from C. reticulata, thus suggesting the possibility of other unrecognized wild citrus species. Understanding citrus phylogeny through genome analysis clarifies taxonomic relationships and facilitates sequence-directed genetic improvement.	2014	10.1038/nbt.2906		Plants	Sapindales	Citrus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	HMM	WGS	TRUE	
Gabriel Segarra-Moragues, Jose; Villar, Luis; Lopez, Josefa; Perez-Collazos, Ernesto; Catalan, Pilar	A new Pyrenean hybrid Cirsium (Asteraceae) as revealed by morphological and molecular analyses	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	A new nothosubspecies Cirsium x vivantii is described after a molecular and morphological characterization of eight individuals collected in two separate valleys of the French central Pyrenees. Both hypervariable Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers and nuclear rDNA (ITS) and plastid (trnL-F, TRNT-L) DNA sequences were analysed. The profiles of these hybrid samples were compared to those of 43 individuals belonging to their presumed parental taxa C. carniolicurn ssp. rufescens and C. palustre. A total of 133 AFLP bands were scored from three primer-pair combinations. All 130 AFLP bands that amplified in the hybrid samples were present in either C. carniolicurn ssp. rufescens, C. palustre or both taxa, supporting the participation of these plant genomes in the resulting hybrids. Several Additive Polymorphic Sites (APS) detected in the ITS sequences of the hybrid samples also confirmed their derived origins from ribotypes of the two parental taxa. The lack of exclusive AFLP markers and the nonconcerted evolution of rDNA polymorphisms towards either of the parental ribotypes indicated their recent origin. Plastid trnT-L sequences were used to identify C. palustre as the maternal parent of six of these hybrid individuals; either parent could have acted as the plastid genome donor for the other two individuals. The morphological study revealed that all hybrid individuals were morphologically intermediate between their parents showing largely lobed and less spiny basal leaves as in C. carniolicurn ssp. rufescens and decurrent leaf bases and pinkish corollas as in C. palustre.

Meirmans, Patrick G.; Lamothe, Manuel; Gros-Louis, Marie-Claude; Khasa, Damase; Perinet, Pierre; Bousquet, Jean; Isabel, Nathalie	COMPLEX PATTERNS OF HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN EXOTIC AND NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN POPLAR SPECIES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise of the study: Poplars and their hybrids are seen as important candidates for bioenergy initiatives. However, many concerns have been raised about large-scale plantations of new poplar cultivars. The deployment of such plants with novel traits brings the risk of potential spread of novel genome regions (including exotic genes, transgenes, or other heritable modifications) into natural populations of related species. The possibility of introgression is especially high in poplars because reproductive barriers between species are weak. Knowledge of the frequency of hybridization between cultivated trees and natural populations is one important step in the risk-assessment process. Methods: We studied the rate of spontaneous hybridization from two sexually mature poplar plantations into adjacent natural populations of Populus deltoides and P. balsamifera. The two plantations, both in eastern Canada, contain many different complex hybrid clones with components from exotic species, mostly P. nigra, P. trichocarpa, and P. maximowiczii. We analyzed 12 species-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms from six different genes in 5373 offspring sampled from the natural populations. Results: Contributions from all three exotics were found in the offspring, confirming low reproductive barriers among poplar species in these sections. The frequency of hybrid offspring varied among pollen donors, recipient populations, and years. Conclusions: The remarkably high rate of hybridization that was found in the smallest natural population sampled suggests that small peripheral populations carry a higher risk of introgression. These results could be used as a starting point for developing regulatory guidelines for the introduction of plants with novel traits.	2010	10.3732/ajb.0900271		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	microarray	TRUE	
Havananda, Tee; Brummer, E. Charles; Doyle, Jeff J.	COMPLEX PATTERNS OF AUTOPOLYPLOID EVOLUTION IN ALFALFA AND ALLIES (MEDICAGO SATIVA; LEGUMINOSAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise of the study: Although there is growing evidence that autopolyploidy is a widespread and important evolutionary phenomenon, it has received less attention than allopolyploidy. Medicago sativa comprises several diploid and autopolyploid taxa, including autotetraploid cultivated alfalfa, and affords an opportunity to elucidate the evolutionary history of a morphologically and genetically complex autopolyploid system. Methods: Phylogenies and haplotype networks were constructed from two chloroplast noncoding regions (rpl20-rps12 and trnS-trnG spacers) across seven diploid and polyploid infraspecific taxa of M. sativa and five additional closely related Medicago species, and genetic differentiation was estimated. Key results: The two most prominent M. sativa autopolyploids have contrasting evolutionary histories. Chloroplast data support a simple autopolyploid origin of subsp. sativa (alfalfa) from diploid subsp. caerulea, from which it is distinguishable in several quantitative characters. In contrast, morphologically identical diploid and autopolyploid cytotypes of subsp. falcata were found to possess very different chloroplast haplotypes, suggesting past introgression from M. prostrata into the polyploid. Despite the presence of hybrids between tetraploid subspecies falcata and sativa, there was little evidence of introgression of chloroplast genomes from either subspecies into the other. Conclusions: Autopolyploid evolution in M. sativa is complicated and has followed very different paths in different subspecific taxa. The potential exists for gene flow in virtually all combinations of subspecies both within and between ploidies, yet despite the existence of hybrids, morphologically and genetically distinctive subspecies persist.	2011	10.3732/ajb.1000318		Plants	Fabales	Medicago	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE	
Nakamura, Ikuo; Rai, Bhuwan; Takahashi, Hiroko; Kato, Kenji; Sato, Yo-ichiro; Komatsuda, Takao	Aegilops section Sitopsis species contains the introgressive PolA1 gene with a closer relationship to that of Hordeum than Triticum-Aegilops species	BREEDING SCIENCE	The section Sitopsis in the genus Aegilops includes five species.. Ae. speltoides, Ae. longissima, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. searsii, and Ae. bicornis, which share the SS genome. Although extensive molecular studies have indicated Ae. speltoides as a donor of BB or GG genome to polyploid wheat species, the precise relationships among SS, B B, and GG genomes remain unclear. PolA1 is a single-copy nuclear gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I. Highly polymorphic PolA1 exon 20 sequences were analyzed for 11 Triticum-Aegilops, 13 Hordeum and three related species. Phylogenetic analyses of the PolA1 gene showed that Triticum-Aegilops and Hordeum species were distinctly separated into two clades. Two related species, Secale cereale and Dasypyrum villosum, were grouped into Triticum and Hordeum clades, respectively. Interestingly, seven accessions of the Sitopsis species were clustered into the Hordeum clade whereas two accessions belonged to the Triticum clade. In contrast, all accessions of Sitopsis species shared the same haplotype of plastid PSID sequences with Triticum-Aegilops species. This inconsistency in phylogeny between nuclear and cytoplasmic sequences suggested that the Sitopsis species probably originated through introgressive hybridization between ancestral species of Triticum-Aegilops and Hordeum.	2009	10.1270/jsbbs.59.602		Plants	Poales	Aegilops	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
Nitta, Joel H.; Ebihara, Atsushi; Ito, Motomi	RETICULATE EVOLUTION IN THE CREPIDOMANES MINUTUM SPECIES COMPLEX (HYMENOPHYLLACEAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise of the Study: Hybridization is an important mechanism of speciation in plants and often results in complexes that comprise multiple sexual diploids and their hybrid offspring. However, the intricacy of these systems has prevented a thorough understanding of many groups. The Crepidomanes minutum species complex (Hymenophyllaceae) is a widely distributed, morphologically variable fern species complex. Although prior reports of apogamy and polyploidy suggest hybridization, it has never been the focus of a phylogenetic study. Methods: Morphology, nuclear (gapCp), and chloroplast (rbcL) DNA sequences, cytology, field observation, and spore counts were used to infer phylogeny and trace hybrid origins. Key Results: The C. minutum species complex is composed of at least three major clades: the African clade, clade 1 (East Asia and the Pacific), and clade 2 (Southeast Asia and the South Pacific). Clades 1 and 2 differ strikingly in morphological variation (uniform in clade 1 vs. highly variable in clade 2) and occurrence of hybrids (rare in clade 1 vs. frequent in clade 2). Apogamy and polyploidy were confirmed as likely mechanisms of hybrid stabilization in clade 2. Despite the large genetic distance between clades 1 and 2, several specimens were observed with gapCp sequences from both; diploid genome size and sexual reproduction indicate maintenance of genetic diversity via introgression or incomplete lineage sorting, rather than ongoing hybridization, in these specimens. Conclusions: The C. minutum species complex is a reticulate network including multiple diploid lineages and their stabilized hybrid crosses. Additional sampling focused on reproductive mode and ploidy level is needed to delimit diploid species and hybrids.	2011	10.3732/ajb.1000484		Plants	Hymenophyllales	Crepidomanes	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (2 genes)	TRUE	
Mason-Gamer, Roberta J.; Burns, Melissa M.; Naum, Marianna	Phylogenetic relationships and reticulation among Asian Elymus (Poaceae) allotetraploids: Analyses of three nuclear gene trees	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	This phylogenetic study focuses on a subset of the species in Elymus-specifically, the endemic Asian tetraploids presumed to combine the St genome from Pseudoroegneria with the Y genome from an unknown donor. The primary goals were to (1) determine whether the St and Y genomes are derived from phylogenetically distinct donors; (2) identify the closest relative, and potentially the likely donor, of the Y genome; and (3) interpret variation among StStYY species in terms of multiple origins and/or introgression. The goals were addressed using phylogenetic analyses of sequences from three low-copy nuclear genes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, beta-amylase, and granule-bound starch synthase I. Data sets include 16 StStYY individuals representing nine species, along with a broad sample of representatives from most of the monogenomic (i.e., non-allopolyploid) genera in the tribe. To briefly summarize the results: (1) the data clearly support an allopolyploid origin for the Asian tetraploids, involving two distinct donors; (2) the Y genome was contributed by a single donor, or multiple closely-related donors; (3) the phylogenetic position of the Elymus Y genome varies among the three trees and its position is not strongly supported, so the identity of the donor remains a mystery; and (4) conflicts among the gene trees with regard to the St-genome sequences suggest introgression involving both Elymus and Pseudoroegneria.

Gobert, V.; Moja, S.; Taberlet, P.; Wink, M.	Heterogeneity of three molecular data partition phylogenies of mints related to M. x piperita (Mentha; Lamiaceae)	PLANT BIOLOGY	Phylogenetic reconstructions with molecular tools are now widely used, thanks to advances in IPCIR and sequencing technologies. The choice of the molecular target still remains a problem because too few comparative data are available. This is particularly true for hybrid taxa, where differential introgression of genome parts leads to incongruity between data sets. We have studied the potential of three data partitions to reconstruct the phylogeny of mints related to M. x piperita. These included nuclear DNA (ITS), chloroplast DNA (non-coding regions tmL intron, intergenic spacers trnL-trnF, and psbA-trnH), and AFLIP and ISSR, markers. The taxonomic sampling was composed of hybrids, diploid and polyploid genomes. Since the genealogy of cultivated mint hybrids is known, they represent a model group to compare the usefulness of various molecular markers for phylogeny inference. Incongruities between ITS, chloroplast DNA, and AFLIP-ISSR phylogenetic trees were recorded, although DNA fingerprinting data were congruent with morphological classification. Evidence of chloroplast capture events was obtained for M. x piperita. Direct sequencing of ITS led to biased results because of the existence of pseuclogenes. Sequencing of cloned ITS further failed to provide evidence of the existence of the two parental copy types for M. x piperita, a sterile hybrid that has had no opportunity for concerted evolution of ITS copies. AFLP-ISSIR data clustered M. x piperita with the parent that had the largest genome. This study sheds light on differential of introgression of different genome regions in mint hybrids.	2006	10.1055/s-2006-924043		Plants	Lamiales	Mentha	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger, AFLP	TRUE

Here we describe ten natural citrus species, using genomic, phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of 60 accessions representing diverse citrus germ plasms, and propose that citrus diversified during the late Miocene epoch through a rapid southeast Asian radiation that correlates with a marked weakening of the monsoons. A second radiation enabled by migration across the Wallace line gave rise to the Australian limes in the early Pliocene epoch. Further identification and analyses of hybrids and admixed genomes provides insights into the genealogy of major commercial cultivars of citrus. Among mandarins and sweet orange, we find an extensive network of relatedness that illuminates the domestication of these groups. Widespread pummelo admixture among these mandarins and its correlation with fruit size and acidity suggests a plausible role of pummelo introgression in the selection of palatable mandarins. This work provides a new evolutionary framework for the genus Citrus.	2018	10.1038/nature25447		Plants	Sapindales	Citrus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees, STRUCTURE	WGS	TRUE	
Stoelting, Kai N.; Nipper, Rick; Lindtke, Dorothea; Caseys, Celine; Waeber, Stephan; Castiglione, Stefano; Lexer, Christian	Genomic scan for single nucleotide polymorphisms reveals patterns of divergence and gene flow between ecologically divergent species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Recent advances in population genomics have triggered great interest in the genomic landscape of divergence in taxa with porous species boundaries. One important obstable of previous studies of this topic was the low genomic coverage achieved. This issue can now be overcome by the use of next generation or short-read DNA-sequencing approaches capable of assaying many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in divergent species. We have scanned the porous genomes of Populus alba and Populus tremula, two ecologically divergent hybridizing forest trees, using >38 000 SNPs assayed by restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Windowed analyses indicate great variation in genetic divergence (e.g. the proportion of fixed SNPs) between species, and these results are unlikely to be strongly biased by genomic features of the Populus trichocarpa reference genome used for SNP calling. Divergence estimates were significantly autocorrelated (P < 0.01; Moran's I up to 0.6) along 11 of 19 chromosomes. Many of these autocorrelations involved low divergence blocks, thus suggesting that allele sharing was caused by recurrent gene flow rather than shared ancestral polymorphism. A conspicuous low divergence block of three megabases was detected on chromosome XIX, recently put forward as an incipient sex chromosome in Populus, and was largely congruent with introgression of mapped microsatellites in two natural hybrid zones (N > 400). Our results help explain the origin of the genomic mosaic seen in these taxa with porous genomes and suggest rampant introgression or extensive among-species conservation of an incipient plant sex chromosome. RAD sequencing holds great promise for detecting patterns of divergence and gene flow in highly divergent hybridizing species.	2013	10.1111/mec.12011		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, INTROGRESS,	RAD (38000 loci), microsattelites	TRUE	
Flatberg, KI; Thingsgaard, K; Sastad, SM	Interploidal gene flow and introgression in bryophytes: Sphagnum girgensohnii x Sphagnum russowii, a case of spontaneous neotriploidy	JOURNAL OF BRYOLOGY	Hybrid zones between female sporophyte-bearing haploid Sphagnum girgensohnii and male allodiploid S. russowii were studied. The existence of hybrids was initially hypothesized based on incidence of conspicuously large sporophytes in S. girgensohnii in the presence of male S. russowii. Measurements of nuclear DNA content, morphology and isozymes provide the first evidence of spontaneous hybridization across ploidal levels in bryophytes. Viable spores from the hybrid capsules yielded triploid protonemata and juvenile gametophores in culture. Isozyme profiles of the triploid gametophores displayed unbalanced heterozygous patterns containing two alleles. As S. russowii is an allodiploid species with S. girgensohnii and S. rubellum as progenitors, isozyme banding patterns of the triploids are interpreted as consisting of a single allele copy from the S. rubellum genome in S. russowii, and two copies of another allele at the same locus inherited from S. girgensohnii. The triploid sporophytes can be considered as F-2 hybrids formed by introgression. The allotriploid gametophores are formed through diplospory or syndiploidy in the hybrid capsules. Comparison of hybrid sporophyte morphology to S. girgensohnii and S. russowii confirmed that hybrid capsules are larger and with an abnormally swollen sporophyte foot. The spore sizes of the hybrid capsules were significantly larger than spores from normal, intraspecific S. girgensohnii capsules. The percentage of germinated spores was <5% in cultures from hybrid sporophytes, which is much lower than in intraspecific sporophytes. The new knowledge opens the way for re-evaluation of polyploid evolution in bryophytes with emphasis on gametic non-reduction, introgression and two-step models of polyploid formation.	2006	10.1179/174328206X90459		Plants	Sphagnales	Sphagnum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, morphology	isozymes	TRUE	
Senerchia, Natacha; Felber, Francois; North, Beatrice; Sarr, Anouk; Guadagnuolo, Roberto; Parisod, Christian	Differential introgression and reorganization of retrotransposons in hybrid zones between wild wheats	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The maintenance of species integrity despite pervasive hybridization is ruled by the interplay between reproductive barriers. Endogenous postzygotic isolation will shape the patterns of introgression in hybrid zones, leading to variable outcomes depending on the genetic mechanism involved. Here, we analysed experimental and natural hybrid populations of Aegilops geniculata and Aegilops triuncialis to examine the genetics of species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Because long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) showing differential evolutionary trajectories are probably to affect hybrid dysgenesis and reproductive isolation between these wild wheat species, we addressed the impact of LTR-RTs in shaping introgression between them. Experimental settings involving artificial sympatry and enforced crossings quantified strong, but incomplete reproductive isolation, and highlighted asymmetrical endogenous postzygotic isolation between the two species. Natural hybrid zones located in the northern Golan Heights were analysed using plastid DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) marking random sequences, and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAP) tracking insertions from six LTR-RT families. This analysis demonstrated asymmetrical introgression and genome reorganization. In comparison with random sequences and quiescent LTR-RTs, those LTR-RTs predicted to be activated following conflicting interactions in hybrids revealed differential introgression across the hybrid zones. As also reported for synthetic F1 hybrids, such LTRRTs were specifically reorganized in the genomes of viable hybrids, confirming that conflicts between selfish LTR-RTs may represent key incompatibilities shaping species boundaries and fostering long-term species integrity in the face of gene flow.	2016	10.1111/mec.13515		Plants	Poales	Aegilops	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines	AFLP, Sanger	TRUE	
Krajmerova, D.; Paule, L.; Zhelev, P.; Volekova, M.; Evtimov, I.; Gagov, V.; Gomory, D.	Natural hybridization in eastern-Mediterranean firs: The case of Abies borisii-regis	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS	The genus Abies is represented in southern Balkans by A. alba, A. cephalonica, and A. borisii-regis. To infer the status of southern-Balkans firs, as well as the extent and patterns of introgression within this taxonomical complex, we analyzed genetic variation patterns of 29 indigenous fir populations in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, and Calabria using a combination of maternally and biparentally inherited markers. Three mitochondrial lineages were observed, one comprising Calabrian populations and two distributed in the Balkans, coinciding with A. alba and A. cephalonica. The boundary between lineages is sharp; only two populations containing a mixture of haplotypes were found. Bayesian analysis of population structure based on seven nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci revealed the existence of two clusters whose proportions exhibited a latitudinal cline with a width of 2.3 degrees (approximate to 255 km). Populations in the center of the latitudinal cline exhibit the most symmetrical, the flattest, and the broadest distributions of cluster proportions within individual tree genomes. A neighbor-net network reflects the cline resulting from the Bayesiananalysis. The observed variation patterns are not consistent with the hypothesis of A. borisii-regis as a monophyletic taxon or a stabilized hybridogenous species resulted from ancient hybridization; the taxon rather is a product of recent introgression.	2016	10.1080/11263504.2015.1011723		Plants	Pinales	Abies	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines, trees	Sanger (5 genes)	TRUE	
Aeschbacher, Simon; Selby, Jessica P.; Willis, John H.; Coop, Graham	Population-genomic inference of the strength and timing of selection against gene flow	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	The interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density (i.e., the selection coefficient per base pair) is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared with what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.	2017	10.1073/pnas.1616755114		Plants	Lamiales	Mimulus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	demography	WGS	TRUE	
Kolarcik, Vladislav; Zozomova-Lihova, Judita; Ducar, Erik; Martonfi, Pavol	Evolutionary significance of hybridization in Onosma (Boraginaceae): analyses of stabilized hemisexual odd polyploids and recent sterile hybrids	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Interspecific hybridization is an important evolutionary force promoting plant speciation. In the genus Onosma, one of three main evolutionary lineages presumably evolved by hybrid speciation. The assumed hybrid lineage (Heterotricha) consists of two species complexes with bimodal karyotypes containing different numbers of large (L) and small (S) chromosomes, the tetraploid Onosma pseudoarenaria (2n = 12 L + 14S) and the triploid Onosma arenaria (2n = 12 L + 8S). The latter represents a rare case of hemisexual, asymmetrically compensating allopolyploids. Representatives of the other two lineages of the genus, Haplotricha (2n = 12 L) and Asterotricha (2n = 14S), have been considered to be the ancestral taxa of O. pseudoarenaria and O. arenaria, although this has yet to be investigated critically. In the present study, we examined genetic [amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) , and chloroplast (cp)DNA)], reproductive (pollen viability and seed production) and cytogenetic (chromosome counts, genome size assessment) patterns to resolve the hypothesized allopolyploid formations in the Heterotricha group, single or polytopic allopolyploid origins, as well as ongoing interspecific gene flow as one piece of evidence for understanding past hybrid speciation events in the genus. Discordant patterns in maternally inherited cpDNA (Heterotricha accessions bearing the haplotypes related to asterotrichous species) and the nuclear ITS and AFLP markers (Heterotricha clustering with haplotrichous Onosma fastigiata), as well as karyological features, support the hybrid origin of the stabilized Heterotricha lineage. Genetic variation that is both large and geographically correlated indicates multiple origins of Heterotricha allopolyploids or, less likely, a single origin with recurring introgression from the progenitor species. The nuclear markers and cytogenetic features also provide evidence for the ongoing hybridization between O. arenaria and Onosma echioides (2n = 14S), which gives rise to sterile triploids of 2n = 6 L + 15S. We contrast the two cases of triploids with LLS (hemisexual O. arenaria from the stabilized Heterotricha lineage) and LSS (recent sterile hybrids) karyotypes, which could help to understand the mechanisms ensuring the establishment and reproductive fitness of the odd allopolyploids in Onosma.

Vega, Yesenia; Marques, Isabel; Castro, Silvia; Loureiro, Joao	Outcomes of Extensive Hybridization and Introgression in Epidendrum (Orchidaceae): Can We Rely on Species Boundaries?	PLOS ONE	Hybridization has the potential to contribute to phenotypic and genetic variation and can be a major evolutionary mechanism. However, when hybridization is extensive it can also lead to the blurring of species boundaries and the emergence of cryptic species (i.e., two or more species not distinguishable morphologically). In this study, we address this hypothesis in Epidendrum, the largest Neotropical genus of orchids where hybridization is apparently so common that it may explain the high levels of morphological diversity found. Nonetheless, this hypothesis is mostly based on the intermediacy of morphological characters and intermediacy by itself is not a proof of hybridization. Therefore, in this study, we first assessed the existence of hybrids using cpDNA and AFLP data gathered from a large-scale sampling comprising 1038 plants of three species of Epidendrum (E. calanthum, E. cochlidium and E. schistochilum). Subsequently, a Bayesian assignment of individuals into different genetic classes (pure species, F1, F2 or backcross generations) revealed that hybrid genotypes were prevalent in all sympatric populations. In most cases, parental species were not assigned as pure individuals, rather consisting in backcrossed genotypes or F1 hybrids. We also found that reproductive barriers are apparently very weak in Epidendrum because the three species largely overlapped in their flowering periods and interspecific crosses always produced viable seeds. Further, hybridization contributed to enhance floral variability, genome size and reproductive success since we found that these traits were always higher in hybrid classes (F1, F2 and backcrosses) than in pure parental species, and offer an explanation for the blurring of species boundaries in this genus of orchids. We hypothesize that these natural hybrids possess an evolutionary advantage, which may explain the high rates of cryptic species observed in this genus.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0080662		Plants	Asparagales	Epidendrum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	NEWHYBRIDS, morphology	Sanger, AFLP	TRUE	
De La Torre, Amanda R.; Wang, Tongli; Jaquish, Barry; Aitken, Sally N.	Adaptation and exogenous selection in a Picea glauca x Picea engelmannii hybrid zone: implications for forest management under climate change	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	The nature of selection responsible for the maintenance of the economically and ecologically important Picea glaucaxPicea engelmannii hybrid zone was investigated. Genomic, phenotypic and climatic data were used to test assumptions of hybrid zone maintenance and to model future scenarios under climate change. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 86 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms were combined with long-term quantitative data on growth and survival (over 20yr), as well as one-time assessments of bud burst and bud set phenology, and cold hardiness traits. A total of 15498 individuals were phenotyped for growth and survival. Our results suggest that the P.glaucaxP.engelmannii hybrid zone is maintained by local adaptation to growing season length and snowpack (exogenous selection). Hybrids appeared to be fitter than pure species in intermediate environments, which fits expectations of the bounded hybrid superiority model of hybrid zone maintenance. Adaptive introgression from parental species has probably contributed to increased hybrid fitness in intermediate habitats. While P.engelmannii ancestry is higher than P.glauca ancestry in hybrid populations, on average, selective breeding in managed hybrid populations is shifting genomic composition towards P.glauca, potentially pre-adapting managed populations to warmer climates.	2014	10.1111/nph.12540		Plants	Pinales	Picea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	NEWHYBRIDS	microarray (770 loci)	TRUE

Pseudolysimachium (Plantaginaceae)	SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	Veronica subgen. Pseudolysimachium constitutes a group of about 28 species across northern Eurasia, many of them with considerable intraspecific morphological variation. This intraspecific variation may be due to large geographical distribution area, wide ecological amplitude, or widespread hybridization and polyploidization. Several recent studies using molecular data have shown that hybridization as an explanation for generating evolutionary novelties and high intraspecific variation may be more common than previously thought. Here we investigate the importance of hybridization in generating morphological variation and blurring species boundaries in V. subgen. Pseudolysimachium using analyses of cpDNA sequences from 139 individuals from 18 species and ten putative hybrids, and pyrosequenced ITS1 nrDNA sequences from 37 individuals from 16 species and four putative hybrids. In addition, we estimated ploidy levels for 42 individuals of ten species and five putative hybrids using flow cytometry. Analyses of cpDNA did not resolve phylogenetic structure (most of the species were polyphyletic). Our second approach, pyrosequencing of ITS1, generated up to nine different unique sequences per individual and phylogenetic analyses of the dataset resolved some basal nodes but, again, species were often non-monophyletic. The results are most compatible with a scenario of an East Asian origin and repeated spread across Pleistocene Eurasian steppes, known as important plant diversification center, with frequent interspecific hybridization. We compare the applicability of these molecular regions for resolving hybridizing species complexes and specifically address hypotheses of hybrid origins for several species within the subgenus. However, any population genetic, phylogeographic or other analysis of evolutionary questions in one species alone would be futile without considering introgression from related species.	2016	10.1600/036364416X690697		Plants	Lamiales	Veronica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger	TRUE	
Badr, A.; El-Shazly, H. H.; Mekki, L.	Genetic diversity in white clover and its progenitors as revealed by DNA fingerprinting	BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM	The genetic diversity and ancestral relationships of a number of Trifolium species was revealed by using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Both markers produced few species-specific markers. Using distance and parsimony methods, in NTSYS-pc and PAUP software programs, we clearly differentiated the accessions of white clover from other closely related progenitors. The phylogenetic trees, produced by PAUP, also reinforced the close affinity of T. nigrescens and the allopolyploid white clover in support of former views that this diploid species could have been the donor of one of two genomes of the allotetraploid T. repens. In addition, the dendrograms, produced by NTSYS-pc, also indicated close affinity of T. nigrescens and T. occidentale to the accessions of T. repens. These data is congruent with karyological and phylogenetic affinities between the white clover and T. occidentale. The relationships between the examined accessions, in the T. repens gene pool, may be regarded to indicate the presence of shared alleles between T. repens, T. occidentale and T. uniflorum. Further, T. occidentale showed close phylogenetic relations to T. pallescens.	2012	10.1007/s10535-012-0088-0		Plants	Fabales	Trifolium	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	RAPD	TRUE	
Certner, Martin; Kolar, Filip; Schoenswetter, Peter; Frajman, Bozo	Does hybridization with a widespread congener threaten the long-term persistence of the Eastern Alpine rare local endemic Knautia carinthiaca?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Interspecific hybridization, especially when regularly followed by backcrossing (i.e., introgressive hybridization), conveys a substantial risk for many endangered organisms. This is particularly true for narrow endemics occurring within distributional ranges of widespread congeners. An excellent example is provided by the plant genus Knautia (Caprifoliaceae): Locally endemic K.carinthiaca is reported from two isolated populations in southern Austria situated within an area predominantly occupied by widespread K.arvensis. While K.carinthiaca usually inhabits low-competition communities on rocky outcrops, K.arvensis occurs mainly in dry to mesic managed grasslands, yet both species can coexist in marginal environments and were suspected to hybridize. Flow cytometry revealed that diploid K.carinthiaca only occurs at its locus classicus, whereas the second locality is inhabited by the morphologically similar but tetraploid K.norica. In the, therefore, single population of K.carinthiaca, flow cytometry and AFLP fingerprinting showed signs of introgressive hybridization with diploid K.arvensis. Hybridization patterns were also reflected in intermediate habitat preferences and morphology of the hybrids. Environmental barriers to gene flow seem to prevent genetic erosion of K.carinthiaca individuals from the core ecological niches, restricting most introgressed individuals to peripheral habitats. Efficient conservation of K.carinthiaca will require strict protection of its habitat and ban on forest clear cuts in a buffer zone to prevent invasion of K.arvensis. We demonstrate the large potential of multidisciplinary approaches combining molecular, cytometric, and ecological tools for a reliable inventory and threat assessment of rare species.	2015	10.1002/ece3.1686		Plants	Dipsacales	Knautia	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, NEWHYBRIDS, STRUCTURE	AFLP	TRUE	
Balao, Francisco; Casimiro-Soriguer, Ramon; Luis Garcia-Castano, Juan; Terrab, Anass; Talavera, Salvador	Big thistle eats the little thistle: does unidirectional introgressive hybridization endanger the conservation of Onopordum hinojense?	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	Hybridization is known to have a creative role in plant evolution. However, it can also have negative effects on parental species. Onopordum is a large genus whose species frequently hybridize. In the Southwest Iberian Peninsula, the rare O.hinojense co-occurs with the widely distributed O.nervosum, and hybrids between these two taxa have been described as O.xonubense. In this study we determine the extinction risk in a hybrid zone, both for hybrids and parentals, using analyses of morphological and cytogenetic traits as well as genetic markers and demographic models. To investigate the introgression process we used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, Bayesian analyses and genome scan methods. Morphology, genome size and molecular markers confirmed homoploid hybridization and also indicated unidirectional backcrossing of F-1 hybrids with O.nervosum, which is likely to swamp O.hinojense, the parental with lower pollen size and a very low fruit set (8%). Genome scan methods revealed several loci significantly deviating from neutrality. Finally, our demographic modeling indicated that the higher fitness of O.nervosum threats the survival of O.hinojense by demographic swamping. Our study provides strong new evidence for a scenario of rapid extinction by unidirectional introgression and demographic swamping. The multifaceted approach used here sheds new light on the role of introgression in plant extinctions.	2015	10.1111/nph.13156		Plants	Asterales	Onopordum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, NEWHYBRIDS, STRUCTURE	AFLP	TRUE	
Grassi, F; Labra, M; Minuto, L; Casazza, G; Sala, F	Natural hybridization in Saxifraga callosa Sm.	PLANT BIOLOGY	Saxifrago callosa Sm. is an evergreen perennial species distributed from Eastern Spain, through the Western Alps and the Apennines, to southern Italy. The existence of high morphological variation within different subspecies indicates that phenotypic characters are useful but not sufficient taxonomic tools. Indeed, available morphological data already suggested that S. callosa subentity lantoscana may be an outcross between S. callosa and S. cochlearis. In this work, by analyzing ITS (internal Transcribed Sequences), AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms), and cpDNA (chloroplast DNA) markers, a comprehensive study of the genomic relationships among S. callosa and related species has been carried out. The sequence of the ITS region of S. callosa subentity lantoscana gave no conclusive results on the taxonomy status of S. callosa subentity lantoscana. On the other hand, the use of the "NewHybrids" software to analyze an AFLP data-set (208 polymorphic amplified fragments) supported a significant posterior probability that S. callosa subentity lantoscana individuals are natural hybrids between S. callosa and S. cochlearis. The level of introgression of genes from alien genomes was confirmed by a simpler and quick methodology that analyze length variation in cpDNA sequences.	2006	10.1055/s-2005-873047		Plants	Saxifragales	Saxifraga	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, trees, NEWHYBRIDS	AFLP	TRUE

Principal component analysis (PCA) and pairwise estimates of F-st supported that the inbred accessions represented seven sub-populations including processing, large-fruited fresh market, large-fruited vintage, cultivated cherry, landrace, wild cherry, and S. pimpinellifolium. Further divisions were found within both the contemporary processing and fresh market sub-populations. These sub-populations showed higher levels of genetic diversity relative to the vintage sub-population. The array provided a large number of polymorphic SNP markers across each sub-population, ranging from 3,159 in the vintage accessions to 6,234 in the cultivated cherry accessions. Visualization of minor allele frequency revealed regions of the genome that distinguished three representative sub-populations of cultivated tomato (processing, fresh market, and vintage), particularly on chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11. The PCA loadings and F-st outlier analysis between these three sub-populations identified a large number of candidate loci under positive selection on chromosomes 4, 5, and 11. The extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) was examined within each chromosome for these sub-populations. LD decay varied between chromosomes and sub-populations, with large differences reflective of breeding history. For example, on chromosome 11, decay occurred over 0.8 cM for processing accessions and over 19.7 cM for fresh market accessions. The observed SNP variation and LD decay suggest that different patterns of genetic variation in cultivated tomato are due to introgression from wild species and selection for market specialization.	2012	10.1371/journal.pone.0045520		Plants	Solanales	Solanum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, sequence similarity	microarray (7700 loci)	TRUE	
Allender, Charlotte J.; King, Graham J.	Origins of the amphiploid species Brassica napus L. investigated by chloroplast and nuclear molecular markers	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: The amphiploid species Brassica napus (oilseed rape, Canola) is a globally important oil crop yielding food, biofuels and industrial compounds such as lubricants and surfactants. Identification of the likely ancestors of each of the two genomes (designated A and C) found in B. napus would facilitate incorporation of novel alleles from the wider Brassica genepool in oilseed rape crop genetic improvement programmes. Knowledge of the closest extant relatives of the genotypes involved in the initial formation of B. napus would also allow further investigation of the genetic factors required for the formation of a stable amphiploid and permit the more efficient creation of fully fertile re-synthesised B. napus. We have used a combination of chloroplast and nuclear genetic markers to investigate the closest extant relatives of the original maternal progenitors of B. napus. This was based on a comprehensive sampling of the relevant genepools, including 83 accessions of A genome B. rapa L. (both wild and cultivated types), 94 accessions of B. napus and 181 accessions of C genome wild and cultivated B. oleracea L. and related species. Results: Three chloroplast haplotypes occurred in B. napus. The most prevalent haplotype (found in 79% of accessions) was not present within the C genome accessions but was found at low frequencies in B. rapa. Chloroplast haplotypes characteristic of B. napus were found in a small number of wild and weedy B. rapa populations, and also in two accessions of cultivated B. rapa 'brocoletto'. Whilst introgression of the B. napus chloroplast type in the wild and weedy B. rapa populations has been proposed by other studies, the presence of this haplotype within the two brocoletto accessions is unexplained. Conclusions: The distribution of chloroplast haplotypes eliminate any of the C genome species as being the maternal ancestor of the majority of the B. napus accessions. The presence of multiple chloroplast haplotypes in B. napus and B. rapa accessions was not correlated with nuclear genetic diversity as determined by AFLPs, indicating that such accessions do not represent recent hybrids. Whilst some chloroplast diversity observed within B. napus can be explained by introgression from inter-specific crosses made during crop improvement programmes, there is evidence that the original hybridisation event resulting in to B. napus occurred on more than one occasion, and involved different maternal genotypes.	2010	10.1186/1471-2229-10-54		Plants	Brassicales	Brassica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, trees	Sanger, AFLP	TRUE	
Van Droogenbroeck, B; Kyndt, T; Romeijn-Peeters, E; Van Thuyne, W; Goetghebeur, P; Romero-Motochi, JP; Gheysen, G	Evidence of natural hybridization and introgression between Vasconcellea species (Caricaceae) from southern Ecuador revealed by chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims Vasconcellea x heilbornii is believed to be of natural hybrid origin between V. cundinamarcensis and V. stipulata, and is often difficult to discriminate from V. stipulata on morphological grounds. The aim of this paper is to examine individuals of these three taxa and of individuals from the closely related species V. parviflora and V. weberbaueri, which all inhabit a hybrid zone in southern Ecuador. Methods Molecular data from mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear DNA from 61 individuals were analysed. Key Results Molecular analysis confirmed occasional contemporary hybridization between V. stipulata, V. cundinamarcensis and V. x heilbornii and suggested the possible involvement of V. weberbaueri in the origin of V. x heilbornii. In addition, the molecular data indicated unidirectional introgression of the V. cundinamarcensis nuclear genome into that of V. stipulata. Several of the individuals examined with morphology similar to that of V. stipulata had genetic traces of hybridization with V. cundinamarcensis, which only seems to act as pollen donor in interspecific hybridization events. Molecular analyses also strongly suggested that most of the V. x heilbornii individuals are not F-1 hybrids but instead are progeny of repeated backcrosses with V. stipulata. Conclusions The results of the present study point to the need for re-evaluation of natural populations of V. stipulata and V. x heilbornii. In general, this analysis demonstrates the complex patterns of genetic and morphological diversity found in natural plant hybrid zones.	2006	10.1093/aob/mcl038		Plants	Brassicales	Vasconcellea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, trees, sequence similarity	AFLP (234 loci)	TRUE	
Trneny, Oldrich; Brus, Jan; Hradilova, Iveta; Rathore, Abhishek; Das, Roma R.; Kopecky, Pavel; Coyne, Clarice J.; Reeves, Patrick; Richards, Christopher; Smykal, Petr	Molecular Evidence for Two Domestication Events in the Pea Crop	GENES	Pea, one of the founder crops from the Near East, has two wild species: Pisum sativum subsp. elatius, with a wide distribution centered in the Mediterranean, and P. fulvum, which is restricted to Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Jordan. Using genome wide analysis of 11,343 polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a set of wild P. elatius (134) and P. fulvum (20) and 74 domesticated accessions (64 P. sativum landraces and 10 P. abyssinicum), we demonstrated that domesticated P. sativum and the Ethiopian pea (P. abyssinicum) were derived from different P. elatius genepools. Therefore, pea has at least two domestication events. The analysis does not support a hybrid origin of P. abyssinicum, which was likely introduced into Ethiopia and Yemen followed by eco-geographic adaptation. Both P. sativum and P. abyssinicum share traits that are typical of domestication, such as non-dormant seeds. Non-dormant seeds were also found in several wild P. elatius accessions which could be the result of crop to wild introgression or natural variation that may have been present during pea domestication. A sub-group of P. elatius overlaps with P. sativum landraces. This may be a consequence of bidirectional gene-flow or may suggest that this group of P. elatius is the closest extant wild relative of P. sativum.	2018	10.3390/genes9110535		Plants	Brassicales	Brassica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	PCA, trees	AFLP (102 loci)	TRUE	
Thomson, Ashley M.; Dick, Christopher W.; Pascoini, Ana L.; Dayanandan, Selvadurai	Despite introgressive hybridization, North American birches (Betula spp.) maintain strong differentiation at nuclear microsatellite loci	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	Extensive chloroplast introgression has been documented in polyploid Betula species of eastern North America. However, the extent to which the nuclear genomes of these species are differentiated is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated genetic differentiation among largely sympatric Betula papyrifera, B. alleghaniensis, and B. lenta using nuclear microsatellite markers. Principal components analysis (PCA) and analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) were used to evaluate genetic differentiation. Bayesian model-based clustering was used to identify putatively admixed individuals. Despite a high incidence of allele sharing, all of the species were significantly differentiated even within zones of sympatry. A number of individuals were identified as possibly admixed between B. papyrifera and B. alleghaniensis and between B. alleghaniensis and B. lenta. Admixture estimates between B. alleghaniensis and B. papyrifera increased significantly moving northward into the sympatric zone, suggesting the occurrence of hybridization in previously glaciated habitats. In contrast, admixture proportions of B. papyrifera and B. alleghaniensis did not show a significant geographic trend, which points to recent ancestry as the likely cause of allele sharing between these two species. We suggest that allele sharing of B. papyrifera and B. alleghaniensis results from a combination of ongoing gene flow and historic introgression via pollen swamping during northward colonization into post-glacial environments.	2015	10.1007/s11295-015-0922-6		Plants	Fagales	Betula	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines	AFLP	TRUE	
Gernandt, David S.; Hernandez-Leon, Sergio; Salgado-Hernandez, Esmeralda; Perez de la Rosa, Jorge A.	Phylogenetic Relationships of Pinus Subsection Ponderosae Inferred from Rapidly Evolving cpDNA Regions	SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	Pinus subsection Ponderosae includes approximately 17 tree species distributed from western Canada to Nicaragua. We inferred phylogenetic relationships of multiple accessions for all widely recognized species from 3.7 kb of cpDNA sequence (matK, trnD-trnY-trnE spacer, chlN-ycf1 spacer, and ycf1). The sister relationship between subsections Ponderosae and Australes was corroborated with high branch support, and several clades, most with lower branch support, were identified within subsection Ponderosae. Pinus jeffreyi was sister to P. coulteri, P. sabiniana, and P. torreyana. Californian accessions of P. ponderosa and P. washoensis occurred in a clade separate from P. arizonica and P. scopulorum from the southwestern United States. Western Mexican species P. cooperi and P. durangensis had cpDNA sequences identical to one or more accessions of P. arizonica and P. scopulorum, and together these taxa were closely related to clades of P. engelntannii-P. devoniana (Mexico) and P. douglasiana-P. yecorensis-P. maximinoi (western Mexico to Guatemala). A well supported clade of taxa from Mexico and Central America included P. pseudostrobus, P. montezumae, P. hartwegii, P. maximinoi (one of three accessions), P. nubicola, and P. donnell-smithii. Chloroplast DNA sequences were nonmonophyletic for most species, although the degree of support varied.	2009	10.1600/036364409789271290		Plants	Pinales	Pinus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger (5 genes)	TRUE	
Zhang, Yu-Xiao; Zeng, Chun-Xia; Li, De-Zhu	Complex evolution in Arundinarieae (Poaceae: Bambusoideae): Incongruence between plastid and nuclear GBSSI gene phylogenies	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	The monophyly of tribe Arundinarieae (the temperate woody bamboos) has been unequivocally recovered in previous molecular phylogenetic studies. In a recent phylogenetic study, 10 major lineages in Arundinarieae were resolved based on eight non-coding plastid regions, which conflicted significantly with morphological classifications both at the subtribal and generic levels. Nevertheless, relationships among and within the 10 lineages remain unclear. In order to further unravel the evolutionary history of Arundinarieae, we used the nuclear GBSSI gene sequences along with those of eight plastid regions for phylogenetic reconstruction, with an emphasis on Chinese species. The results of the plastid analyses agreed with previous studies, whereas 13 primary clades revealed in the GBSSI phylogeny were better resolved at the generic level than the plastid phylogeny. Our analyses also revealed many inconsistencies between the plastid DNA and the nuclear GBSSI trees. These results implied that the nuclear genome and the plastid genome had different evolutionary trajectories. The patterns of incongruence suggested that lack of informative characters, incomplete lineage sorting, and/or hybridization (introgression) could be the causes. Seven putative hybrid species were hypothesized, four of which are discussed in detail on the basis of topological incongruence, chromosome numbers, morphology, and distribution patterns, and those taxa probably resulted from homoploid hybrid speciation. Overall, our study indicates that the tribe Arundinarieae has undergone a complex evolution. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Schneider, Harald; Navarro-Gomez, Adriana; Russell, Stephen J.; Ansell, Stephen; Grundmann, Michal; Vogel, Johannes	Exploring the utility of three nuclear regions to reconstruct reticulate evolution in the fern genus Asplenium	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Three nuclear regions nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and intron regions of two nuclear low-copy genesgapCp, and pgiC, in combination with one chloroplast genome region were employed to explore patterns of reticulate evolution in the fern genus Asplenium. This is the one of the first studies using DNA sequences of multiple nuclear markers in ferns. All three nuclear markers amplified well with PCR and several copies were recovered by cloning PCR products. All three nuclear regions showed congruent results by recovering the neo-allotetraploid Asplenium adulterinum as the hybrid of diploid A. trichomanes and diploid A. viride. Conflicting results were obtained for several nodes. First, gapCp did not discriminate between A. aethiopicum and A. praegracile whereas the other markers recovered these two taxa as distinct. Conflicts among gene-trees were found in respect to A. monanthes, chloroplast and pgiC suggested a sister relationship of A. monanthes and A. trichomanes but gapCp and nrITS nested A. monanthes within A. normale. Our results confirm: (i) the usefulness of several nuclear regions, in particular gapCp and pgiC, to unravel reticulate evolution in ferns and species differentiation and (ii) highlights the need to employ more than one nuclear region to obtain reliable hypotheses on reticulate events versus incomplete lineage sorting. Especially, if one assumes that the reticulation event might have occurred in the more distant past. Considering the expected high frequency of reticulate evolution in ferns, the establishment of robust and informative nuclear genomic markers is critical to achieve further progress in our efforts to elucidate fern evolution.	2013	10.1111/j.1759-6831.2012.00226.x		Plants	Polypodiales	Asplenium	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE	
Moner, Ali M.; Furtado, Agnelo; Chivers, Ian; Fox, Glen; Crayn, Darren; Henry, Robert J.	Diversity and evolution of rice progenitors in Australia	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	In the thousands of years of rice domestication in Asia, many useful genes have been lost from the gene pool. Wild rice is a key source of diversity for domesticated rice. Genome sequencing has suggested that the wild rice populations in northern Australia may include novel taxa, within the AA genome group of close (interfertile) wild relatives of domesticated rice that have evolved independently due to geographic separation and been isolated from the loss of diversity associated with gene flow from the large populations of domesticated rice in Asia. Australian wild rice was collected from 27 sites from Townsville to the northern tip of Cape York. Whole chloroplast genome sequences and 4,555 nuclear gene sequences (more than 8Mbp) were used to explore genetic relationships between these populations and other wild and domesticated rices. Analysis of the chloroplast and nuclear data showed very clear evidence of distinctness from other AA genome Oryza species with significant divergence between Australian populations. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the Australian populations represent the earliest-branching AA genome lineages and may be critical resources for global rice food security. Nuclear genome analysis demonstrated that the diverse O.meridionalis populations were sister to all other AA genome taxa while the Australian O.rufipogon-like populations were associated with the clade that included domesticated rice. Populations of apparent hybrids between the taxa were also identified suggesting ongoing dynamic evolution of wild rice in Australia. These introgressions model events similar to those likely to have been involved in the domestication of rice.	2018	10.1002/ece3.3989		Plants	Poales	Oryza	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	WGS	TRUE	
Morales-Briones, Diego F.; Liston, Aaron; Tank, David C.	Phylogenomic analyses reveal a deep history of hybridization and polyploidy in the Neotropical genus Lachemilla (Rosaceae)	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	Hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, and phylogenetic error produce similar incongruence patterns, representing a great challenge for phylogenetic reconstruction. Here, we use sequence capture data and multiple species tree and species network approaches to resolve the backbone phylogeny of the Neotropical genus Lachemilla, while distinguishing among sources of incongruence. We used 396 nuclear loci and nearly complete plastome sequences from 27 species to clarify the relationships among the major groups of Lachemilla, and explored multiple sources of conflict between gene trees and species trees inferred with a plurality of approaches. All phylogenetic methods recovered the four major groups previously proposed for Lachemilla, but species tree methods recovered different topologies for relationships between these four clades. Species network analyses revealed that one major clade, Orbiculate, is likely of ancient hybrid origin, representing one of the main sources of incongruence among the species trees. Additionally, we found evidence for a potential whole genome duplication event shared by Lachemilla and allied genera. Lachemilla shows clear evidence of ancient and recent hybridization throughout the evolutionary history of the group. Also, we show the necessity to use phylogenetic network approaches that can simultaneously accommodate incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow when studying groups that show patterns of reticulation.	2018	10.1111/nph.15099		Plants	Rosales	Lachemilla	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	demographic simulations	transcriptome	TRUE	
Rai, Bhuwan; Takahashi, Hiroko; Kato, Kenji; Sato, Yo-ichiro; Nakamura, Ikuo	Single-copy nuclear PolA1 gene sheds light on the origin of S genome with relationships to B and G genomes of polyploid wheat species	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	PolA1, a single-copy nuclear gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I, comprises highly polymorphic intron 19 and nucleotide tag (Ntag) sequences. We analyzed these sequences in 42 accessions, which differed in ploidy, of Triticum-Aegilops and Hordeum species. The lengths of the intron 19 sequences were ca. 110 bp long in Triticum-Aegilops species, except in four Sitopsis species, Ae. longissima, Ae. searsii, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. speltoides, which had introns similar in length to those of Hordeum species, i.e., ca. 240 bp long. Phylogenetic analyses of the Ntag sequences showed that the four Sitopsis and remaining Triticum-Aegilops species were classified into two discrete Hordeum and Triticum clades, respectively. The A and D genome-specific Ntag sequences of polyploid wheats were highly homologous with those of T. urartu and Ae. tauschii, respectively. In Ae. bicornis, another Sitopsis species, two accessions had the short intron 19 and Triticum-type Ntag sequence, which were highly homologous with those of the B genome in polyploid wheats, whereas one accession contained the long intron 19 and Hordeum-type Ntag sequences. In contrast, partial sequence analyses revealed that the three accessions of Ae. bicornis shared highly homology to single-copy DMC1 and EF-G genes. The discrepancy between these results indicates that the Sitopsis species were probably established by hybrid speciation including ancient introgressive hybridization between progenitors of Triticum-Aegilops and Hordeum. Although many researchers have proposed Ae. speltoides as a candidate for the B genome donor, our data suggest the existence of diploid B genome species in the past that were responsible for the origin of both polyploid wheats and Sitopsis species, including Ae. speltoides.	2012	10.1007/s10722-012-9793-y		Plants	Poales	Triticum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE	
Culumber, C. Mae; Larson, Steven R.; Jones, Thomas A.; Jensen, Kevin B.	Wide-Scale Population Sampling Identifies Three Phylogeographic Races of Basin Wildrye and Low-Level Genetic Admixture with Creeping Wildrye	CROP SCIENCE	Basin wildrye [Leymus cinereus (Scribn. & Merr.) A. Love] and creeping wildrye [Leymus triticoides (Buckley) Pilg.] are outcrossing perennial grasses native to western North America. These divergent species are generally adapted to different habitats but can form fertile hybrids. Cultivars of both species are used in agriculture and conservation, but little is known about genetic diversity and gene flow among these species. Therefore, multilocus amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotypes and chloroplast DNA sequences were evaluated from 536 L. cinereus and 43 L. triticoides plants from 224 locations of western United States and Canada. Bayesian-cluster analysis detected three L. cinereus races corresponding to the Columbia, Rocky Mountain, and Great Basin regions. Possible admixture between species was detected in specific areas, but only 2.2% of the plants showed more than 10% introgression. The Columbia and Great Basin races were predominantly octoploid whereas most of the Rocky Mountain accessions were tetraploid. Approximately 36 and 7% of the AFLP variation was apportioned among species and races, respectively, but no discrete marker differences were detected among these groups. Although species can be distinguished using a relatively small set of AFLP markers showing divergent allele frequencies, at least 30 markers were needed to classify plants by race. Approximately 8 and 11% of the chloroplast DNA sequence variation was apportioned among species and races, but these markers were not practically useful for species or race identification.	2013	10.2135/cropsci2012.06.0396		Plants	Poales	Leymus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	AFLP, Sanger	TRUE	
Maschinski, Joyce; Sirkin, Eileen; Fant, Jeremie	Using genetic and morphological analysis to distinguish endangered taxa from their hybrids with the cultivated exotic pest plant Lantana strigocamara (syn: Lantana camara)	CONSERVATION GENETICS	Because highly invasive species can rapidly assimilate rare taxa, we questioned whether two Florida endangered Lantana depressa varieties existed 21 years after Sanders documented their widespread hybridization with exotic Lantana strigocamara, and whether morphological traits could accurately discriminate genetic individuals. Stepwise discriminant analysis of morphological characters discriminated the three taxa, correctly classifying 98, 91, 89% of L. strigocamara, L. depressa var. depressa, and var. floridana. Hybrids blurred taxonomic distinctions of varieties and reduced classification accuracy by 7-17%. Species-specific Random Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) confirmed hybridization has occurred. Intersimple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) fingerprints analyzed with STRUCTURE identified three groups indicating introgression. Morphological traits significantly, but weakly correlated with q ratios (P = 0.0001; r(2) = 0.45). Although L. strigocamara introgression is widespread and ongoing, wild populations contain individuals that are predominantly L. depressa genome, supporting actions to remove adventive L. strigocamara, prevent its sale, and promote sales of genetically confirmed natives.	2010	10.1007/s10592-009-0035-6		Plants	Lamiales	Lantana	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	RFLP	TRUE	
Natcheva, Rayna; Cronberg, Nils	Recombination and introgression of nuclear and chloroplast genomes between the peat mosses, Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum quinquefarium	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Haploid hybrid gametophytes are often present at low frequencies in sympatric populations of Sphagnum capillifolium and Sphagnum quinquefarium. We used intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the trnL(UAA) intron of the chloroplast genome to reveal the nuclear and chloroplast composition of mature hybrid gametophytes from natural populations and of gametophytes derived from spores of hybrid sporophytes collected in nature. Asymmetrical nuclear inheritance was found in the progeny of the hybrid sporophytes, indicating that only spores with a low level of recombination of parental genomes were viable. A similarly skewed nuclear composition was found among the naturally occurring hybrid gametophytes. All hybrid genomes contained a larger proportion of S. capillifolium ISSR markers, combined with only two to five S. quinquefarium markers together with a chloroplast haplotype derived from S. quinquefarium. In this way, a pattern resembling introgression is created within a single generation. Some individuals possessed nuclear genomes typical for S. capillifolium in combination with the chloroplast haplotype of S. quinquefarium, possibly indicating backcrossing. Our results indicate that hybridization between S. capillifolium and S. quinquefarium is relatively common, but the resistance of large parts of the genome against heterospecific genes maintains the genetic distinctness of the species. Further evolutionary and phylogenetic consequences of restricted interspecific gene exchange are discussed.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03163.x		Plants	Sphagnales	Sphagnum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	Sanger (5 loci)	TRUE	
Stenoien, H. K.; Shaw, A. J.; Stengrundet, K.; Flatberg, K. I.	The narrow endemic Norwegian peat moss Sphagnum troendelagicum originated before the last glacial maximum	HEREDITY	It is commonly found that individual hybrid, polyploid species originate recurrently and that many polyploid species originated relatively recently. It has been previously hypothesized that the extremely rare allopolyploid peat moss Sphagnum troendelagicum has originated multiple times, possibly after the last glacial maximum in Scandinavia. This conclusion was based on low linkage disequilibrium in anonymous genetic markers within natural populations, in which sexual reproduction has never been observed. Here we employ microsatellite markers and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)-encoded trnG sequence data to test hypotheses concerning the origin and evolution of this species. We find that S. tenellum is the maternal progenitor and S. balticum is the paternal progenitor of S. troendelagicum. Using various Bayesian approaches, we estimate that S. troendelagicum originated before the Holocene but not before c. 80 000 years ago (median expected time since speciation 40 000 years before present). The observed lack of complete linkage disequilibrium in the genome of this species suggests cryptic sexual reproduction and recombination. Several lines of evidence suggest multiple origins for S. troendelagicum, but a single origin is supported by approximate Bayesian computation analyses. We hypothesize that S. troendelagicum originated in a peat-dominated refugium before last glacial maximum, and subsequently immigrated to central Norway by means of spore flow during the last thousands of years.

Furches, M. Steven; Small, Randall L.; Furches, Anna	HYBRIDIZATION LEADS TO INTERSPECIFIC GENE FLOW IN SARRACENIA (SARRACENIACEAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise of the study: The role of hybridization in plant evolution remains a source of intense debate. Potential consequences range from genetic dead-ends to species fusion or hybrid speciation. While much has been learned from model systems such as Populus, Iris, and Helianthus, many questions remain. Consisting of 11 species that are all capable of hybridizing, Sarracenia presents an excellent system in which to study hybridization. Methods: Using microsatellites, we examined a single field site consisting of three species: S. leucophylla, S. alata, and S. rubra subsp. wherryi. We determined the level of genetic admixture and compared it with allopatric sites of the same taxa. Key results: In contrast to the well-defi ned clusters formed when we examined the allopatric sites, the sympatric field site exhibited a wide range of admixture. Additionally, when the relative genetic makeup of "pure" species at the site was compared with the makeup of hybrids, we found that Sarracenia alata contributed disproportionately to the hybrid genomes. Conclusions: Our study provides further evidence that hybridization is contributing to interspecifi c gene fl ow in the genus and that all species do not contribute equally to hybridization. Implications for conservation are discussed.	2013	10.3732/ajb.1300038		Plants	Ericales	Sarracenia	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	microsattelites (8 loci)	TRUE	
Martin, Helene; Touzet, Pascal; Dufay, Mathilde; Gode, Cecile; Schmitt, Eric; Lahiani, Emna; Delph, Lynda F.; Van Rossum, Fabienne	Lineages of Silene nutans developed rapid, strong, asymmetric postzygotic reproductive isolation in allopatry	EVOLUTION	Reproductive isolation can rise either as a consequence of genomic divergence in allopatry or as a byproduct of divergent selection in parapatry. To determine whether reproductive isolation in gynodioecious Silene nutans results from allopatric divergence or from ecological adaptation following secondary contact, we investigated the pattern of postzygotic reproductive isolation and hybridization in natural populations using two phylogeographic lineages, western (W1) and eastern (E1). Experimental crosses between the lineages identified strong, asymmetric postzygotic isolation between the W1 and the E1 lineages, independent of geographic overlap. The proportion of ovules fertilized, seeds aborted, and seeds germinated revealed relatively little effect on the fitness of hybrids. In contrast, hybrid mortality was high and asymmetric: while half of the hybrid seedlings with western lineage mothers died, nearly all hybrid seedlings with E1 mothers died. This asymmetric mortality mirrored the proportion of chlorotic seedlings, and is congruent with cytonuclear incompatibility. We found no evidence of hybridization between the lineages in regions of co-occurrence using nuclear and plastid markers. Together, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that strong postzygotic reproductive isolation involving cytonuclear incompatibilities arose in allopatry. We argue that the dynamics of cytonuclear gynodioecy could facilitate the evolution of reproductive isolation.	2017	10.1111/evo.13245		Plants	Caryophyllales	Silene	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (24 loci)	TRUE	
Meirmans, P. G.; Godbout, J.; Lamothe, M.; Thompson, S. L.; Isabel, N.	History rather than hybridization determines population structure and adaptation in Populus balsamifera	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Hybridization between species is known to greatly affect their genetic diversity and, therefore, their evolution. Also, within species, there may be genetic clusters between which gene flow is limited, which may impact natural selection. However, few studies have looked simultaneously at the influence of among-species and within-species gene flow. Here, we study the influence of hybridization between Populus balsamifera and Populustrichocarpa on population structure and adaptation in P.balsamifera. We did this by sampling a total of 1517 individuals from across the ranges of these two species, and by genotyping them using a combination of 93 nuclear and 17 cpDNA SNPs. We found that hybridization is mostly limited to the contact zone where the species' distributions overlap. Within P.balsamifera, we found multiple levels of population structure. Interestingly, the border between the Eastern and Central clusters is very sharp, whereas the border between the Central and Western clusters is diffuse. Outlier analysis revealed that three loci associated with the sharp border were also associated with climate. We hypothesize that the observed clusters derive from three refugia during the Pleistocene ice ages. Between the Central and Western clusters, post-glacial long-distance gene flow has led to the diffusion of their border. In the Eastern cluster, we hypothesize that endogenous genomic barriers have developed, leading to the sharp border and a spurious climate association. We conclude that the large-scale genetic structure of P.balsamifera is mostly shaped by historical factors and the influence of interspecific hybridization is limited.	2017	10.1111/jeb.13174		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microarray (118 loci)	TRUE	
Hardigan, Michael A.; Poorten, Thomas J.; Acharya, Charlotte B.; Cole, Glenn S.; Hummer, Kim E.; Bassil, Nahla; Edger, Patrick P.; Knapp, Steven J.	Domestication of Temperate and Coastal Hybrids with Distinct Ancestral Gene Selection in Octoploid Strawberry	PLANT GENOME	Garden strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne ex Rozier) arose from spontaneous hybridization of distinct octoploid species 300 yr ago. Since its discovery in the 1700s, migration and selection restructured the genetic diversity of early hybrids to produce elite fruit-bearing groups. Breeders' understanding of the genetic architecture of domesticated populations is incomplete. To resolve the impacts of domestication on strawberry genetic diversity, we analyzed genome-wide DNA profiles of 1300 octoploid individuals (1814-present), including wild species, historic varieties, and the University of California germplasm collection. Commercially important California genotypes, adapted to mild coastal climates and accounting for a large fraction of global production, have diverged from temperate cultivars originating in eastern North America and Europe. Whereas temperate cultivars were shown to have selected North American Fragaria virginiana Miller ssp. virginiana ancestral diversity at higher frequencies, coastal breeding increased selection of Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Miller (beach strawberry) alleles in F. x ananassa, in addition to photoperiod-insensitive flowering alleles from nonancestral F. virginiana (S. Watson) Staudt ssp. glauca, underscoring the role of continued adaptive introgressions in the domestication of artificial hybrids. Selection for mass production traits in coastal climates over the last 20 to 30 yr has restructured domesticated strawberry diversity on a scale similar to the first 200 yr of breeding; coastal F. x ananassa has diverged further from temperate F. x ananassa than the latter from their wild progenitors. Selection signatures indicate that strawberry domestication targeted genes regulating hormone-mediated fruit expansion, providing a blueprint for genetic factors underlying elite phenotypes.	2018	10.3835/plantgenome2018.07.0049		Plants	Rosales	Fragaria	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, trees	microarray (16599 loci)	TRUE	
Neophytou, Charalambos; Aravanopoulos, Filippos A.; Fink, Siegfried; Dounavi, Aikaterini	Interfertile oaks in an island environment. II. Limited hybridization between Quercus alnifolia Poech and Q. coccifera L. in a mixed stand	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH	Hybridization and introgression between Quercus alnifolia Poech and Q. coccifera L. is studied by analyzing morphological traits, nuclear and chloroplast DNA markers. The study site is a mixed stand on Troodos Mountains (Cyprus), and the analyzed material includes both adult trees and progenies of specific mother trees. Multivariate analysis of morphological traits shows that the two species can be well distinguished using simple leaf morphometric parameters. A lower genetic diversity in Q. alnifolia than in Q. coccifera and a high interspecific differentiation between the two species are supported by an analysis of nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites. The intermediacy of the four designated hybrids is verified by both leaf morphometric and genetic data. Analysis of progeny arrays provides evidence that interspecific crossings are rare. This finding is further supported by limited introgression of chloroplast genomes. Reproductive barriers (e.g. asynchronous phenology, postzygotic incompatibilities) might account for this result. A directionality of interspecific gene flow is indicated by a genetic assignment analysis of effective pollen clouds with Q. alnifolia acting as pollen donor. Differences in flowering phenology and species distribution in the stand may have influenced the direction of gene flow and the genetic differentiation among effective pollen clouds of different mother trees within species.	2011	10.1007/s10342-010-0454-4		Plants	Fagales	Quercus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (11)	TRUE	
Mitka, Jozef; Boron, Piotr; Wroblewska, Ada; Baba, Wojciech	AFLP analysis reveals infraspecific phylogenetic relationships and population genetic structure of two species of Aconitum in Central Europe	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE	The genetic diversity of two Aconitum species endemic to the Carpathian Mountains and Sudetes was studied. A reticulate evolution between them was earlier postulated as an effect of secondary contact. The genetic diversity at the individual and taxonomic levels was examined across the entire geographical ranges of the taxa in 11 populations based on 247 AFLP markers found in 112 individuals in the Sudetes and Western Carpathians. The overall genetic differentiation was greater within the Sudetic A. plicatum (F-ST = 0.139, P < 0.001) than within the Carpathian A. firmum (F-ST = 0.062, P < 0.001), presumably due to the long-lasting geographic isolation between the Giant Mts and Praded (Sudetes) populations of the species. Interestingly, relatively distant and presently isolated populations of A. plicatum and A. f. subsp. maninense share a part of their genomes. It could be an effect of their common evolutionary history, including past and present reticulations. The introgression among infraspecific taxa of Aconitum is common, probably as a result of seed dispersal within a distance of ca. 20 km (Mantel's r = 0.36, P = 0.01). Aconitum f. subsp. maninense had the highest genetic diversity indices: Nei's h and rarefied FAr, and divergence index DW (P <= 0.05), pointing to its presumably ancient age and long-term isolation.	2015	10.5586/asbp.2015.012		Plants	Ranunculales	Aconitum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	AFLP	TRUE	
Bardy, Katharina E.; Schoenswetter, Peter; Schneeweiss, Gerald M.; Fischer, Manfred A.; Albach, Dirk C.	Extensive gene flow blurs species boundaries among Veronica barrelieri, V. orchidea and V. spicata (Plantaginaceae) in southeastern Europe	TAXON	Little is known about the contribution of interspecific hybridization, a frequent phenomenon in plants, to the high plant diversity in southeastern Europe, one of the continent's diversity hot spots. A good system to study the relevance of hybridization for biodiversity in this region is Veronica subg. Pseudolysimachium sect. Pseudolysimachion (Plantaginaceae). Depending on the presumed frequency of hybridization, existing taxonomic concepts in this group range from distinguishing only morphological races without explicit taxonomic status to recognizing several species each with a series of intraspecific taxa. Using genetic (plastid sequences and AFLP fingerprints), ploidy-level and morphometric data, three core groups, pertaining to the currently recognized species V barrelieri, V orchidea, and V spicata, were identified. All three species are, however, connected by numerous and gradual genotypic transitions and show rampant discrepancies between genetic and morphometric-taxonomic assignments. Complete homogenization of the three core groups is probably prevented by geographic isolation, ecological divergence and ploidy differences. Misinterpretation of hybrid swarms as separate taxa and the mosaic distribution of different indumentum types have led to a gross overestimation of taxonomic diversity of V. sect. Pseucloly.simachion in southeastern Europe. Taxonomically, this might be accommodated by reducing V barrelieri, V orchidea and V spicata to subspeci fie rank and abandoning recognition at least of those subspecies and varieties included in our study.	2011	10.1002/tax.601010		Plants	Lamiales	Veronica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees	Sanger, AFLP	TRUE	
Collins, Emily; Sullivan, Alexis R.; Gailing, Oliver	Limited effective gene flow between two interfertile red oak species	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION	Highly elevated differentiation in different life stages between two interfertile oak species at a CONSTANS -like gene suggests a role of this gene in pre-zygotic isolation and adaptive divergence between species. Genome-wide differentiation patterns among oak species suggest that divergent selection can maintain species-specific adaptations and morphological integrity by reducing effective interspecific gene flow. While there is evidence for both pre- and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms in oaks (e.g., differences in flowering time, selection against hybrids), these mechanisms are rarely studied at each life stage from acorns to adult trees within the same forest. To assess the reproductive isolation mechanisms between two ecologically divergent species, we (1) quantified the number of hybrids in different life stages in Quercus rubra and Quercus ellipsoidalis, two interfertile red oaks with different adaptations to drought, and (2) assessed the timing of bud burst in both natural populations and in a seedling common garden trial. The low number of hybrids in all life stages suggested pre-zygotic isolation between species or selection in very early life stages that have not been sampled (e.g., early seed abortion). Significant differences in bud burst were found in two consecutive years between species in a common garden seedling trial but not in natural populations of the same provenance. In addition, we found evidence for divergent selection on several gene loci between species in each life stage. In particular, an SSR repeat located within the coding sequence of a CONSTANS-like gene, a locus involved in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering time and development, showed very high interspecific differentiation between species in all life stages (mean F (ST) = 0.83), compared to the average neutral differentiation of 3.7 %.	2015	10.1007/s00468-015-1194-3		Plants	Fagales	Quercus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS	microsattelites (36)	TRUE	
Liao, Rong-Li; Ma, Yong-Peng; Gong, Wei-Chang; Chen, Gao; Sun, Wei-Bang; Zhou, Ren-Chao; Marczewski, Tobias	Natural hybridization and asymmetric introgression at the distribution margin of two Buddleja species with a large overlap	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Natural hybridization in plants is universal and plays an important role in evolution. Based on morphology it has been presumed that hybridization occurred in the genus Buddleja, though genetic studies confirming this assumption have not been conducted to date. The two species B. crispa and B. officinalis overlap in their distributions over a wide range in South-West China, and we aimed to provide genetic evidence for ongoing hybridization in this study. Results: We investigated the occurrence of hybrids between the two species at the southern-most edge of the distribution of B. crispa using five nuclear loci and pollination experiments. The genetic data suggest substantial differentiation between the two species as species-specific alleles are separated by at least 7-28 mutations. The natural hybrids found were nearly all F1s (21 of 23), but backcrosses were detected, and some individuals, morphologically indistinguishable from the parental species, showed introgression. Pollen viability test shows that the percentage of viable pollen grains was 50 +/- 4 % for B. crispa, and 81 +/- 2 % for B. officinalis. This difference is highly significant (t = 7.382, p < 0.0001). Hand cross-pollination experiments showed that B. crispa is not successful as pollen-parent, but B. officinalis is able to pollinate B. crispa to produce viable hybrid seed. Inter-specific seed-set is low (8 seeds per fruit, as opposed to about 65 for intra-specific pollinations), suggesting post-zygotic reproductive barriers. In addition, one of the reference populations also suggests a history of introgression at other localities. Conclusions: The occurrence of morphologically intermediate individuals between B. crispa and B. officinalis at Xishan Mountain is unequivocally linked to hybridization and almost all examined individuals of the putative hybrids were likely F1s. Despite pollination experiments indicating higher chances for introgression into B. officinalis (hybrids only produced viable seed when crossed with B. officinalis), observed introgression was asymmetrical into B. crispa. This could be due to seeds produced by hybrids not contributing to seedlings, or other factors favoring the establishment of backcrosses towards B. crispa. However, further research will be needed to confirm these observations, as the small number of plants used for the pollination experiments could have introduced an artifact, for example if used individuals were more or less compatible than the species average, and also the small number of loci used could convey a picture of introgression that is not representative for the whole genome.	2015	10.1186/s12870-015-0539-9		Plants	Lamiales	Buddleja	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS	Sanger (5 genes)	TRUE	
Marques, Isabel; Draper, David; Riofrio, Lorena; Naranjo, Carlos	Multiple hybridization events, polyploidy and low postmating isolation entangle the evolution of neotropical species of Epidendrum (Orchidaceae)	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: Hybridization and polyploidy are central processes in evolution and speciation. These mechanisms often lead to complex patterns of genetic variation and the creation of novel genotypes, which may establish if they become isolated from gene flow. However, in the absence of reproductive isolation, species boundaries might easily be disrupted. Here, we used a combination of AFLPs, chloroplast DNA markers and flow cytometry to investigate the evolutionary outcomes of hybridization between two endemic Ecuadorian species of Epidendrum (E. madsenii and E. rhopalostele) in three hybrid zones. Postmating isolation was also quantified to determine the role of this barrier in restraining gene flow between hybrids and the parental species. In addition, future ecological niche models were constructed to predict the outcomes of hybridization between these species. Results: Our results confirmed the presence of hybrids in all hybrid zones, but revealed that a third parental species (E. falcisepalum) has contributed to one of the hybrid zones studied. Backcross genotypes were frequent in all hybrid zones, which was in accordance with the absence of strong reproductive barriers. The process of hybridization was highly asymmetric and followed in some cases by polyploidy. The projection of future niche models predicted a severe reduction in the area suitable for the occurrence of these species, although favorable conditions will still occur for the existence of the current hybrid zones. Conclusions: The recurrent process of hybridization has compromised the genetic integrity of the parental species. Most individuals of the parental species can no longer be considered as pure-bred individuals because most were classified as backcrossed hybrids. Novel genetic lineages occur in all hybrid zones implying that hybrids are fertile and can compete with the parental species. These results, together with the prediction of suitable conditions for the future occurrence of these hybrid zones, highlight the importance of conserving these geographic areas as sources of novel taxonomic entities.	2014	10.1186/1471-2148-14-20		Plants	Asparagales	Epidendrum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS	AFLP, Sanger	TRUE

RAMOSUS (POACEAE)	ACTA BIOLOGICA CRACOVIENSIA SERIES BOTANICA	The co-occurrence of hybrids and parental species in similar ecological niches poses a question on the role of traits additivity and overdispersion (emergence of new traits) in microevolutionary processes. We analysed genetic polymorphism of Bromus benekenii, B. ramosus and the spontaneous hybrid B. benekenii X B. ramosus in sympatric and allopatric parts of the species distribution in Europe, based on non-coding regions of the taxon genomes (ISSR genetic fingerprinting). We tested 68 individuals in 7 populations, including a hybrid population in N France. Altogether 233 polymorphic ISSR bands (loci) were obtained. We found that the parent species were genetically distinct and the hybrids had an additive pattern of ISSR bands found in the putative parental species (NMDS, STRUCTURE); however, there was evidence of introgression towards B. ramosus (NEWHYBRIDS, UPGMA classifications, Nei's D genetic distance). Bromus benekenii had 72, B. ramosus 21 and the hybrids 9 private bands (genetic overdispersion), probably resulting from the rearranged genomes. Based on its low genetic divergence index DW, the hybrid population seems to be at a young age. We argue that in the face of anthropogenic landscape transformations favouring secondary contacts, the hybrids may competitively replace the parental species in sympatric areas.	2015	10.1515/abcsb-2015-0015		Plants	Poales	Bromus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS	ISSR	TRUE	
Hamlin, Jennafer A. P.; Arnold, Michael L.	Determining population structure and hybridization for two iris species	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Identifying processes that promote or limit gene flow can help define the ecological and evolutionary history of a species. Furthermore, defining those factors that make up species boundaries can provide a definition of the independent evolutionary trajectories of related taxa. For many species, the historic processes that account for their distribution of genetic variation remain unresolved. In this study, we examine the geographic distribution of genetic diversity for two species of Louisiana Irises, Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva. Specifically, we asked how populations are structured and if population structure coincides with potential barriers to gene flow. We also asked whether there is evidence of hybridization between these two species outside Louisiana hybrid zones. We used a genotyping-by-sequencing approach and sampled a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms across these species' genomes. Two different population assignment methods were used to resolve population structure in I.brevicaulis; however, there was considerably less population structure in I.fulva. We used a species tree approach to infer phylogenies both within and between populations and species. For I.brevicaulis, the geography of the collection locality was reflected in the phylogeny. The I.fulva phylogeny reflected much less structure than detected for I.brevicaulis. Lastly, combining both species into a phylogenetic analysis resolved two of six populations of I.brevicaulis that shared alleles with I.fulva. Taken together, our results suggest major differences in the level and pattern of connectivity among populations of these two Louisiana Iris species.	2014	10.1002/ece3.964		Plants	Asparagales	Iris	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees	GBS	TRUE

Morphological versus genetic diversity of Viola reichenbachiana and V. riviniana (sect. Viola, Violaceae) from soils differing in heavy metal content	PLANT BIOLOGY	Morphological characters, AFLP markers and flow cytometry were used to investigate the morphological and genetic variability and differentiation of Viola reichenbachiana and V. riviniana in non-metallicolous (NM) and metallicolous (M) populations. The aims were to clarify the taxonomic status of plants occurring in ore-bearing areas, to determine any relationship in V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana from sites not polluted with heavy metals, and to examine the genetic variability and differentiation of M and NM populations of both species. Multivariate analyses based on morphological characters showed significant differences between V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana from non-polluted sites, high levels of intra-and inter-population variability, and the occurrence of inter-specific hybrids. Plants from M populations showed hybrid characters but also fell within the range of V. riviniana or V. reichenbachiana. There were no significant differences in relative genome size between plants from polluted areas and V. riviniana from NM populations. Bayesian analysis of population genetic structure based on AFLP markers distinguished two main groups: V. reichenbachiana and V. riviniana together with the M populations. That analysis also revealed the occurrence of populations of inter-specific hybrids from non-polluted areas. Further Bayesian analysis of V. riviniana including NM and M populations separated all the studied M populations from NM populations. We conclude that plants forming the M populations are well adapted to a metal-polluted environment, and could be considered as stabilised introgressive forms resulting from unidirectional (asymmetric) introgression toward V. riviniana.	2014	10.1111/plb.12143		Plants	Malpighiales	Viola	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees, sequence similarity	AFLP (149 loci)	TRUE	
Ley, A. C.; Hardy, O. J.	Contrasting patterns of gene flow between sister plant species in the understorey of African moist forests - The case of sympatric and parapatric Marantaceae species	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Gene flow within and between species is a fundamental process shaping the evolutionary history of taxa. However, the extent of hybridization and reinforcement is little documented in the tropics. Here we explore the pattern of gene flow between three sister species from the herbaceous genus Marantochloa (Marantaceae), sympatrically distributed in the understorey of the African rainforest, using data from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes (DNA sequences and AFLP). We found highly contrasting patterns: while there was no evidence of gene flow between M. congensis and M. monophylla, species identity between M. monophylla and M. incertifolia was maintained despite considerable gene flow. We hypothesize that M. incertzfolia originated from an ancient hybridization event between M. congensis and M. monophylla, considering the current absence of hybridization between the two assumed parent species, the rare presence of shared haplotypes between all three species and the high percentage of haplotypes shared by M. incertifolia with each of the two parent species. This example is contrasted with two parapatrically distributed species from the same family in the genus Haumania forming a hybrid zone restricted to the area of overlap. This work illustrates the diversity of speciation/introgression patterns that can potentially occur in the flora of tropical Africa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Lindtke, Dorothea; Buerkle, C. A.; Barbara, Thelma; Heinze, Berthold; Castiglione, Stefano; Bartha, Denes; Lexer, Christian	Recombinant hybrids retain heterozygosity at many loci: new insights into the genomics of reproductive isolation in Populus	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The maintenance of species barriers in the face of gene flow is often thought to result from strong selection against intermediate genotypes, thereby preserving genetic differentiation. Most speciation genomic studies thus aim to identify exceptionally divergent loci between populations, but divergence will be affected by many processes other than reproductive isolation (RI) and speciation. Through genomic studies of recombinant hybrids sampled in the wild, genetic variation associated with RI can be observed in situ, because selection against incompatible genotypes will leave detectable patterns of variation in the hybrid genomes. To better understand the mechanisms directly involved in RI, we investigated three natural replicate hybrid zones between two divergent Populus species via locus-specific patterns of ancestry across recombinant hybrid genomes. As expected, genomic patterns in hybrids and their parental species were consistent with the presence of underdominant selection at several genomic regions. Surprisingly, many loci displayed greatly increased between-species heterozygosity in recombinant hybrids despite striking genetic differentiation between the parental genomes, the opposite of what would be expected with selection against intermediate genotypes. Only a limited, reproducible set of genotypic combinations was present in hybrid genomes across localities. In the absence of clearly delimited hybrid habitats, our results suggest that complex epistatic interactions within genomes play an important role in advanced stages of RI between these ecologically divergent forest trees. This calls for more genomic studies that test for unusual patterns of genomic ancestry in hybridizing species.	2012	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05744.x		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelite (77 loci)	TRUE	
Goemoery, D.; Paule, L.; Krajmerova, D.; Romsakova, I.; Piecka, J.	Gene exchange across a postglacial contact zone in Fraxinus excelsior L.	SILVAE GENETICA	Hybridization between divergent lineages of common ash Fraxinus excelsior L. was studied in Slovakia and adjacent regions of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland in the contact zone between two postglacial colonization routes originating from different glacial refugia. Thirty-eight common ash populations were studied using a combination of 6 maternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite markers and 7 biparentally inherited nuclear microsatellites (nSSR). Two predominant chloroplast lineages were identified, between which the boundary was very sharp. Populations containing a mixture of different haplotypes were found only in the immediate proximity of the boundary. Bayesian analysis of population structure based on nSSR loci revealed the existence of two clusters, which largely coincided with chloroplast lineages. Both haplotype frequencies and proportions of clusters identified by the Bayesian analysis exhibited a clinal transition over the hybrid zone, with cline widths of 36 km for chloroplast haplotype frequencies (reflecting gene flow by seeds) and 275 km for Bayesian clusters based on nSSR (reflecting gene flow by pollen and seeds). Chloroplast haplotype diversity increased along the boundary between lineages not only because of admixture, but also due to the presence of rare haplotypes. In contrast, diversity at nuclear loci did not exhibit any geographical trend.	2012	10.1515/sg-2012-0003		Plants	Lamiales	Fraxinus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, clines	microsattelite (17 loci)	TRUE

The genetic relationships and origins of the Asian pear are still unclear because of frequent hybrid events, fast radial evolution, and lack of informative data. Here, we developed fluorescent sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (SSAP) markers with lots of informative sites and high polymorphism to analyze the population structure among 93 pear accessions, including nearly all species native to Asia. Results of a population structure analysis indicated that nearly all Asian pear species experienced hybridization, and originated from five primitive genepools. Four genepools corresponded to four primary Asian species: P. betulaefolia, P. pashia, P. pyrifolia, and P. ussuriensis. However, cultivars of P. ussuriensis were not monophyletic and introgression occurred from P. pyrifolia. The specific genepool detected in putative hybrids between occidental and oriental pears might be from occidental pears. The remaining species, including P. calleryana, P. xerophila, P. sinkiangensis, P. phaeocarpa, P. hondoensis, and P. hopeiensis in Asia, were inferred to be of hybrid origins and their possible genepools were identified. This study will be of great help for understanding the origin and evolution of Asian pears.	2016	10.1371/journal.pone.0149192		Plants	Rosales	Pyrus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees	SSAP	TRUE	
Cavallari, Marcelo Mattos; Gimenes, Marcos Aparecido; Billot, Claire; Torres, Roseli Buzanelli; Zucchi, Maria Imaculada; Cavalheiro, Alberto Jose; Bouvet, Jean-Marc	Population genetic relationships between Casearia sylvestris (Salicaceae) varieties occurring sympatrically and allopatrically in different ecosystems in south-east Brazil	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Species delimitation can be problematic, and recently diverged taxa are sometimes viewed as the extremes of a species' continuum in response to environmental conditions. Using population genetic approaches, this study assessed the relationship between two Casearia sylvestris (Salicaceae) varieties, which occur sympatrically and allopatrically in the landscape of south-east Brazil, where intermediate types are also found. In total, 376 individuals from nine populations in four different ecosystems were sampled, and nine microsatellite markers were used to assess the relative effects of the ecosystems and varieties on the distribution of genetic diversity among populations of this species. As a by-product of this study, several PCR products with more than two alleles were observed. The possibility that extra bands represent non-specific amplification or PCR artefacts was discarded by sequencing a sample of these bands. We suggest that (partial) genome duplication in C. sylvestris most probably explains this phenomenon, which may be a key factor in the differentiation of the two taxa, as it was markedly more frequent in one of the varieties. AMOVA indicated that approx. 22 % of the total genetic diversity was found between the two varieties. Bayesian analysis identified varieties and ecosystems as evolutionary units, rather than the individual populations sampled. The results are in agreement with field observations and support the recognition of two varieties, as well as documenting the occurrence of hybridization between them.	2010	10.1093/aob/mcq151		Plants	Malpighiales	Casearia	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (10), Sanger (1 gene)	TRUE	
De La Torre, Amanda R.; Roberts, David R.; Aitken, Sally N.	Genome-wide admixture and ecological niche modelling reveal the maintenance of species boundaries despite long history of interspecific gene flow	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The maintenance of species boundaries despite interspecific gene flow has been a continuous source of interest in evolutionary biology. Many hybridizing species have porous genomes with regions impermeable to introgression, conferring reproductive barriers between species. We used ecological niche modelling to study the glacial and postglacial recolonization patterns between the widely hybridizing spruce species Picea glauca and P.engelmannii in western North America. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 311 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 290 genes were used to assess levels of admixture and introgression and to identify loci putatively involved in adaptive differences or reproductive barriers between species. Our palaeoclimatic modelling suggests that these two closely related species have a long history of hybridization and introgression, dating to at least 21000years ago, yet species integrity is maintained by a combination of strong environmental selection and reduced current interspecific gene flow. Twenty loci showed evidence of divergent selection, including six loci that were both F-st outliers and associated with climatic gradients, and fourteen loci that were either outliers or showed associations with climate. These included genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction and transcription factors.	2014	10.1111/mec.12710		Plants	Pinales	Picea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, PCA	microarray	TRUE	
Bitocchi, Elena; Bellucci, Elisa; Rau, Domenico; Albertini, Emidio; Rodriguez, Monica; Veronesi, Fabio; Attene, Giovanna; Nanni, Laura	European Flint Landraces Grown In Situ Reveal Adaptive Introgression from Modern Maize	PLOS ONE	We have investigated the role of selection in the determination of the detected levels of introgression from modern maize hybrid varieties into maize landraces still cultivated in situ in Italy. We exploited the availability of a historical collection of landraces undertaken before the introduction and widespread use of modern maize, to analyse genomic changes that have occurred in these maize landraces over 50 years of co-existence with hybrid varieties. We have combined a previously published SSR dataset (n=21) with an AFLP loci dataset (n=168) to provide higher resolution power and to obtain a more detailed picture. We show that selection pressures for adaptation have favoured new alleles introduced by migration from hybrids. This shows the potential for analysis of historical introgression even over this short period of 50 years, for an understanding of the evolution of the genome and for the identification of its functionally important regions. Moreover, this demonstrates that landraces grown in situ represent almost unique populations for use for such studies when the focus is on the domesticated plant. This is due to their adaptation, which has arisen from their dynamic evolution under a continuously changing agro-ecological environment, and their capture of new alleles from hybridisation. We have also identified loci for which selection has inhibited introgression from modern germplasm and has enhanced the distinction between landraces and modern maize. These loci indicate that selection acted in the past, during the formation of the flint and dent gene pools. In particular, the locus showing the strongest signals of selection is a Misfit transposable element. Finally, molecular characterisation of the same samples with two different molecular markers has allowed us to compare their performances. Although the genetic-diversity and population-structure analyses provide the same global qualitative pattern, which thus provides the same inferences, there are differences related to their natures and characteristics.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0121381		Plants	Poales	Zea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	AFLP, microsattelites	TRUE	
Marques, I.; Draper, D.; Lopez-Herranz, M. L.; Garnatje, T.; Segarra-Moragues, J. G.; Catalan, P.	Past climate changes facilitated homoploid speciation in three mountain spiny fescues (Festuca, Poaceae)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	Apart from the overwhelming cases of allopolyploidization, the impact of speciation through homoploid hybridization is becoming more relevant than previously thought. Much less is known, however, about the impact of climate changes as a driven factor of speciation. To investigate these issues, we selected Festuca picoeuropeana, an hypothetical natural hybrid between the diploid species F. eskia and F. gautieri that occurs in two different mountain ranges (Cantabrian Mountains and Pyrenees) separated by more than 400 km. To unravel the outcomes of this mode of speciation and the impact of climate during speciation we used a multidisciplinary approach combining genome size and chromosome counts, data from an extensive nuclear genotypic analysis, plastid sequences and ecological niche models (ENM). Our results show that the same homoploid hybrid was originated independently in the two mountain ranges, being currently isolated from both parents and producing viable seeds. Parental species had the opportunity to contact as early as 21000 years ago although niche divergence occurs nowadays as result of a climate-driven shift. A high degree of niche divergence was observed between the hybrid and its parents and no recent introgression or backcrossed hybrids were detected, supporting the current presence of reproductive isolation barriers between these species.	2016	10.1038/srep36283		Plants	Poales	Festuca	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS, sequence similarity	microsattelites (10)	TRUE	
Nielsen, Lene Rostgaard; Brandes, Ursula; Kjaer, Erik Dahl; Fjellheim, Siri	Introduced Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) invades the genome of native populations in vulnerable heathland habitats	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Cytisus scoparius is a global invasive species that affects local flora and fauna at the intercontinental level. Its natural distribution spans across Europe, but seeds have also been moved among countries, mixing plants of native and non-native genetic origins. Hybridization between the introduced and native gene pool is likely to threaten both the native gene pool and the local flora. In this study, we address the potential threat of invasive C. scoparius to local gene pools in vulnerable heathlands. We used nuclear single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers together with plastid SSR and indel markers to investigate the level and direction of gene flow between invasive and native heathland C. scoparius. Analyses of population structures confirmed the presence of two gene pools: one native and the other invasive. The nuclear genome of the native types was highly introgressed with the invasive genome, and we observed advanced-generation hybrids, suggesting that hybridization has been occurring for several generations. There is asymmetrical gene flow from the invasive to the native gene pool, which can be attributed to higher fecundity in the invasive individuals, measured by the number of flowers and seed pods. Strong spatial genetic structure in plastid markers and weaker structure in nuclear markers suggest that seeds spread over relatively short distances and that gene flow over longer distances is mainly facilitated by pollen dispersal. We further show that the growth habits of heathland plants become more vigorous with increased introgression from the invaders. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to future management of invading C. scoparius.	2016	10.1111/mec.13666		Plants	Fabales	Cytisus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS, sequence similarity	RAD, microsattelites, Sanger	TRUE	
Zhou, Xincheng; Yang, Xinming; Li, Xiuquan; Li, Lihui	Genome origins in Leymus (Poaceae: Triticeae): evidence of maternal and paternal progenitors and implications for reticulate evolution	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	The polyploid Leymus species have the Ns nuclear genomes evolved from Psathyrostachys and the Xm nuclear genomes from unknown origins. Currently, little is known about the cytoplasmic genomes of Leymus, and the species of Psathyrostachys that transferred the Ns genome to Leymus remain elusive. To determine the origins of the plastid and nuclear genome for Leymus species, sequences of two chloroplast genes, rpoA and rbcL, and partial sequences of the nuclear gene DMC1 of 15 Leymus species were phylogenetically analyzed with those of 71 accessions belonging to 19 monogenomic genera in Triticeae. Both rpoA and rbcL sequences revealed that Psathyrostachys juncea, P. lanuginosa, and P. stoloniformis had close phylogenetic relationships with the Eurasian and one North American Leymus accessions, L. cinereus. Three American Leymus species, L. erianthus, L. triticoides, and L. innovatus had different maternal origins from Eurasian Leymus species. DMC1 sequences of Leymus were grouped into several phylogenetically distant clades indicating that either Ns or Xm originated from different lineages. These results suggest multiple contributions to the chloroplast as well as nuclear genomes in Leymus species. The comprehensive data indicate reticulate evolution in polyploid Leymus.	2010	10.1007/s00606-010-0341-y		Plants	Poales	Leymus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, trees	Sanger (3 genes)	TRUE	
Ricca, M.; Szoevenyi, P.; Temsch, E. M.; Johnson, M. G.; Shaw, A. J.	Interploidal hybridization and mating patterns in the Sphagnum subsecundum complex	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Polyploidization is thought to result in instant sympatric speciation, but several cases of hybrid zones between one of the parental species and its polyploid derivative have been documented. Previous work showed that diploid Sphagnum lescurii is an allopolyploid derived from the haploids S. lescurii (maternal progenitor) and S. subsecundum (paternal progenitor). Here, we report the results from analyses of a population where allodiploid and haploid S. lescurii co-occur and produce sporophytes. We tested (i) whether haploids and diploids form hybrid triploid sporophytes; (ii) how hybrid and nonhybrid sporophytes compare in fitness; (iii) whether hybrid sporophytes form viable spores; (iv) the ploidy of any viable gametophyte offspring from hybrid sporophytes; (v) the relative viability of sporelings derived from hybrid and nonhybrid sporophytes; and (vi) if interploidal hybridization results in introgression between the allopolyploid and its haploid progenitor. We found that triploid hybrid sporophytes do occur and are larger than nonhybrid sporophytes, but exhibit very low germination percentages and produce sporelings that develop more slowly than those from nonhybrid sporophytes. All sporophytes attached to haploid gametophytes were triploid and were sired by diploid males, but all sporophytes attached to diploid gametophytes were tetraploid. This asymmetric pattern of interploidal hybridization is related to an absence of haploid male gametophytes in the population. Surprisingly, all sporelings from triploid sporophytes were triploid, yet were genetically variable, suggesting some form of aberrant meiosis that warrants further study. There was limited (but some) evidence of introgression between allodiploid and haploid S. lescurii.	2011	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05170.x		Plants	Sphagnales	Sphagnum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	microsattelites (18)	TRUE	
Kumar, Satish; Kirk, Chris; Deng, Cecilia; Wiedow, Claudia; Knaebel, Mareike; Brewer, Lester	Genotyping-by-sequencing of pear (Pyrus spp.) accessions unravels novel patterns of genetic diversity and selection footprints	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH	Understanding of genetic diversity and marker-trait relationships in pears (Pyrus spp.) forms an important part of gene conservation and cultivar breeding. Accessions of Asian and European pear species, and interspecific hybrids were planted in a common garden experiment. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used to genotype 214 accessions, which were also phenotyped for fruit quality traits. A combination of selection scans and association analyses were used to identify signatures of selection. Patterns of genetic diversity, population structure and introgression were also investigated. About 15 000 high-quality SNP markers were identified from the GBS data, of which 25% and 11% harboured private alleles for European and Asian species, respectively. Bayesian clustering analysis suggested negligible gene flow, resulting in highly significant population differentiation (F-st = 0.45) between Asian and European pears. Interspecific hybrids displayed an average of 55% and 45% introgression from their Asian and European ancestors, respectively. Phenotypic (firmness, acidity, shape and so on) variation between accessions was significantly associated with genetic differentiation. Allele frequencies at large-effect SNP loci were significantly different between genetic groups, suggesting footprints of directional selection. Selection scan analyses identified over 20 outlier SNP loci with substantial statistical support, likely to be subject to directional selection or closely linked to loci under selection	2017	10.1038/hortres.2017.15		Plants	Rosales	Pyrus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	GBS	TRUE	
Kane, Nolan C.; King, Matthew G.; Barker, Michael S.; Raduski, Andrew; Karrenberg, Sophie; Yatabe, Yoko; Knapp, Steven J.; Rieseberg, Loren H.	COMPARATIVE GENOMIC AND POPULATION GENETIC ANALYSES INDICATE HIGHLY POROUS GENOMES AND HIGH LEVELS OF GENE FLOW BETWEEN DIVERGENT HELIANTHUS SPECIES	EVOLUTION	While speciation can be found in the presence of gene flow, it is not clear what impact this gene flow has on genome- and range-wide patterns of differentiation. Here we examine gene flow across the entire range of the common sunflower, H. annuus, its historically allopatric sister species H. argophyllus and a more distantly related, sympatric relative H. petiolaris. Analysis of genotypes at 26 microsatellite loci in 1015 individuals from across the range of the three species showed substantial introgression between geographically proximal populations of H. annuus and H. petiolaris, limited introgression between H. annuus and H. argophyllus, and essentially no gene flow between the allopatric pair, H. argophyllus and H. petiolaris. Analysis of sequence divergence levels among the three species in 1420 orthologs identified from EST databases identified a subset of loci showing extremely low divergence between H. annuus and H. petiolaris and extremely high divergence between the sister species H. annuus and H. argophyllus, consistent with introgression between H. annuus and H. petiolaris at these loci. Thus, at many loci, the allopatric sister species are more genetically divergent than the more distantly related sympatric species, which have exchanged genes across much of the genome while remaining morphologically and ecologically distinct.	2009	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00703.x		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, demogrpahy	microsattelites (26)	TRUE

We sought to gain insight into the degree of introgression and the extent of ecological-phenotypic intermediacy in the natural hybrid strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa subsp. cuneifolia. Methods: We used whole-plastome sequencing to identify parental species-specific (Fragaria chiloensis and F. virginiana) chloroplast single-nucleotide polymorphisms and combined the use of these with nuclear microsatellite markers to genetically characterize the hybrid zone. We assessed the potential role of selection in the observed geographic patterns by bioclimatically characterizing the niche of the hybrid populations and phenotypically characterizing hybrid individuals of known genomic constitution. Key Results: Significant admixture and little overall maternal bias in chloroplast or nuclear genomes suggest a high degree of interfertility among the parental and hybrid species and point to a long history of backcrossing and genetic mixing in the hybrid zone. Even though hybrids were phenotypically intermediate to the parental species, there was a discernible fingerprint of the parental genotype within hybrid individuals. Thus, although the pattern of introgression observed suggests geographic limitations to gene flow, it may be reinforced by selection for specific parental traits in the bioclimatically intermediate habitat occupied by the hybrid. Conclusions: This work uncovered the genetic complexity underlying the hybrid zone of the wild relatives of the cultivated strawberry. It lays the foundation for experimental dissection of the causes of genomic introgression and nuclear-cytoplasmic disassociation, and for understanding other parts of Fragaria evolutionary history.	2013	10.3732/ajb.1200624		Plants	Rosales	Fragaria	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	Sanger, microsattelites (10)	TRUE	
Scascitelli, M.; Whitney, K. D.; Randell, R. A.; King, Matthew; Buerkle, C. A.; Rieseberg, L. H.	Genome scan of hybridizing sunflowers from Texas (Helianthus annuus and H. debilis) reveals asymmetric patterns of introgression and small islands of genomic differentiation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Although the sexual transfer of genetic material between species (i.e. introgression) has been documented in many groups of plants and animals, genome-wide patterns of introgression are poorly understood. Is most of the genome permeable to interspecific gene flow, or is introgression typically restricted to a handful of genomic regions? Here, we assess the genomic extent and direction of introgression between three sunflowers from the south-central USA: the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus ssp. annuus; a near-endemic to Texas, Helianthus debilis ssp. cucumerifolius; and their putative hybrid derivative, thought to have recently colonized Texas, H. annuus ssp. texanus. Analyses of variation at 88 genetically mapped microsatellite loci revealed that long-term migration rates were high, genome-wide and asymmetric, with higher migration rates from H. annuus texanus into the two parental taxa than vice versa. These results imply a longer history of intermittent contact between H. debilis and H. annuus than previously believed, and that H. annuus texanus may serve as a bridge for the transfer of alleles between its parental taxa. They also contradict recent theory suggesting that introgression should predominantly be in the direction of the colonizing species. As in previous studies of hybridizing sunflower species, regions of genetic differentiation appear small, whether estimated in terms of FST or unidirectional migration rates. Estimates of recent immigration and admixture were inconsistent, depending on the type of analysis. At the individual locus level, one marker showed striking asymmetry in migration rates, a pattern consistent with tight linkage to a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility.	2010	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04504.x		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, demography	microsattelites	TRUE	
Sherman, Natasha A.; Burke, John M.	Population genetic analysis reveals a homoploid hybrid origin of Stephanomeria diegensis (Asteraceae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Homoploid hybrid speciation has generally been viewed as a rare evolutionary phenomenon, with relatively few well-documented cases in nature. Here, we investigate the origin of Stephanomeria diegensis, a diploid flowering plant species that has been proposed to have arisen as a result of hybridization between S. exigua and S. virgata. Across the range of S. diegensis, all individuals share a common chloroplast haplotype with S. virgata while showing a greater affinity for S. exigua in terms of nuclear genetic diversity. A prinicipal coordinates analysis (PCO) based on the nuclear data revealed that S. diegensis is most similar to each parent along different axes. Moreover, a Bayesian clustering analysis as well as a hybrid index-based analysis showed evidence of mixed ancestry, with approximately two thirds of the S. diegensis nuclear genome derived from S. exigua. These results provide strong support for a homoploid hybrid origin of S. diegensis. Finally, contrary to the finding that homoploid hybrid species are typically multiply-derived, our results were most consistent with a single origin of this species.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04349.x		Plants	Asterales	Stephanomeria	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	Sanger (7), SSR	TRUE	
Zitari, A.; Scopece, G.; Helal, A. N.; Widmer, A.; Cozzolino, S.	Is floral divergence sufficient to maintain species boundaries upon secondary contact in Mediterranean food-deceptive orchids?	HEREDITY	Analyzing the processes that determine whether species boundaries are maintained on secondary contact may shed light on the early phase of speciation. In Anacamptis mono and Anacamptis longicornu, two Mediterranean orchid sister-species, we used molecular and morphological analyses, together with estimates of pollination success and experimental crosses, to assess whether floral isolation can shelter the species' genomes from genetic: admixture on secondary contact. We found substantial genetic and morphological homogenization in sympatric populations in combination with an apparent lack of postmating isolation. We further detected asymmetric introgression in the sympatric populations and an imbalance in cytotype representation, which may be clue either to a difference in flowering phenology or else be a consequence of cytonuclear incompatibilities. Estimates of genetic clines for markers across sympatric zones revealed markers that significantly deviated from neutral expectations. We observed a significant correlation between spur length and reproductive success in sympatric populations, which may suggest that directional selection is the main cause of morphological differentiation in this species pair. Our results suggest that allopatric divergence has not led to the evolution of sufficient reproductive isolation to prevent genomic admixture on secondary contact in this orchid species pair.

Hamilton, Jill A.; Lexer, Christian; Aitken, Sally N.	Genomic and phenotypic architecture of a spruce hybrid zone (Picea sitchensis P. glauca)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Interspecific hybridization may enhance the capacity of populations to adapt to changing environments, and has practical implications for reforestation. We use genome-wide estimates of admixture and phenotypic traits for trees in a common garden to examine the extent and direction of gene flow across a Picea hybrid zone, testing assumptions of the bounded hybrid superiority and tension zone models of hybrid zone maintenance. Seeds were collected from the ecological transition zone spanning from maritime to continental climates across the Picea sitchensisP. glauca contact zone, and 721 trees were planted in a common garden experiment within the hybrid zone. Individuals were genotyped using a panel of 384 candidate-gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) putatively associated with adaptive traits in Picea, and phenotyped at age ten for height and autumn cold hardiness. Low interspecific heterozygosity in hybrids indicated that intrinsic reproductive barriers were too weak to prevent widespread recombination, although introgression appeared asymmetric with P. sitchensis dominating the zone. Whereas marker-based hybrid index was strongly correlated with climate and geography, phenotypic traits exhibited weak or no significant clines. Our results indicated that exogenous selection appeared to play a strong role in the distribution and structure of this hybrid zone, indicative of an environmentally determined bounded hybrid superiority model of hybrid zone maintenance, although endogenous mechanisms could not be ruled out. This study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying adaptation across ecologically transitional hybrid zones that will ultimately provide an additional tool in managing these economically important tree species.	2013	10.1111/mec.12007		Plants	Pinales	Picea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, INTROGRESS, clines	microarray	TRUE	
Fan, Qiang; Chen, Sufang; Li, Mingwan; Guo, Wei; Jing, Huijuan; Wu, Wei; Zhou, Renchao; Liao, Wenbo	Molecular evidence for natural hybridization between wild loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) and its relative E. prinoides	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Interspecific hybridization has long been recognized as a pivotal process in plant evolution and speciation. It occurs fairly common in the genera of the subtribe Pyrinae. In Eriobotrya, a small tree genus of Pyrinae, E. prinoides var. daduheensis has been recognized as either a variety of E. prinoides, a natural hybrid between E. prinoides and E. japonica, or a variety of E. japonica. However, to date, there has been no convincing evidence on its status. Results: Four nuclear genes and two chloroplast regions were sequenced in 89 individuals of these three Eriobotrya taxa from two locations where they coexist. A few fixed nucleotide substitutions or gaps were found in each of the investigated nuclear and chloroplast loci between E. japonica and E. prinoides. Of the 35 individuals of E. prinoides var. daduheensis, 33 showed nucleotide additivity of E. japonica and E. prinoides in at least one nuclear gene, and 10 of them harboured nucleotide additivity at all the four nuclear genes. Most haplotypes of E. prinoides var. daduheensis were also shared with those of E. japonica and E. prinoides. In the two chloroplast regions, 28 and 7 individuals were identical with E. japonica and E. prinoides, respectively. Conclusions: Our study provides compelling evidence for a hybrid status for E. prinoides var. daduheensis. Most hybrid individuals are later-generation hybrids. Both E. japonica and E. prinoides can serve as female parent. Differential adaptation might maintain the species boundary of E. prinoides and E. japonica in the face of hybridization and potential introgression.	2014	10.1186/s12870-014-0275-6		Plants	Rosales	Eriobotrya	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (6 genes)	TRUE	
Gaudeul, Myriam; Siljak-Yakovlev, Sonja; Jang, Tae-Soo; Rouhan, Germinal	Reconstructing Species Relationships within the Recently Diversified Genus Odontites Ludw. (Orobanchaceae): Evidence for Extensive Reticulate Evolution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES	Premise of research.Odontites is an herbaceous genus composed of 27 species, mostly distributed around the Mediterranean Basin. As a first step toward studying species diversification within this genus, our goals were to (i) test previous hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships among species; (ii) assess whether the closely related genera Bartsiella, Bornmuellerantha, Macrosyringion, and Odontitella should be included in Odontites; and (iii) detect potential events of reticulate evolution.Methodology.We estimated phylogenetic relationships based on nuclear (ITS and ETS) and chloroplast (psbA-trnH, trnC-ycf6, and trnL-trnF) DNA regions. Our sampling included 184 individuals representing 25 out of the 27 species of Odontites. We also counted chromosomes in five species and measured nuclear genome sizes in 139 individuals of 21 species.Pivotal results.We showed that Bartsiella and Bornmuellerantha should be returned to Odontites, while Odontitella was confirmed as distinct. Macrosyringion requires further investigations. Several phylogenetic incongruences were identified, suggesting two cases of hybrid speciation (in O. maroccanus and O. violaceus) and several introgression events. These events were very diverse in terms of number of individuals involved, species co-occurrence, direction of introgression, and incidence of genome doubling. We obtained new chromosome numbers for O. hispidulus (2n=4x=40) and O. powellii (2n=2x=20), and no relation between nuclear genome size and chromosome number was found.Conclusions.We inferred hybrid speciation and various introgression events, and polyploidy was also detected. Odontites appears as an interesting genus to study species diversification, providing a group of closely related species that display, e.g., morphological, ecological, or phenological character variation; cases of study at different temporal stages in the diversification process; and several contact zones between species.	2018	10.1086/694763		Plants	Lamiales	Odontites	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger	TRUE

Arachis batizocoi: a study of its relationship to cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea) and its potential for introgression of wild genes into the peanut crop using induced allotetraploids	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims Arachis batizocoi is a wild relative of cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea), an allotetraploid with an AABB genome. Arachis batizocoi was once considered the ancestral donor of the peanut B genome, but cytogenetics and DNA phylogenies have indicated a new genome classification, 'K'. These observations seem inconsistent with genetic studies and breeding that have shown that A. batizocoi can behave as a B genome. Methods The genetic behaviour, genome composition and phylogenetic position of A. batizocoi were studied using controlled hybridizations, induced tetraploidy, whole-genome in situ fluorescent hybridization (GISH) and molecular phylogenetics. Key Results Sterile diploid hybrids containing AK genomes were obtained using A. batizocoi and the A genome species A. duranensis, A. stenosperma, A. correntina or A. villosa. From these, three types of AAKK allotetraploids were obtained, each in multiple independent polyploidy events. Induced allotetraploids were vigorous and fertile, and were hybridized to A. hypogaea to produce F-1 hybrids. Even with the same parental combination, fertility of these F-1 hybrids varied greatly, suggesting the influence of stochastic genetic or epigenetic events. Interestingly, hybrids with A. hypogaea ssp. hypogaea were significantly more fertile than those with the subspecies fastigiata. GISH in cultivated x induced allotetraploids hybrids (harbouring AABK genomes) and a molecular phylogeny using 16 intron sequences showed that the K genome is distinct, but more closely related to the B than to the A genome. Conclusions The K genome of A. batizocoi is more related to B than to the A genome, but is distinct. As such, when incorporated in an induced allotetraploid (AAKK) it can behave as a B genome in crosses with peanut. However, the fertility of hybrids and their progeny depends upon the compatibility of the A genome interactions. The genetic distinctness of A. batizocoi makes it an important source of allelic diversity in itself, especially in crosses involving A. hypogaea ssp. hypogaea.	2015	10.1093/aob/mcu237		Plants	Fabales	Arachis	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger	TRUE

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggested that: (1) the St, H, W, and P genomes were donated by Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum, Australopyrum, and Agropyron, respectively, while the Y genome is closely related to the Xp genome in Peridictyon sanctum; (2) different hexaploid Elymus s.l. species may derived their StY genome from different StY genome tetraploid species via independent origins; (3) due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybridization events, the genealogical conflict between the two gene trees suggest introgression involving some Elymus s.l. species, Pseudoroegneria, Agropyron and Aegilops/Triticum; (4) it is reasonable to recognize the StH genome species as Elymus sensu stricto, the StY genome species as Roegneria, the StYW genome species as Anthosachne, the StYH genome species as Campeiostachys, and the StYP genome species as Kengyilia. The occurrence of multiple origin and introgression could account for the rich diversity and ecological adaptation of Elymus s.l. species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Okuyama, Y; Fujii, N; Wakabayashi, M; Kawakita, A; Ito, M; Watanabe, M; Murakami, N; Kato, M	Nonuniform concerted evolution and chloroplast capture: Heterogeneity of observed introgression patterns in three molecular data partition phylogenies of Asian Mitella (Saxifragaceae)	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Interspecific hybridization is one of the major factors leading to phylogeneric incongruence among loci. but the knowledge is still limited about the potential of each locus to introgress between species. By directly sequencing three DNA regions: chloroplast DNAs (matK gene and trnL-F noncoding region), the nuclear ribosomal external transcribed spacer (ETS) region, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. we construct three phylogenetic trees of Asian species of Mitella (Saxifragaceae), a genus of perennials in which natural hybrids are commonly observed. Within this genus. there is a significant topological conflict between chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies and also between the ETS and the ITS, which can be attributed to frequent hybridization within the lineage. Chloroplast DNAs show the most extensive introgression pattern, ITS regions show a moderate pattern. and the ETS region shows no evidence of introgression. Nonuniform concerted evolution best explains the difference in the introgression patterns between the ETS region and ITS regions, as the sequence heterogeneity of the ITS region within an individual genome is estimated to be twice that of an ETS in this lineage. Significant gene conversion patterns between two hybridizing taxa were observed in contiguous arrays of cloned ETS-ITS sequences, further confirming that only ITS regions have introgressed bidirectionally. The relatively slow concerted evolution in the ITS regions probably allows the coexistence of multiple alleles within a genome, whereas the strong concerted evolution in the ETS region rapidly eliminates heterogeneous alleles derived from other species, resulting in species delimitations highly concordant with those based on morphology. This finding indicates that the use of multiple molecular tools has the potential to reveal detailed organismal evolution process involving interspecific hybridization, as an individual locus varies greatly in its potential to introgress between species.	2005	10.1093/molbev/msi016		Plants	Saxifragales	Mitella	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (4 genes)	TRUE

Chris	Transcriptome and organellar sequencing highlights the complex origin and diversification of allotetraploid Brassica napus	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS	Brassica napus, an allotetraploid crop, is hypothesized to be a hybrid from unknown varieties of Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. Despite the economic importance of B. napus, much is unresolved regarding its phylogenomic relationships, genetic structure, and diversification. Here we conduct a comprehensive study among diverse accessions from 183 B. napus (including rapeseed, rutabaga, and Siberian kale), 112 B. rapa, and 62 B. oleracea and its wild relatives. Using RNA-seq of B. napus accessions, we define the genetic diversity and sub-genome variance of six genetic clusters. Nuclear and organellar phylogenies for B. napus and its progenitors reveal varying patterns of inheritance and post-formation introgression.

Zhou, Y.; Duvaux, L.; Ren, G.; Zhang, L.; Savolainen, O.; Liu, J.	Importance of incomplete lineage sorting and introgression in the origin of shared genetic variation between two closely related pines with overlapping distributions	HEREDITY	Genetic variation shared between closely related species may be due to retention of ancestral polymorphisms because of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and/or introgression following secondary contact. It is challenging to distinguish ILS and introgression because they generate similar patterns of shared genetic diversity, but this is nonetheless essential for inferring accurately the history of species with overlapping distributions. To address this issue, we sequenced 33 independent intron loci across the genome of two closely related pine species (Pinus massoniana Lamb. and Pinus hwangshanensis Hisa) from Southeast China. Population structure analyses revealed that the species showed slightly more admixture in parapatric populations than in allopatric populations. Levels of interspecific differentiation were lower in parapatry than in allopatry. Approximate Bayesian computation suggested that the most likely speciation scenario explaining this pattern was a long period of isolation followed by a secondary contact. Ecological niche modeling suggested that a gradual range expansion of P. hwangshanensis during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations could have been the cause of the overlap. Our study therefore suggests that secondary introgression, rather than ILS, explains most of the shared nuclear genomic variation between these two species and demonstrates the complementarity of population genetics and ecological niche modeling in understanding gene flow history. Finally, we discuss the importance of contrasting results from markers with different dynamics of migration, namely nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA.	2017	10.1038/hdy.2016.72		Plants	Picea	Pinus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	demography, STRUCTURE	Sanger (37 genes)	TRUE	
Sung, Cheng-Jung; Bell, Katherine L.; Nice, Chris C.; Martin, Noland H.	Integrating Bayesian genomic cline analyses and association mapping of morphological and ecological traits to dissect reproductive isolation and introgression in a Louisiana Iris hybrid zone	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybrid zones provide unique opportunities to examine reproductive isolation and introgression in nature. We utilized 45,384 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci to perform association mapping of 14 floral, vegetative and ecological traits that differ between Iris hexagona and Iris fulva, and to investigate, using a Bayesian genomic cline (BGC) framework, patterns of genomic introgression in a large and phenotypically diverse hybrid zone in southern Louisiana. Many loci of small effect size were consistently found to be associated with phenotypic variation across all traits, and several individual loci were revealed to influence phenotypic variation across multiple traits. Patterns of genomic introgression were quite heterogeneous throughout the Louisiana Iris genome, with I. hexagona alleles tending to be favoured over those of I. fulva. Loci that were found to have exceptional patterns of introgression were also found to be significantly associated with phenotypic variation in a small number of morphological traits. However, this was the exception rather than the rule, as most loci that were associated with morphological trait variation were not significantly associated with excess ancestry. These findings provide insights into the complexity of the genomic architecture of phenotypic differences and are a first step towards identifying loci that are associated with both trait variation and reproductive isolation in nature.	2018	10.1111/mec.14481		Plants	Asparagales	Iris	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	clines, ENTROPY	microarray (45384)	TRUE

Thorsson, AE. Th.; Palsson, S.; Lascoux, M.; Anamthawat-Jonsson, K.	Introgression and phylogeography of Betula nana (diploid), B-pubescens (tetraploid) and their triploid hybrids in Iceland inferred from cpDNA haplotype variation	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY	Aim The objective was to find direct genetic evidence supporting introgressive hybridization between tetraploid tree birch (Betula pubescens) and diploid dwarf birch (B. nana), via triploid hybrids, and to investigate an association between the introgression and phylogeographical distribution of Icelandic birch. Location Samples were collected from 463 trees in 12 woodlands in Iceland and eight locations in Norway, Sweden, Scotland and Greenland. Methods Ploidy status of individual trees was determined by chromosome counting. Variation in the chloroplast genome was assessed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The geographical distribution of the haplotypes was mapped. The haplotype variation and introgression ratios (IG) were analysed statistically. Results Thirteen haplotypes were identified among Icelandic samples. The most common haplotype (T, 49% occurrence) was present in all ploidy groups and in all woodlands. All common haplotypes were shared between the triploid group and the parental species, indicating introgressive hybridization. This was supported by the statistical analysis of IG indices and the variation components. Considerable differences existed among samples, shaped by isolation by distance and local introgression. An east-west phylogeographical distribution in Iceland was observed. Main conclusions Despite extensive introgression across species and ploidy levels, a biogeographical pattern has been observed, and this may indicate different population histories or multiple origins of Icelandic birch. The chloroplast haplotype diversity found in Iceland resembles that found in birch populations from northern Scandinavia.	2010	10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02353.x		Plants	Fagales	Betula	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	RFLP	TRUE	
Aagaard, SMD; Sastad, SM; Greilhuber, J; Moen, A	A secondary hybrid zone between diploid Dactylorhiza incarnata ssp cruenta and allotetraploid D-lapponica (Orchidaceae)	HEREDITY	Secondary hybrid zones are not uncommon in Dactylorhiza, but knowledge of ecological and evolutionary consequences of hybridization are scarce. Here, we assess interploidal gene flow and introgression in a hybrid zone between diploid Dactylorhiza incarnata ssp. cruenta ( 2n = 2x = 40) and its putative allotetraploid derivative D. lapponica ( 2n = 4x = 80). Photometric quantification of DNA content and morphology confirmed that triploids are abundant in sympatric populations in our study area. Allozyme segregation patterns in D. lapponica supported an allopolyploid origin, although unbalanced genotypes suggested rare pairings between homoeologous chromosomes. Photometric data and chromosome counts suggest backcrossing between the triploid hybrid and D. lapponica, and hence some hybrid fertility. Triploids are morphologically more similar to the tetraploids than the diploids, maybe owing to the hybrid origin of both triploids and tetraploids. The diploids and tetraploids were not more similar in the parapatric populations compared to when they occur in allopatry. This indicates that backcrossing rarely leads to introgression, or alternatively that allopatric populations are not isolated enough to prevent influx of pollen from the other species. Despite some evidence of backcrossing, our study gives few indications that widespread hybridization entails local breakdown of species boundaries. Rather, the hybrid zone may be a transient phenomenon due to intensive mowing, resulting in the opening of habitats and hence bringing the parental species into close contact.	2005	10.1038/sj.hdy.6800643		Plants	Asparagales	Dactylorhiza	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	allozymes	TRUE

The speciation and phylogenetic relationships among Chinese Juglans remain unclear. Here, we used results from phylogenomic and population genetic analyses, transcriptomics, Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS), and whole chloroplast genomes (Cp genome) data to infer processes of lineage formation among the five native Chinese species of the walnut genus (Juglans, Juglandaceae), a widespread, economically important group. We found that the processes of isolation generated diversity during glaciations, but that the recent range expansion of J. regia, probably from multiple refugia, led to hybrid formation both within and between sections of the genus. In southern China, human dispersal of J. regia brought it into contact with J. sigillata, which we determined to be an ecotype of J. regia that is now maintained as a landrace. In northern China, walnut hybridized with a distinct lineage of J. mandshurica to form J. hopeiensis, a controversial taxon (considered threatened) that our data indicate is a horticultural variety. Comparisons among whole chloroplast genomes and nuclear transcriptome analyses provided conflicting evidence for the timing of the divergence of Chinese Juglans taxa. J. cathayensis and J. mandshurica are poorly differentiated based our genomic data. Reconstruction of Juglans evolutionary history indicate that episodes of climatic variation over the past 4.5 to 33.80 million years, associated with glacial advances and retreats and population isolation, have shaped Chinese walnut demography and evolution, even in the presence of gene flow and introgression.	2018	10.1016/j.ympev.2018.04.014		Plants	Fagales	Juglans	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	FRAPPE, ADMIXTURE	GBS, transcriptome	TRUE	
Schierenbeck, KA; Symonds, VV; Gallagher, KG; Bell, J	Genetic variation and phylogeographic analyses of two species of Carpobrotus and their hybrids in California	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Despite the commonality and study of hybridization in plants, there are few studies between invasive and noninvasive species that examine the genetic variability and gene flow of cytoplasmic DNA. We describe the phylogeographical structure of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation within and among several interspecific populations of the putative native, Carpobrotus chilensis and the introduced, Carpobrotus edulis (Aizoaceae). These species co-occur throughout much of coastal California and form several 'geographical hybrid populations'. Two hundred and thirty-seven individuals were analysed for variation in an approximate 7.0 kb region of the chloroplast genome using PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism) data. Phylogenetic analyses and cpDNA population differentiation were conducted for all morphotypes. Historic geographical dispersion and the coefficient of ancestry of the haplotypes were determined using nested clade analyses. Two haplotypic groupings (1 and 11) were represented in C. chilensis and C. edulis, respectively. The variation in cpDNA data is in agreement with the previously reported allozyme and morphological data, this supports relatively limited variation and high population differentiation among C. chilensis and hybrids and more wide-ranging variation in C. edulis and C. edulis populations backcrossed with C. chilensis. C. chilensis disproportionately contributes to the creation of hybrids with the direction of gene flow from C. chilensis into C. edulis. The cpDNA data support C. chilensis as the maternal contributor to the hybrid populations.	2005	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02417.x		Plants	Caryophyllales	Carpobrotus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity, trees	RFLP	TRUE	
Lexer, C; Fay, MF; Joseph, JA; Nica, MS; Heinze, B	Barrier to gene flow between two ecologically divergent Populus species, P alba (white poplar) and P tremula (European aspen): the role of ecology and life history in gene introgression	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The renewed interest in the use of hybrid zones for studying speciation calls for the identification and study of hybrid zones across a wide range of organisms, especially in long-lived taxa for which it is often difficult to generate interpopulation variation through controlled crosses. Here, we report on the extent and direction of introgression between two members of the 'model tree' genus Populus: Populus alba (white poplar) and Populus tremula (European aspen), across a large zone of sympatry located in the Danube valley. We genotyped 93 hybrid morphotypes and samples from four parental reference populations from within and outside the zone of sympatry for a genome-wide set of 20 nuclear microsatellites and eight plastid DNA restriction site polymorphisms. Our results indicate that introgression occurs preferentially from P. tremula to P. alba via P. tremula pollen. This unidirectional pattern is facilitated by high levels of pollen vs. seed dispersal in P. tremula (pollen/seed flow = 23.9) and by great ecological opportunity in the lowland floodplain forest in proximity to P. alba seed parents, which maintains gene flow in the direction of P. alba despite smaller effective population sizes (N-e) in this species (P. alba N(e)c. 500-550; P. tremula N(e)c. 550-700). Our results indicate that hybrid zones will be valuable tools for studying the genetic architecture of the barrier to gene flow between these two ecologically divergent Populus species.	2005	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02469.x		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity, demography	microsattelites (20)	TRUE	
Gramlich, Susanne; Wagner, Natascha Dorothea; Hoerandl, Elvira	RAD-seq reveals genetic structure of the F-2-generation of natural willow hybrids (Salix L.) and a great potential for interspecific introgression	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	BackgroundHybridization of species with porous genomes can eventually lead to introgression via repeated backcrossing. The potential for introgression between species is reflected by the extent of segregation distortion in later generation hybrids. Here we studied a population of hybrids between Salix purpurea and S. helvetica that has emerged within the last 30years on a glacier forefield in the European Alps due to secondary contact of the parental species. We used 5758 biallelic SNPs produced by RAD sequencing with the aim to ascertain the predominance of backcrosses (F-1 hybrid x parent) or F-2 hybrids (F-1 hybrid x F-1 hybrid) among hybrid offspring. Further, the SNPs were used to study segregation distortion in the second hybrid generation.ResultsThe analyses in structure and NewHybrids revealed that the population consisted of parents and F-1 hybrids, whereas hybrid offspring consisted mainly of backcrosses to either parental species, but also some F-2 hybrids. Although there was a clear genetic differentiation between S. purpurea and S. helvetica (F-ST=0.24), there was no significant segregation distortion in the backcrosses or the F-2 hybrids. Plant height of the backcrosses resembled the respective parental species, whereas F-2 hybrids were more similar to the subalpine S. helvetica.ConclusionsThe co-occurrence of the parental species and the hybrids on the glacier forefield, the high frequency of backcrossing, and the low resistance to gene flow via backcrossing make a scenario of introgression in this young hybrid population highly likely, potentially leading to the transfer of adaptive traits. We further suggest that this willow hybrid population may serve as a model for the evolutionary processes initiated by recent global warming.	2018	10.1186/s12870-018-1552-6		Plants	Malpighiales	Salix	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, MIGRATE	RAD (5785 loci)	TRUE	
Cho, Ara; Baek, Seunghoon; Kim, Goon-Bo; Shin, Chang-Ho; Kim, Chan-Soo; Choi, Kyung; Kang, Youngje; Yu, Hee-Ju; Kim, Joo-Hwan; Mun, Jeong-Hwan	Genomic clues to the parental origin of the wild flowering cherry Prunus yedoensis var. nudiflora (Rosaceae)	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY REPORTS	Prunus yedoensis Matsumura is one of the popular ornamental flowering cherry trees native to northeastern Asia, and its wild populations have only been found on Jeju Island, Korea. Previous studies suggested that wild P. yedoensis (P. yedoensis var. nudiflora) is a hybrid species; however, there is no solid evidence on its exact parental origin and genomic organization. In this study, we developed a total of 38 nuclear gene-based DNA markers that can be universally amplifiable in the Prunus species using 586 Prunus Conserved Orthologous Gene Set (Prunus COS). Using the Prunus COS markers, we investigated the genetic structure of wild P. yedoensis populations and evaluated the putative parental species of wild P. yedoensis. Population structure and phylogenetic analysis of 73 wild P. yedoensis accessions and 54 accessions of other Prunus species revealed that the wild P. yedoensis on Jeju Island is a natural homoploid hybrid. Sequence-level comparison of Prunus COS markers between species suggested that wild P. yedoensis might originate from a cross between maternal P. pendula f. ascendens and paternal P. jamasakura. Moreover, approximately 81% of the wild P. yedoensis accessions examined were likely F1 hybrids, whereas the remaining 19% were backcross hybrids resulting from additional asymmetric introgression of parental genotypes. These findings suggest that complex hybridization of the Prunus species on Jeju Island can produce a range of variable hybrid offspring. Overall, this study makes a significant contribution to address issues of the origin, nomenclature, and genetic relationship of ornamental P. yedoensis.	2017	10.1007/s11816-017-0465-4		Plants	Rosales	Prunus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, MIGRATE, trees	Sanger (38 markers)	TRUE	
de Lafontaine, Guillaume; Bousquet, Jean	Asymmetry matters: A genomic assessment of directional biases in gene flow between hybridizing spruces	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Assessing directional bias in interspecific gene flow might be important in determining the evolutionary trajectory of closely related species pairs. Using a set of 300 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) having variable propensity to cross species boundary, we evaluated the genomic extent and direction of interspecific gene flow in a progenitor-derivative spruce species pair (black spruce and red spruce). A higher rate of gene flow was found from black spruce toward red spruce purebreds than vice versa. This asymmetry could reflect the historical gene flow between the two taxa at the time of species inception and during postglacial colonization. A clear asymmetry in introgression was depicted by a greater gene flow between red spruce and hybrids than between black spruce and hybrids. While backcrossing toward red spruce was invariably high across the genome, the actual species boundary is between hybrids and black spruce where gene flow is impeded at those genomic regions impermeable to introgression. Associations between hybrid index and climatic variables (total annual precipitation and mean annual temperature) were tested, as these might indicate a role for exogenous selection in maintaining the species boundary. While an apparent association was found between the hybrid index and precipitation, it collapsed when considered in light of the directional bias in interspecific gene flow. Hence, considering asymmetrical patterns of introgression allowed us to falsify an apparent role for exogenous selection. Although this was not formerly tested here, we suggest that this pattern could result from asymmetrical endogenous selection, a contention that deserves further investigations.	2017	10.1002/ece3.2682		Plants	Pinales	Picea	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, MIGRATE	microarray (300 loci)	TRUE

Improvement efforts are often hindered by limited knowledge of diversity contained within available germplasm. Here, we employ genotyping-by-sequencing to investigate a diverse panel of 85 landrace and improved B. oleracea broccoli, cauliflower, and Chinese kale entries. Ultimately, 21,680 high-quality SNPs were used to reveal a complex and admixed population structure and clarify phylogenetic relationships among B. oleracea groups. Each broccoli landrace contained, on average, 8.4 times as many unique alleles as an improved broccoli and landraces collectively represented 81% of all broccoli-specific alleles. Commercial broccoli hybrids were largely represented by a single subpopulation identified within a complex population structure. Greater allelic diversity in landrace broccoli and 96.1% of SNPs differentiating improved cauliflower from landrace cauliflower were common to the larger pool of broccoli germplasm, supporting a parallel or later development of cauliflower due to introgression events from broccoli. Chinese kale was readily distinguished by principal coordinate analysis. Genotyping was accomplished with and without reliance upon a reference genome producing 141,317 and 20,815 filtered SNPs, respectively, supporting robust SNP discovery methods in neglected or unimproved crop groups that lack a reference genome. This work clarifies the population structure, phylogeny, and domestication footprints of landrace and improved B. oleracea broccoli using many genotyping-by-sequencing markers. Additionally, a large pool of genetic diversity contained in broccoli landraces is described which may enhance future breeding efforts.	2018	10.1038/s41438-018-0040-3		Plants	Brassicales	Brassica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, CLUMP, trees	GBS	TRUE	
Zeng, Yan-Fei; Zhang, Jian-Guo; Duan, Ai-Guo; Abuduhamiti, Bawerjan	Genetic structure of Populus hybrid zone along the Irtysh River provides insight into plastid-nuclear incompatibility	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	In plants, the maintenance of species integrity despite hybridization has often been explained by the co-adaption of nuclear gene complexes. However, the interaction between plastid and nuclear sub-genomes has been underestimated. Here, we analyzed the genetic structure of a Populus alba and P. tremula hybrid zone along the Irtysh River system in the Altai region, northwest China, using both nuclear microsatellites and plastid DNA sequences. We found high interspecific differentiation, although the hybrid P. x canescens was prevalent. Bayesian inference classified most hybrids into F1, followed by a few back-crosses to P. alba, and fewer F2 hybrids and back-crosses to P. tremula, indicating a few introgressions but preference toward P. alba. When plastid haplotypes in parental species were distinct, P. x canescens carried the haplotypes of both parents, but showed significant linkage between intraspecific haplotype and nuclear genotypes at several microsatellite loci. Selection, rather than migration and assortative mating, might have contributed to such plastid-nuclear disequilibria. By removing later-generated hybrids carrying interspecific combinations of haplotype and nuclear genotypes, plastid-nuclear incompatibility has greatly limited the gene exchange between P. alba and P. tremula via backcrossing with hybrids, demonstrating a significant association between plastid haplotype and the proportion of nuclear admixture.	2016	10.1038/srep28043		Plants	Malpighiales	Populus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, PCA	microsattelites	TRUE

Worldwide relationships in the fern genus Pteridium (bracken) based on nuclear genome markers	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise Spore-bearing plants are capable of dispersing very long distances. However, it is not known if gene flow can prevent genetic divergence in widely distributed taxa. Here we address this issue, and examine systematic relationships at a global geographic scale for the fern genus Pteridium. Methods We sampled plants from 100 localities worldwide, and generated nucleotide data from four nuclear genes and two plastid regions. We also examined 2801 single nucleotide polymorphisms detected by a restriction site-associated DNA approach. Results We found evidence for two distinct diploid species and two allotetraploids between them. The "northern" species (Pteridium aquilinum) has distinct groups at the continental scale (Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America). The northern European subspecies pinetorum appears to involve admixture among all of these. A sample from the Hawaiian Islands contained elements of both North American and Asian P. aquilinum. The "southern" species, P. esculentum, shows little genetic differentiation between South American and Australian samples. Components of African genotypes are detected on all continents. Conclusions We find evidence of distinct continental-scale genetic differentiation in Pteridium. However, on top of this is a clear signal of recent hybridization. Thus, spore-bearing plants are clearly capable of extensive long-distance gene flow; yet appear to have differentiated genetically at the continental scale. Either gene flow in the past was at a reduced level, or vicariance is possible even in the face of long-distance gene flow.	2019	10.1002/ajb2.1365		Plants	Polypodiales	Pteridium	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	ENTROPY, STRUCTURE	amplicons	TRUE

Maintaining their genetic distance: Little evidence for introgression between widely hybridizing species of Geum with contrasting mating systems	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Within the plant kingdom, many genera contain sister lineages with contrasting outcrossing and inbreeding mating systems that are known to hybridize. The evolutionary fate of these sister lineages is likely to be influenced by the extent to which they exchange genes. We measured gene flow between outcrossing Geum rivale and selfing Geum urbanum, sister species that hybridize in contemporary populations. We generated and used a draft genome of G.urbanum to develop dd-RAD data scorable in both species. Coalescent analysis of RAD data from allopatric populations indicated that the species diverged 2-3 Mya, and that historical gene flow between them was extremely low (1 migrant every 25 generations). Comparison of genetic divergence between species in sympatry and allopatry, together with an analysis of allele frequencies in potential parental and hybrid populations, provided no evidence of contemporary introgression in sympatric populations. Cluster- and species-specific marker analyses revealed that, apart from four early-generation hybrids, individuals in sympatric populations fell into two genetically distinct groups that corresponded exactly to their morphological species classification with maximum individual admixture estimates of only 1-3%. However, we did observe joint segregation of four putatively introgressed SNPs across two scaffolds in the G.urbanum population that was associated with significant morphological variation, interpreted as tentative evidence for rare, recent interspecific gene flow. Overall, our results indicate that despite the presence of hybrids in contemporary populations, genetic exchange between G. rivale and G. urbanum has been extremely limited throughout their evolutionary history.	2018	10.1111/mec.14426		Plants	Rosales	Geum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	f3, demography, fastSTRUCTURE	RAD	TRUE

Genomic islands of divergence are not affected by geography of speciation in sunflowers	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS	Genomic studies of speciation often report the presence of highly differentiated genomic regions interspersed within a milieu of weakly diverged loci. The formation of these speciation islands is generally attributed to reduced inter-population gene flow near loci under divergent selection, but few studies have critically evaluated this hypothesis. Here, we report on transcriptome scans among four recently diverged pairs of sunflower (Helianthus) species that vary in the geographical context of speciation. We find that genetic divergence is lower in sympatric and parapatric comparisons, consistent with a role for gene flow in eroding neutral differences. However, genomic islands of divergence are numerous and small in all comparisons, and contrary to expectations, island number and size are not significantly affected by levels of interspecific gene flow. Rather, island formation is strongly associated with reduced recombination rates. Overall, our results indicate that the functional architecture of genomes plays a larger role in shaping genomic divergence than does the geography of speciation.	2013	10.1038/ncomms2833		Plants	Asterales	Helianthus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	transcriptome	TRUE

Sobel, James M.; Streisfeld, Matthew A.	Strong premating reproductive isolation drives incipient speciation in Mimulus aurantiacus	EVOLUTION	Determining which forms of reproductive isolation have the biggest impact on the process of divergence is a major goal of speciation research. These barriers are often divided into those that affect the potential for hybridization (premating isolation), and those that occur after mating (postmating isolation), and much debate has surrounded the relative importance of these categories. Within the species Mimulus aurantiacus, red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes occur in the southwest corner of California, and a hybrid zone occurs where their ranges overlap. We show that premating barriers are exclusively responsible for isolation in this system, with both ecogeographic and pollinator isolation contributing significantly to total isolation. Postmating forms of reproductive isolation have little or no impact on gene flow, indicating that hybrids likely contribute to introgression at neutral loci. Analysis of molecular variation across thousands of restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) markers reveals that the genomes of these taxa are largely undifferentiated. However, structure analysis shows that these taxa are distinguishable genetically, likely due to the impact of loci underlying differentiated adaptive phenotypes. These data exhibit the power of divergent natural selection to maintain highly differentiated phenotypes in the face of gene flow during the early stages of speciation.	2015	10.1111/evo.12589		Plants	Lamiales	Mimulus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE	RAD	TRUE	
Kenney, Amanda M.; Sweigart, Andrea L.	Reproductive isolation and introgression between sympatric Mimulus species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Incompletely isolated species provide an opportunity to investigate the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces that maintain distinct species in the face of ongoing gene flow. Here, we use field surveys and reduced representation sequencing to characterize the patterns of reproductive isolation, admixture and genomic divergence between populations of the outcrossing wildflower Mimulus guttatus and selfing M. nasutus. Focusing on a single site where these two species have come into secondary contact, we find that phenological isolation is strong, although incomplete, and is likely driven by divergence in response to photoperiod. In contrast to previous field studies, which have suggested that F-1-hybrid formation might be rare, we discover patterns of genomic variation consistent with ongoing introgression. Strikingly, admixed individuals vary continuously from highly admixed to nearly pure M. guttatus, demonstrating ongoing hybridization and asymmetric introgression from M. nasutus into M. guttatus. Patterns of admixture and divergence across the genome show that levels of introgression are more variable than expected by chance. Some genomic regions show a reduced introgression, including one region that overlaps a critical photoperiod QTL, whereas other regions show elevated levels of interspecific gene flow. In addition, we observe a genome-wide negative relationship between absolute divergence and the local recombination rate, potentially indicating natural selection against M. nasutus ancestry in M. guttatus genetic backgrounds. Together, our results suggest that Mimulus speciation is both ongoing and dynamic and that a combination of divergence in phenology and mating system, as well as selection against interspecific alleles, likely maintains these sympatric species.	2016	10.1111/mec.13630		Plants	Lamiales	Mimulus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, sequence similarity	GBS	TRUE

The investigation of hybridisation along elevational gradients, with their steep abiotic and biotic clines, provides insight into the adaptation and maintenance of species in adjacent habitats.

In the present study, we used AFLP fingerprinting of 689 individuals from 38 populations to analyse population structure and introgression patterns along four elevational transects (650-1350 m) in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Gemany. Subsequently, we searched for loci putatively under divergent selection that may maintain 'pure' species despite hybrid formation by identifying taxon-specific alleles. A maximum-likelihood based hybrid index shows that the overall genetic differentiation among all populations was very low with a vanishingly small number of pure parental individuals. Almost 75% of the investigated individuals were classified as backcrosses towards S. ovatus. The highest S. hercynicus ancestry was found in the uppermost populations of two transects. Further, we found seven taxon-specific alleles being under divergent selection that correlated with climatic variables and deviating from neutral introgression. According to our results, hybridisation of S. ovatus and S. hercynicus has reached an advanced state of genetic swamping and there seems to be no driving force that is strong enough to keep both species as different lineages. Rather, S. ovatus appears to benefit through putatively adaptive introgression.	2017	10.1007/s10682-017-9890-7		Plants	Asterales	Senecio	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	STRUCTURE, INTROGRESS	RFLP	TRUE

Healey, Adam; Lee, David J.; Furtado, Agnelo; Henry, Robert J.	Evidence of inter-sectional chloroplast capture in Corymbia among sections Torellianae and Maculatae	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Chloroplast capture through hybridisation and introgression is well described within Eucalyptus. Despite the propensity of the Cotymbia genus (eucalypts) to form hybrids from wide crosses, description of chloroplast capture in Corymbia has, until recently, been limited. In this study our aim was to investigate evidence of intersectional chloroplast capture between sections Torellianae and Maculatae. Using whole-genome next-generation sequencing data, the complete chloroplast genomes were assembled from four Corymbia taxa: Corymbia citriodora subspecies citriodora (Hook.) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson, Corymbia citriodora subspecies variegata (F.Muell.) A.R.Bean & M.W. McDonald, Corymbia henryi (S.T.Blake) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson, and Corymbia torelliana (F.Muell.) K.D.Hill & L.A. S.Johnson, represented by eight genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison among Corymbia chloroplast genomes and nuclear external transcribed spacer (ETS) sequences revealed chloroplast capture among Corymbia species across distinct sections Torellianae and Maculatae within subgenus Blakella. Reticulate evolution, along with Eucalyptus, likely extends into Corymbia as evidenced by incongruent plastid and nuclear phylogenetic trees, suggestive of its importance of hybridisation and introgression during the evolution of eucalypts.	2018	10.1071/BT18028		Plants	Myrtales	Corymbia	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger	TRUE	
Singh, Narinder; Wu, Shuangye; Tiwari, Vijay; Sehgal, Sunish; Raupp, John; Wilson, Duane; Abbasov, Mehraj; Gill, Bikram; Poland, Jesse	Genomic Analysis Confirms Population Structure and Identifies Inter-Lineage Hybrids in Aegilops tauschii	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a storehouse of genetic diversity, and an important resource for future wheat improvement. Genomic and population analysis of 549 Ae. tauschii and 103 wheat accessions was performed by using 13,135 high quality SNPs. Population structure, principal component, and cluster analysis confirmed the differentiation of Ae. tauschii into two lineages; lineage 1 (L1) and lineage 2 (L2), the latter being the wheat D-genome donor. Lineage L1 contributes only 2.7% of the total introgression from Ae. tauschii for a set of United States winter wheat lines, confirming the great amount of untapped genetic diversity in L1. Lineage L2 accessions had overall greater allelic diversity and wheat accessions had the least allelic diversity. Both lineages also showed intra-lineage differentiation with L1 being driven by longitudinal gradient and L2 differentiated by altitude. There has previously been little reported on natural hybridization between L1 and L2. We found nine putative inter-lineage hybrids in the population structure analysis, each containing numerous lineage-specific private alleles from both lineages. One hybrid was confirmed as a recombinant inbred between the two lineages, likely artificially post collection. Of the remaining eight putative hybrids, a group of seven from Georgia carry 713 SNPs with private alleles, which points to the possibility of a novel L1-L2 hybrid lineage. To facilitate the use of Ae. tauschii in wheat improvement, a MiniCore consisting of 29 L1 and 11 L2 accessions, has been developed based on genotypic, phenotypic and geographical data. MiniCore reduces the collection size by over 10-fold and captures 84% of the total allelic diversity in the whole collection.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.00009		Plants	Poales	Aegilops	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	fastStructure, Sequence similarity	GBS (318000 loci)	TRUE	
Warwick, S. I.; Legere, A.; Simard, M. -J.; James, T.	Do escaped transgenes persist in nature? The case of an herbicide resistance transgene in a weedy Brassica rapa population	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The existence of transgenic hybrids resulting from transgene escape from genetically modified (GM) crops to wild or weedy relatives is well documented but the fate of the transgene over time in recipient wild species populations is still relatively unknown. This is the first report of the persistence and apparent introgression, i.e. stable incorporation of genes from one differentiated gene pool into another, of an herbicide resistance transgene from Brassica napus into the gene pool of its weedy relative, Brassica rapa, monitored under natural commercial field conditions. Hybridization between glyphosate-resistant [herbicide resistance (HR)] B. napus and B. rapa was first observed at two Quebec sites, Ste Agathe and St Henri, in 2001. B. rapa populations at these two locations were monitored in 2002, 2003 and 2005 for the presence of hybrids and transgene persistence. Hybrid numbers decreased over the 3-year period, from 85 out of similar to 200 plants surveyed in 2002 to only five out of 200 plants in 2005 (St Henri site). Most hybrids had the HR trait, reduced male fertility, intermediate genome structure, and presence of both species-specific amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. Both F-1 and backcross hybrid generations were detected. One introgressed individual, i.e. with the HR trait and diploid ploidy level of B. rapa, was observed in 2005. The latter had reduced pollen viability but produced similar to 480 seeds. Forty-eight of the 50 progeny grown from this plant were diploid with high pollen viability and 22 had the transgene (1:1 segregation). These observations confirm the persistence of the HR trait over time. Persistence occurred over a 6-year period, in the absence of herbicide selection pressure (with the exception of possible exposure to glyphosate in 2002), and in spite of the fitness cost associated with hybridization.	2008	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03567.x		Plants	Brassicales	Brassica	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	AFLP	TRUE	
Urfusova, Romana; Mahelka, Vaclav; Krahulec, Frantisek; Urfus, Tomas	Evidence of widespread hybridization among couch grasses (Elymus, Poaceae)	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Hybridization, polyploidization, and crop-to-wild gene transfer within the agriculturally important tribe Triticeae are well explored experimentally, but the true consequences of both phenomena under natural conditions remain understudied. The present paper reports on an investigation of three species of couch grasses (Elymus hispidus, E. repens, and E. caninus) examining the ploidy levels and absolute genome sizes (1081 plants from 302 natural populations in Central Europe, verified by chromosome counts) and their morphological delimitation. In the present study, the hexaploid level prevailed in E. hispidus and E. repens whereas E. caninus was exclusively tetraploid. Introgressive hybridization between hexaploid species, unidirectionally shifted towards E. hispidus, was indicated by a continual pattern of genome size values. We did not find any evidence for heteroploid hybridization involving tetraploid E. caninus; however, we detected minority cytotypes among both E. caninus plants (hexaploid) and E. repens-E. hispidus hybrids (heptaploid and nonaploid) suggesting the formation of unreduced gametes. Morphometric results (367 plants, redundancy analysis, principal component analysis, and correlation analysis) mirrored the continual homoploid pattern of absolute genome size (including the unidirectional shift), and a significant correlation between absolute genome size and morphology was confirmed. Moreover, morphometric analyses detected additional characteristics for the delimitation of the Elymus taxa under study. Considering the crossability of E. hispidus with Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), the revealed extent of introgressive hybridization has implications for assessing the potential risk of gene flow between crops and troublesome weeds.		10.1111/jse.12563		Plants	Poales	Elymus	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	sequence similarity	genome size	TRUE

Friar, Elizabeth A.; Prince, Linda M.; Cruse-Sanders, Jennifer M.; McGlaughlin, Mitchell E.; Butterworth, Charles A.; Baldwin, Bruce G.	Hybrid origin and genomic mosaicism of Dubautia scabra (Hawaiian Silversword Alliance; Asteraceae, Madiinae)	SYSTEMATIC BOTANY	Incongruence among different estimates of species relationships in plants, from different molecules, cytogenetic data, biogeographic data, morphological/anatomical data or other sources, has been used frequently as an indication of introgression, hybrid species origin, or chloroplast (cp) capture. In plants, these incongruences are most often seen between data derived from the nuclear vs. the cp genomes and the nuclear markers used for comparison usually have been from the nuclear ribosomal (nr) internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). The amount of genomic material shared between introgressing species can be highly variable. In some of these cases, other nuclear genomic regions have moved between species without leaving a signature on the nrITS. An example of well-supported phylogenetic incongruence is the placement of Dubautia scabra (D.C.) D.D. Kech in the Hawaiian silversword alliance (HSA); evolutionary hypotheses for D. scabra based on molecular as opposed to cytogenetic data are strongly discordant. In this paper, we test these two conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses regarding the evolutionary relationships of Dubautia scabra using evidence from six low-copy nuclear genes, as well as multiple chloroplast noncoding regions and nrITS. The nrITS region is also examined for the presence of multiple copy types. Incongruence between inferred relationships based on nuclear chromosomal arrangements and molecular phylogenetic data from chloroplast DNA and nrITS is resolved in favor of a hypothesis of ancient hybridization rather than cytogenetic homoplasy involving dysploidy. Most single-copy nuclear genes track histories of D. scabra compatible with cylogenetic data whereas chloroplast and nrIT data track a common, different history that appears to reflect hybridization with a chromosomally distinct lineage that also occurs on Maui Nui and Hawaii (the Big Island).	2008	10.1600/036364408785679815		Plants	Asterales	Dubautia	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees	Sanger (30)	TRUE	
Huynh, Stella; Marcussen, Thomas; Felber, Francois; Parisod, Christian	Hybridization preceded radiation in diploid wheats	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Evolutionary relationships among the Aegilops-Triticum relatives of cultivated wheats have been difficult to resolve owing to incomplete lineage sorting and reticulate evolution. Recent studies have suggested that the wheat D-genome lineage (progenitor of Ae. tauschii) originated through homoploid hybridization between the A-genome lineage (progenitor of Triticum s.str.) and the B-genome lineage (progenitor of Ae. speltoides). This scenario of reticulation has been debated, calling for adequate phylogenetic analyses based on comprehensive sampling. To reconstruct the evolution of Aegilops-Triticum diploids, we here combined high-throughput sequencing of 38 nuclear low-copy loci of multiple accessions of all 13 species with inferences of the species phylogeny using the full-parameterized MCMC_SEQ method. Phylogenies recovered a monophyletic Aegilops-Triticum lineage that began diversifying similar to 6.6 Ma ago and gave rise to four sublineages, i.e. the A- (2 species), B-(1 species), D- (9 species) and T- (Ae. mutica) genome lineage. Full-parameterized phylogenies as well as patterns of tree dilation and tree compression supported a hybrid origin of the D-genome lineage from A and B similar to 3.0-4.0 Ma ago, and did not indicate additional hybridization events. Conflicting ABBA-BABA tests suggestive of further reticulation were shown here to result from ancestral population structure rather than hybridization. This comprehensive and dated phylogeny of wheat relatives indicates that the origin of the hybrid D-genome was followed by intense diversification into the majority of extant diploid as well as allopolyploid wild wheats.	2019	10.1016/j.ympev.2019.106554		Plants	Poales	Aegilops, Triticum	TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest	TRUE	trees, sequence similarity	Sanger (48 loci)	TRUE

Barbanera, Filippo; Guerrini, Monica; Bertoncini, Franco; Cappelli, Fabio; Muzzeddu, Marco; Dini, Fernando	Sequenced RAPD markers to detect hybridization in the barbary partridge (Alectoris barbara, Phasianidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	In the Alectoris partridges (Phasianidae), hybridization occurs occasionally as a result of the natural breakdown of isolating mechanisms but more frequently as a result of human activity. No genetic record of hybridization is known for the barbary partridge (A. barbara). This species is distributed mostly in North Africa and, in Europe, on the island of Sardinia (Italy) and on Gibraltar. The risk of hybridization between barbary and red-legged partridge (A. rufa: Iberian Peninsula, France, Italy) is high in Sardinia and in Spain. We developed two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to detect A. barbara x A. rufa hybrid partridges. We tested them on 125 experimental hybrids, sequenced the relative species-specific bands and found that the bands and their corresponding sequences were reliably transmitted through a number of generations (F1, F2, F3, BC1, BC2). Our markers represent a highly valuable tool for the preservation of the A. barbara genome from the pressing threat of A. rufa pollution.	2011	10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02880.x		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	method to detect hybrids	FALSE			FALSE	
Bay, Rachael A.; Ruegg, Kristen	Genomic islands of divergence or opportunities for introgression?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	In animals, introgression between species is often perceived as the breakdown of reproductive isolating mechanisms, but gene flow between incipient species can also represent a source for potentially beneficial alleles. Recently, genome-wide datasets have revealed clusters of differentiated loci ('genomic islands of divergence') that are thought to play a role in reproductive isolation and therefore have reduced gene flow. We use simulations to further examine the evolutionary forces that shape and maintain genomic islands of divergence between two subspecies of the migratory songbird, Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), which have come into secondary contact since the last glacial maximum. We find that, contrary to expectation, gene flow is high within islands and is highly asymmetric. In addition, patterns of nucleotide diversity at highly differentiated loci suggest selection was more frequent in a single ecotype. We propose a mechanism whereby beneficial alleles spread via selective sweeps following a post-glacial demographic expansion in one subspecies and move preferentially across the hybrid zone. We find no evidence that genomic islands are the result of divergent selection or reproductive isolation, rather our results suggest that differentiated loci both within and outside islands could provide opportunities for adaptive introgression across porous species boundaries.	2017	10.1098/rspb.2016.2414		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	no introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Colston-Nepali, Lila; Tigano, Anna; Boyle, Brian; Friesen, Vicki		CONSERVATION GENETICS	Hybridization can negatively impact one or both taxa involved and therefore pose conservation concerns. Climate change is expected to increase the rate of hybridization particularly in polar regions, and so investigating hybridization in Arctic and Antarctic species is important for conservation. Hybridization and genetic introgression have been observed between Pacific populations of thick-billed (Uria lomvia) and common murres (Uria aalge), species of seabirds with arctic and low arctic/temperate distributions, respectively. We employed double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to generate thousands of genome-wide markers to investigate hybridization and introgression in 133 thick-billed and 119 common murres sampled from 15 colonies throughout the North Atlantic. We used molecular assignments and principal components analysis to identify hybrids and quantify genetic introgression. Despite previous reports of hybridization between murre species in the Atlantic, we found no evidence for hybrid individuals in our dataset, and limited evidence for introgression. Our results suggest that hybridization between Atlantic murre species is rare, and does not currently pose a conservation concern for either species. Our study provides baseline data for monitoring hybridization between murres in the Atlantic to assess future impacts of climate change on these species.	2019	10.1007/s10592-019-01223-y		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE

However the advantages of the most commonly used tools are strongly limited in non-model organisms, including wild birds. In this study we attempt to test the utility of genotyping by sequencing (GBS) without relying on the reference genome sequence in selected pairs of sibling bird species that are known to hybridize (Syrian and Great Spotted Woodpeckers). We found that GBS is able to produce a satisfying number of polymorphisms and can be successfully applied to the population genetics of these species. The results also suggest that urban populations of these woodpeckers, especially phenotypic Syrian Woodpeckers, consist of individuals that harbor genotypes assigned to Great Spotted Woodpeckers, which suggests intensive hybridization and introgression.	2019	10.1007/s10336-018-1601-9		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	methods paper	FALSE			FALSE	
Kartout-Benmessaoud, Yasmine; Ladjali-Mohammedi, Kafia	Banding cytogenetics of chimeric hybrids Coturnix coturnix x Coturnix japonica and comparative analysis with the domestic fowl	COMPARATIVE CYTOGENETICS	The Common quail Coturnix coturnix Linnaeus, 1758 is a wild migratory bird which is distributed in Eurasia and North Africa, everywhere with an accelerating decline in population size. This species is protected by the Bonn and Berne conventions (1979) and by annex II/I of the Birds Directive (2009). In Algeria, its breeding took place at the hunting centre in the west of the country. Breeding errors caused uncontrolled crosses between the Common quail and Japanese quail Coturnix japonica Temminck & Schlegel, 1849. In order to help to preserve the natural genetic heritage of the Common quail and to lift the ambiguity among the populations of quail raised in Algeria, it seemed essential to begin to describe the chromosomes of this species in the country since no cytogenetic study has been reported to date. Fibroblast cultures from embryo and adult animal were initiated. Double synchronization with excess thymidine allowed us to obtain high resolution chromosomes blocked at prometaphase stage. The karyotype and the idiogram in GTG morphological banding (G-bands obtained with tlypsin and Giemsa) corresponding to larger chromosomes 1-12 and ZW pair were thus established. The diploid set of chromosomes was estimated as 2N=78. Cytogenetic analysis of expected hybrid animals revealed the presence of a genetic introgression and cellular chimerism. This technique is effective in distinguishing the two quail taxa. Furthermore, the comparative chromosomal analysis of the two quails and domestic chicken Gallus gallus domesticto Linnaeus, 1758 has been conducted. Differences in morphology and/or GTG band motifs were observed on 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 and W chromosomes. Neocentromere occurrence was suggested for Common quail chromosome 1 and Chicken chromosomes 4 and W. Double pericentric inversion was observed on the Common quail chromosome 2 while pericentric inversion hypothesis was proposed for Chicken chromosome 8. A deletion on the short arm of the Common quail chromosome 7 was also found. These results suggest that Common quail would be a chromosomally intermediate species between Chicken and Japanese quail. The appearance of only a few intrachromosomal rearrangements that occurred during evolution suggests that the organization of the genome is highly conserved between these three galliform species.	2018	10.3897/CompCytogen.v12i4.27341		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	Cytogenetic comparison	FALSE			FALSE	
Kovach, Adrienne I.; Walsh, Jennifer; Ramsdell, Jordan; Thomas, W. Kelley	Development of diagnostic microsatellite markers from whole-genome sequences of Ammodramus sparrows for assessing admixture in a hybrid zone	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Studies of hybridization and introgression and, in particular, the identification of admixed individuals in natural populations benefit from the use of diagnostic genetic markers that reliably differentiate pure species from each other and their hybrid forms. Such diagnostic markers are often infrequent in the genomes of closely related species, and genomewide data facilitate their discovery. We used whole-genome data from Illumina HiSeqS2000 sequencing of two recently diverged (600,000years) and hybridizing, avian, sister species, the Saltmarsh (Ammodramus caudacutus) and Nelson's (A. nelsoni) Sparrow, to develop a suite of diagnostic markers for high-resolution identification of pure and admixed individuals. We compared the microsatellite repeat regions identified in the genomes of the two species and selected a subset of 37 loci that differed between the species in repeat number. We screened these loci on 12 pure individuals of each species and report on the 34 that successfully amplified. From these, we developed a panel of the 12 most diagnostic loci, which we evaluated on 96 individuals, including individuals from both allopatric populations and sympatric individuals from the hybrid zone. Using simulations, we evaluated the power of the marker panel for accurate assignments of individuals to their appropriate pure species and hybrid genotypic classes (F1, F2, and backcrosses). The markers proved highly informative for species discrimination and had high accuracy for classifying admixed individuals into their genotypic classes. These markers will aid future investigations of introgressive hybridization in this system and aid conservation efforts aimed at monitoring and preserving pure species. Our approach is transferable to other study systems consisting of closely related and incipient species.	2015	10.1002/ece3.1514		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	hybrid detection methods	FALSE			FALSE

Manthey, Joseph D.; Boissinot, Stephane; Moyle, Robert G.	Biodiversity genomics of North American Dryobates woodpeckers reveals little gene flow across the D. nuttallii x D. scalaris contact zone	AUK	Evolutionary biologists have long used behavioral, ecological, and genetic data from contact zones between closely related species to study various phases of the speciation continuum. North America has several concentrations of avian contact zones, where multiple pairs of sister lineages meet, with or without hybridization. In a southern California contact zone, 2 species of woodpeckers, Nuttall's Woodpecker (Dryobates nuttallii) and the Ladder-backed Woodpecker (D. scalaris), occasionally hybridize. We sampled these 2 species in a transect across this contact zone and included samples of their closest relative, the Downy Woodpecker (D. pubescens), to obtain large single nucleotide polymorphism panels using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Furthermore, we used whole-genome resequencing data for 2 individuals per species to identify whether patterns of diversity inferred from RAD-seq were representative of whole-genome diversity. We found that these 3 woodpecker species are genomically distinct. Although low levels of gene flow occur between D. nuttallii and D. scalaris across the contact zone, there was no evidence for widespread genomic introgression between these 2 species. Overall patterns of genomic diversity from the RAD-seq and whole-genome datasets appear to be related to distributional range size and, by extension, are likely related to effective population sizes for each species.	2019	10.1093/auk/ukz015		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE

Rubtsov, A. S.; Opaev, A. S.	Phylogeny reconstruction of the yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and pine bunting (Emberiza leucocephala) based on song and morphological characters	BIOLOGY BULLETIN	The yellowhammer and pine bunting represent a quite rare case of mass hybridization in a broad secondary contact zone. Previously, it was shown that the two forms did not differ by mitochondrial DNA (Irwin et al., 2009). This result allowed suggesting either a very close evolutionary relationship between these species or a consequence of borrowing the mitochondrial genome due to long-term hybridization. An attempt to reconstruct the phylogeny of these species was made on the basis of cluster analysis performed relative to the song characters and morphological features (male coloration and morphometric characters). The geographical variability of songs in yellowhammers and pine buntings was also investigated. The cladistic analysis included another 5 closely related bunting species: cirl (E. cirlus), chestnut-breasted (E. stewarti), ortolan (E. hortulana), grey-necked (E. buchanani), and Cretzschmar's bunting (E. caesia). Based on the results of our analysis, the yellowhammer and pine bunting show no sister relationship. They compose the smallest clusters: one with the cirl bunting and the other one with the chestnut-breasted bunting. Thus, in this paper we attempt to prove the hypothesis of a high divergence level between the species and mtDNA introgression from the pine bunting into the yellowhammer following long term hybridization. The analysis of song dialects agrees with the assumption that there existed an ancient hybrid zone between the yellowhammer and the pine bunting in Europe.	2012	10.1134/S1062359012090087		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE	
Smith, Steve; Fusani, Leonida; Boglarka, Balint; Sanchez-Donoso, Ines; Marasco, Valeria	Lack of introgression of Japanese quail in a captive population of common quail	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH	Farm-reared quails are released to the wild in Europe in vast numbers every year to increase hunting bag quotas. Experimental studies indicate that rather than the native common quail (Coturnix coturnix), the restocking is often done with domestic Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) or with hybrids of domestic Japanese quail and common quail. Such practices are thought to be a severe threat for the native species as it could lead to introgression of domestic Japanese quail alleles into the wild common quail genome and potentially alter the migratory and reproductive behaviour in wild populations. In this study, we assessed the genetic purity of a captive population of common quail that was established from wild-caught founders caught on the Southern Italian coast in Sicily (Italy). We evaluated the proportion of ancestry to common and Japanese quail in this captive population via genetic screening using nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA analyses. We showed that the captive farm quail in our study had no sign of admixture with domestic Japanese quail and had similar genotype frequencies relative to wild common quail, confirming the success of the breeding programme for the native species. We propose that raising common quails in captivity for restocking purposes rather than domestic Japanese quails or hybrids would be a feasible alternative that could minimise the risk of genetic pollution of wild common quail populations.	2018	10.1007/s10344-018-1209-7		Birds			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE

Bang, Sang Woo; Hatakeyama, Katsunori; Takahata, Yoshihito	The Use of Genome Information for Intergeneric Hybridization Breeding	RADISH GENOME	Radish is an important vegetable crop and has several agriculturally useful traits to improve the breeding of Brassica crops, which include cytoplasmic male sterility, resistance to pod shattering, tolerance to saline soils, and resistance to nematode and diseases. To transfer these traits into Brassica, a number of intergeneric hybridization have been performed using intergeneric cross and/or protoplast fusion, and it was shown that some of them were introduced successfully into and expressed in Brassica or hybrids with Brassica. The various kinds of hybrid progenies such as synthetic amphidiploid line, alloplasmic line, alien gene(s) introgression line, and monosomic alien chromosome addition line would be valuable genetic resources not only to breed more useful cultivars but also to analyze each chromosome and gene concerned. Recently, the development of numerous molecular markers for genetic study has been accelerated in radish, and a high-density linkage map has been constructed. These molecular tools have been used for the identification of QTLs associated with important agronomic traits of radish, genetic analysis of hybridization barrier between radish and Brassica crops, and comparative genomics of Brassicaceae. The further accumulation of genome information will facilitate the cloning of candidate genes in QTLs and the marker-assisted breeding in radish, in addition to the intergenomic transfer of useful radish genes into Brassica crops through intergeneric hybridization.	2017	10.1007/978-3-319-59253-4_14	10.1007/978-3-319-59253-4	Book			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE	
Rendon-Anaya, Martha; Herrera-Estrella, Alfredo	Requirement of Whole-Genome Sequencing	COMMON BEAN GENOME	Crop plants that sustain modern civilizations, including common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), were domesticated and improved by thousands of years of human selection, which transformed wild ancestors into high-yielding domesticated descendants. Understanding how the genome of crop species has been shaped through time, with and without human intervention, is a fascinating field of research. In addition, defining the loci and associated polymorphisms behind the emergence of domestication and improvement traits in P. vulgaris is of major importance. Uncovering intra- and inter-species introgression events that could indicate transferred genes, which together with domestication protein-coding and non-coding genes that have given rise to domestication and adaptive traits are required for future improvement strategies. Such strategies, in our view, will depend to a significant extent on crop re-wilding, given the local adaptations undergone by their wild relatives and climate change. Essential tools for reaching these goals have recently been developed, such as the complete genome sequences (similar to 600 Mb) of a Mesoamerican and an Andean accession, as well as a large gene expression atlas. Further, there are significant re-sequencing efforts for both wild and domesticated genotypes, which will play a major role in the future of this crop. Altogether, this information will allow the genetic dissection of the characters involved in the domestication and adaptation of the crop and their further implementation in breeding strategies faced with an ever-expanding human population and unpredictable environmental challenges.	2017	10.1007/978-3-319-63526-2_5	10.1007/978-3-319-63526-2	Book			TRUE	TRUE	methods book	FALSE			FALSE	
Barba-Gonzalez, R.; Lim, K. -B.; van Tuyl, J. M.	Molecular Cytogenetics in Lilium Breeding	III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE GENUS LILIUM	In horticulture, interspecific hybridization is one of the most important tools to achieve genetic variation; this is especially true when it comes to ornamental crops, where it is always necessary to introduce new traits, such as flower colour, petal shapes, stem size and strength, longevity, disease resistances and more. However, to maintain such traits in the progeny is necessary to introgress the genes of the alien species into the gene pool of the receptor species. To accomplish this, first sterility must be overcome, because, as a general rule, interspecific hybrids tend to be sterile. Mitotic polyploidization is a useful technique to come to such end, but the use of unreduced gametes is preferred because recombination occurs between the parental genomes and introgression might be achieved. Here it is described i) the production of interspecific, intersectional lily hybrids, obtained through the use special pollination techniques combined with ovary-and embryo-rescue techniques, in crosses of distantly related lily hybrids, cultivars and species from different taxonomical sections (L. longiflorum x Asiatic hybrids (LA), L. longiflorum x Oriental hybrids (LO), L. longiflorum x L. rubellum (LR), L. longiflorum x L. henryi (LH), L. henryi x L. candidum (HC), L. auratum x L. henryi (AuH), L. martagon x Asiatic hybrids (MA), Oriental hybrids x Asiatic hybrids (OA), Oriental hybrids x Trumpet hybrids (OT) and Oriental hybrids x L. pardalinum (OP)); ii) the use of molecular Genomic in situ Hybridization (GISH) to depict the mechanisms of 2n gamete formation and their use for the production of sexual polyploids; iii) the utilization of allotriploid BC1 progenies in introgression breeding and iv) the application of N2O to induce the formation of unreduced gametes in sterile lily hybrids.	2014			Conference abstract			TRUE	TRUE		FALSE			FALSE

Advances in genomics: applications to banana breeding	XXIX INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON HORTICULTURE: SUSTAINING LIVES, LIVELIHOODS AND LANDSCAPES (IHC2014): IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BANANA: ISHS-PROMUSA SYMPOSIUM ON UNRAVELLING THE BANANA'S GENOMIC POTENTIAL	Like many vegetatively propagated crops, most cultivated bananas are highly heterozygous polyploids of mono or interspecific constitution. During human selection for edibility over thousands of years, Musa cultivars developed a particularly high level of male and female gamete sterility associated with a low fertilizing potential making genetic recombination through meiosis and hybridization rare events during domestication. Recent evolutionary studies in Musa suggest that only a few hybridization events occurred from the wild seedy primitive ancestors to the most evolved present day cultivars. Unlike other crops, in such a context where the species complex is nearly fixed, banana breeding relies on strategies where an extremely limited number of crosses are possible. Several genomic tools are now being used to decipher the complexity of the Musa genepool. Molecular markers can distinguish between genotypes and have provided a clear understanding of banana domestication suggesting only a few hybridization events from the wild seedy primitive to the present day cultivars. This allows us to build breeding schemes mimicking the sequence of crossings and selections that occurred over several millennia. The Musa genome can now be explored for desirable genes and subsequent marker-assisted selection. For banana improvement, this approach is particularly important in a biological context of gamete sterility (and difficulties to get large quantities of seeds) for which recombination and implementation of introgression strategies remain the greatest challenge.	2016			Conference Abstract?

Zhu, Y. J.; Jia, R.	Papaya genome analysis for disease resistance genes and molecular markers in Carica papaya and wild relative: Vasconcellea goudotiana	XXIX INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON HORTICULTURE: SUSTAINING LIVES, LIVELIHOODS AND LANDSCAPES (IHC2014): IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PAPAYA, VIII INTERNATIONAL PINEAPPLE SYMPOSIUM, AND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MANGO	Carica papaya is challenged by a wide range of pests and pathogens that diminish fruit yield and marketability. Today, heterologous transformation and interspecific and intergeneric hybridization are used to improve disease resistance. Transgenes and the introgression of resistance from papaya cultivars and its wild relatives have been used to control several strains of Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) as well as other pathogens, such as Phytophtora palmivora. Expansions of these sources of resistance are needed to ensure that modern cultivars evolve with microbial populations. The papaya genome sequence is available and can be used to provide markers to identify and isolate R-genes from C. papaya and related species. The emergence of new diseases and movement of pathogens suggests that extending resistance durability will require a comprehensive strategy of integrating genetic resistance, cultural practices, and factors including innate protection provided by beneficial plant-microbe interactions. In this paper, the current status of papaya genome analysis for disease resistance genes and molecular markers from C. papaya and wild relative, Vasconcellea goudotiana are presented. Strategies of developing and coordinating the use papaya's disease resistance resources are discussed to ensure that this species continues to provide a valuable source of nutrition for the world's tropical and subtropical regions.	2016	10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1111.1		Conference Abstract?

Kur, Pavel; Kosnar, Jiri; Koutecky, Petr; Tremetsberger, Karin; Stech, Milan	Origin of Spergularia xkurkae, a hybrid between the rare endemic S. echinosperma and its widespread congener S. rubra	PRESLIA	The origin of Spergularia xkurkae, a presumed tetraploid hybrid between the diploid central European endemic S. echinosperma and its widespread tetraploid congener S. rubra, was investigated by sequencing the nrDNA ITS region and cpDNA rpoC1 intron. Spergularia echinosperma and S. rubra differed markedly in their ITS sequences. The presence of both sequences within the genome of S. xkurkae confirmed its hybrid origin and parentage; cpDNA sequences identified S. echinosperma as the sole maternal parent. Because both parental ITS homeologs were clearly visible in the sequences of almost all of the S. xkurkae individuals, we conclude that this taxon is of a relatively young age. We hypothesize that S. xkurkae might have evolved as a result of human-mediated introduction of S. rubra into fishponds. Cross-amplification of species-specific ITS primers revealed high levels of intra-individual ITS polymorphisms in S. echinosperma and S. rubra. Our results suggest ongoing gene flow from S. xkurkae to S. rubra. In contrast, no evidence of gene flow from S. xkurkae or S. rubra to S. echinosperma was found, providing, despite concerns, no support for the threat of the genetic assimilation of S. echinosperma. Our current data also support the view of S. kurkae as a stabilized, separate allopolyploid species.	2016			Conference or dissertation abstract?			TRUE	TRUE		FALSE			FALSE

Uthicke, S; Purcell, S; Blockmans, B	Natural hybridization does not dissolve species boundaries in commercially important sea cucumbers	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	The study of species boundaries in areas of sympatry provides important insight into speciation processes. We investigated whether (i) two sympatric holothurians, Holothuria scabra and H. s. var. versicolor constituted species, and (ii) specimens of intermediate phenotype hybrids. Results from allozyme and 16S mtDNA sequence analyses indicated these two sea cucumbers to be distinct but young biological and phylogenetic species. Several private allozyme alleles existed and a Bayesian analysis grouped varieties into separate clusters. MtDNA sequences hardly varied within each taxon, and nine single bp changes were diagnostic between these two taxa. Allozyme allele frequencies in individuals of intermediate phenotype were intermediate to those of H. scabra and H. s. var. versicolor, most private alleles were present and heterozygote frequencies were higher than in either species. Ancestry coefficients modelled for these individuals were close to 0.5, indicating that the two taxa contributed equally to their genome. MtDNA sequences were identical to those of either species. We conclude that individuals of intermediate phenotype represent F1 hybrids. The presence of hybrids demonstrates that the opportunity for introgression exists, but is not realized, as backcrossing and introgression were not supported by the data. Thus, the genetic integrity of either holothurian species remains intact through an unknown postzygotic mechanism, possibly hybrid sterility.

Understanding the genetic effects of hybridization and introgression requires a large set of high-throughput, diagnostic genetic markers to inform conservation and management. Recently, we identified several thousand candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on RAD sequencing of 11 westslope cutthroat trout and 13 rainbow trout individuals. Here, we used flanking sequence for 56 of these candidate SNP markers to design high-throughput genotyping assays. We validated the assays on a total of 92 individuals from 22 populations and seven hatchery strains. Forty-six assays (82%) amplified consistently and allowed easy identification of westslope cutthroat and rainbow trout alleles as well as heterozygote controls. The 46 SNPs will provide high power for early detection of population admixture and improved identification of hybrid and nonhybridized individuals. This technique shows promise as a very low-cost, reliable and relatively rapid method for developing and testing SNP markers for nonmodel organisms with limited genomic resources.	2012	10.1111/j.1755-0998.2012.03157.x		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	RAD to detect hybrids	FALSE			FALSE	
Beres, Beatrix; Sipos, Dora Kanaine; Mueller, Tamas; Staszny, Adam; Farkas, Milan; Bakos, Katalin; Orban, Laszlo; Urbanyi, Bela; Kovacs, Balazs	Species-specific markers provide molecular genetic evidence for natural introgression of bullhead catfishes in Hungary	PEERJ	Since three bullhead catfish species were introduced to Europe in the late 19th century, they have spread to most European countries. In Hungary, the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) was more widespread in the 1970s-1980s, but the black bullhead (Ameiurus melas) has gradually supplanted since their second introduction in 1980. The introgressive hybridization of the two species has been presumed based on morphological examinations, but it has not previously been supported by genetic evidence. In this study, 11 different Hungarian habitats were screened with a new species -specific nuclear genetic, duplex PCR based, marker system to distinguish the introduced catfish species, Ameiurus nebulosus, Ameiurus melas, and Ameiurus natal is, as well as the hybrids of the first two. More than 460 specimens were analyzed using the above markers and additional mitochondrial sequence analyses were also conducted on >25% of the individuals from each habitat s sampled. anThe results showed that only 7.9% of the specimens from two habitats belonged to Ameiurus nebulosus, and 92.1% were classified as Ameiurus melas of all habitats, whereas the presence of Ameiurus natalis was not detected. Two specimens (>0.4%) showed the presence of both nuclear genomes and they were identified as hybrids of Ameiurus melas and Ameiurus nebulosus. An additional two individuals showed contradicting results from the nuclear and mitochondrial assays as a sign of a possible footprint of introgressive hybridization that might have happened two or more generations before. Surprisingly,' the level of hybridization was much smaller than expected based on the analyses of the North American continent's indigenous stock from the hybrid zones. This phenomenon has been observed in several invasive fish species and it is regarded as an added level of complexity in the management of their rapid adaptation.	2017	10.7717/peerj.2804		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid detection using markers	FALSE			FALSE

Epistatic regulation of growth in Atlantic salmon revealed: a QTL study performed on the domesticated-wild interface	BMC GENETICS	Background Quantitative traits are typically considered to be under additive genetic control. Although there are indications that non-additive factors have the potential to contribute to trait variation, experimental demonstration remains scarce. Here, we investigated the genetic basis of growth in Atlantic salmon by exploiting the high level of genetic diversity and trait expression among domesticated, hybrid and wild populations. Results After rearing fish in common-garden experiments under aquaculture conditions, we performed a variance component analysis in four mapping populations totaling similar to 7000 individuals from six wild, two domesticated and three F1 wild/domesticated hybrid strains. Across the four independent datasets, genome-wide significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with weight and length were detected on a total of 18 chromosomes, reflecting the polygenic nature of growth. Significant QTLs correlated with both length and weight were detected on chromosomes 2, 6 and 9 in multiple datasets. Significantly, epistatic QTLs were detected in all datasets. Discussion The observed interactions demonstrated that the phenotypic effect of inheriting an allele deviated between half-sib families. Gene-by-gene interactions were also suggested, where the combined effect of two loci resulted in a genetic effect upon phenotypic variance, while no genetic effect was detected when the two loci were considered separately. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of epistasis in a quantitative trait in Atlantic salmon. These novel results are of relevance for breeding programs, and for predicting the evolutionary consequences of domestication-introgression in wild populations.	2020	10.1186/s12863-020-0816-y		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	QTL	FALSE			FALSE	
Bicskei, Beatrix; Taggart, John B.; Glover, Kevin A.; Bron, James E.	Comparing the transcriptomes of embryos from domesticated and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) stocks and examining factors that influence heritability of gene expression	GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION	Background: Due to selective breeding, domesticated and wild Atlantic salmon are genetically diverged, which raises concerns about farmed escapees having the potential to alter the genetic composition of wild populations and thereby disrupting local adaptation. Documenting transcriptional differences between wild and domesticated stocks under controlled conditions is one way to explore the consequences of domestication and selection. We compared the transcriptomes of wild and domesticated Atlantic salmon embryos, by using a custom 44k oligonucleotide microarray to identify perturbed gene pathways between the two stocks, and to document the inheritance patterns of differentially-expressed genes by examining gene expression in their reciprocal hybrids. Results: Data from 24 array interrogations were analysed: four reciprocal cross types (W female x W male, D female x W male; W female x D male, D female x D male) x six biological replicates. A common set of 31,491 features on the microarrays passed quality control, of which about 62 % were assigned a KEGG Orthology number. A total of 6037 distinct genes were identified for gene-set enrichment/pathway analysis. The most highly enriched functional groups that were perturbed between the two stocks were cellular signalling and immune system, ribosome and RNA transport, and focal adhesion and gap junction pathways, relating to cell communication and cell adhesion molecules. Most transcripts that were differentially expressed between the stocks were governed by additive gene interaction (33 to 42 %). Maternal dominance and over-dominance were also prevalent modes of inheritance, with no convincing evidence for a stock effect. Conclusions: Our data indicate that even at this relatively early developmental stage, transcriptional differences exist between the two stocks and affect pathways that are relevant to wild versus domesticated environments. Many of the identified differentially perturbed pathways are involved in organogenesis, which is expected to be an active process at the eyed egg stage. The dominant effects are more largely due to the maternal line than to the origin of the stock. This finding is particularly relevant in the context of potential introgression between farmed and wild fish, since female escapees tend to have a higher spawning success rate compared to males.	2016	10.1186/s12711-016-0200-6		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Bolnick, Daniel I.; Turelli, Michael; Lopez-Fernandez, Hernin; Wainwright, Peter C.; Near, Thomas J.	Accelerated mitochondrial evolution and "Darwin's corollary": Asymmetric viability of reciprocal F-1 hybrids in centrarchid fishes	GENETICS	Reciprocal crosses between species can yield hybrids with different viabilities. The high frequency of this asymmetric hybrid viability ("Darwin's corollary") places it alongside Haldane's rule and the "large-X effect" as a general feature of postmating reproductive isolation. Recent theory suggests that reciprocal cross asymmetries can arise from stochastic substitutions in uniparentally inherited loci such as mitochondrial genomes, although large systematic differences in mitochondrial substitution rates can also contribute to asymmetries. Although the magnitude of asymmetry will be relatively insensitive to unequal rates of mitochondrial evolution in diverging species, we show here that rate asymmetries can have a large effect on the direction of viability asymmetries. In reciprocal crosses between species, the maternal parent with faster mitochondrial evolution will tend to produce less viable F, hybrids owing to an increased probability of mito-nuclear incompatibilities. We test this prediction using data on reciprocal hybrid viability and molecular evolution rates from a clade of freshwater fishes, Centrarchidae. As predicted, species with accelerated mitochondrial evolution tend to be the worse maternal parent for F, hybrids, providing the first comparative evidence for a systematic basis to Darwin's corollary. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that mito-nuclear incompatibilities can play an important role in reproductive isolation. Such asymmetrical reproductive isolation may help explain the asymmetrical mitochondrial introgression observed between many hybridizing species. However, as with any comparative study, we cannot rule out the possibility that our results arise from a mutual correlation with a third variable such as body size.	2008	10.1534/genetics.107.081364		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	not about introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Castillo, Ana G. F.; Moran, Paloma; Hurtado, Ninoska.; Vega, Jose A.; Perez, Juliana.; Martinez, Jose L.; Garcia-Vazquez, Eva	Mechanisms for introgression in allotriploid fish	AQUACULTURE	Allotriploids (bearing two chromosome sets from one species+one chromosome set from another species) can be obtained from backcrosses between interspecific hybrids that produce unreduced gametes and one of the parental species. Sexual reproduction of allotriploids producing recombinant offspring has been recently described in the genus Salmo (Atlantic salmon, Salmo solar, and brown trout, Solmo trutta). Although they produce a high rate of abnormal spermatozoids, allotriploid male hybrids of Atlantic salmon (2n = 58) and brown trout (2n = 80) produce some functional reduced gametes that can fertilize salmon ova, generating salmon-like offspring. These F-2 Offspring bear some brown trout genes. When a telomeric probe was hybridized on synaptonemal complexes of allotriploid males only double or single signals were obtained, demonstrating that chromosome pairing in bivalents or univalents occurred in meiosis prophase 1. This is parallel to homologous pairing described in plant allotriploid meiosis. Recombinant genotypes in offspring of allotriploid salmonids can be explained by monosomic inheritance of some trout chromosomes, not by heterologous pairing and recombination. The use of introgressive hybridization for transferring desired genes (or linkage groups) into cultivated species could be considered a subject of further exploration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Such study is especially challenging in hybrid systems, where usual vectors mediating interspecific gene transfers hybrids with Mendelian heredity - are absent or unknown. Here we study a complex of hybridizing species, which are known to produce clonal hybrids, to discover how one of the species, Cobitis tanaitica, has achieved a pattern of mito-nuclear mosaic genome over the whole geographic range. We appplied three distinct methods, including the method using solely the information on gene tree topologies, and found that the contrasting mito-nuclear signal might not have resulted from the retention of ancestral polymorphism. Instead, we found two signs of hybridization events related to C. tanaitica; one concerning nuclear gene flow and the other suggested mitochondrial capture. Interestingly, clonal inheritance ( gynogenesis) of contemporary hybrids prevents genomic introgressions and non-clonal hybrids are either absent or too rare to be detected among European Cobitis. Our analyses therefore suggest that introgressive hybridizations are rather old episodes, mediated by previously existing hybrids whose inheritance was not entirely clonal. Cobitis complex thus supports the view that the type of resulting hybrids depends on a level of genomic divergence between sexual species.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0080641		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	No ongoing introgression, tree based methods	FALSE			FALSE

Copy number increases of transposable elements and protein-coding genes in an invasive fish of hybrid origin	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Evolutionary dynamics of structural genetic variation in lineages of hybrid origin is not well explored, although structural mutations may increase in controlled hybrid crosses. We therefore tested whether structural variants accumulate in a fish of recent hybrid origin, invasive Cottus, relative to both parental species Cottus rhenanus and Cottus perifretum. Copy-number variation in exons of 10,979 genes was assessed using comparative genome hybridization arrays. Twelve genes showed significantly higher copy numbers in invasive Cottus compared to both parents. This coincided with increased expression for three genes related to vision, detoxification and muscle development, suggesting possible gene dosage effects. Copy number increases of putative transposons were assessed by comparative mapping of genomic DNA reads against a de novo assembly of 1,005 repetitive elements. In contrast to exons, copy number increases of repetitive elements were common (20.7%) in invasive Cottus, whereas decrease was very rare (0.01%). Among the increased repetitive elements, 53.8% occurred at higher numbers in C. perifretum compared to C. rhenanus, while only 1.4% were more abundant in C. rhenanus. This implies a biased mutational process that amplifies genetic material from one ancestor. To assess the frequency of de novo mutations through hybridization, we screened 64 laboratory-bred F-2 offspring between the parental species for copy-number changes at five candidate loci. We found no evidence for new structural variants, indicating that they are too rare to be detected given our sampling scheme. Instead, they must have accumulated over more generations than we observed in a controlled cross.	2017	10.1111/mec.14134		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	CNV analysis in hybrids	FALSE			FALSE	
Duvernell, David D.; Meier, Stephanie L.; Schaefer, Jacob F.; Kreiser, Brian R.	Contrasting phylogeographic histories between broadly sympatric topminnows in the Fundulus notatus species complex	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Sympatrically distributed closely related species provide opportunities for studying evolutionary patterns of diversification. Such studies must account for historical contingencies in interpreting contemporary patterns of variation. Topminnows in the Fundulus notatus species complex are distributed sympatrically across much of the southern and Midwestern United States. Throughout most of their ranges F. olivaceus is often found in headwater stream habitats, and F. notatus is more typically distributed along the margins of larger river habitats. However, in some drainages, ecological associations of the respective species are reversed, with F. notatus populations isolated in headwater streams and F. olivaceus in downstream river habitats. Phylogeographic analyses of AFLP marker and multi-locus sequence data detected historical isolation in F. notatus consistent with pre-Pleistocene drainage patterns. Four F. notatus clades corresponded to (i) the Western Gulf Slope, (ii) the southwestern Ouachita Highlands, (iii) the Mobile Basin, and (iv) central Coastal Plain and Mississippi River Basin. In contrast, a relative lack of range-wide geographic structure in F. olivaceus is consistent with recent range expansion over much of the same geographic area. The southwestern Ouachita Highlands and Mobile Basin F. notatus clades corresponded to regions where ecological associations between the two species are reversed, providing evidence of the independent evolution of variation in contemporary habitat associations. Fundulus olivaceus from several drainages demonstrated introgression of mitochondrial DNA from F. notatus, but none of the sites in this study included individuals with hybrid ancestry in their nuclear genome. Phylogenetic analyses that included only nuclear loci supported the reciprocal monophyly of F. notatus, F. olivaceus and a third narrowly endemic species, Fundulus euryzonus, and supported a sister relationship between F. olivaceus and F. euryzonus.

Elliott, Lucas; Russello, Michael A.	SNP panels for differentiating advanced-generation hybrid classes in recently diverged stocks: A sensitivity analysis to inform monitoring of sockeye salmon re-stocking programs	FISHERIES RESEARCH	Molecular markers have been employed for monitoring fisheries re-stocking initiatives for decades, however, as such programs mature, traditional genetic markers may be ineffective at distinguishing more advanced introgression classes (e.g. backcrosses and F-2 hybrids). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can enable more accurate and cost-effective monitoring, but there is a need to evaluate the number of markers relative to their information content, especially in cases where native and re-introduced stocks have only recently diverged. This is the case with the anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocking program in Skaha Lake that has seen successful stock establishment since commencement in 2004, but also hybridization with resident kokanee. Genetic monitoring to date has been unable to accurately assign hybrids beyond F-1, which is a management need moving forward. Here, we conducted a simulation-based study to evaluate the accuracy and power of varying subsets of the data to assign individuals to advanced-generation hybrid classes. Using empirical data at 6339 variable SNPs previously collected from the reference populations, we simulated six introgression classes ranging from F-1 to B-3-backcrosses, using eight different datasets [100 random, 100 highest F-st, 300 random, 300 highest F-st, 1000 random, 1000 highest F-st, 23 outliers, 6326 non-outliers] and evaluated their performance using two different assignment algorithms (LEA and NEWHYBRIDS). As expected, greater number and divergence (high F-st) of markers yielded greater assignment accuracy. NEWHYBRIDS outperformed LEA in all comparisons except for the 6326 SNP panel. Overall, the 300 highest F-st SNP panel should provide the optimal balance of resolution and cost-effectiveness for monitoring introgression trends in Skaha Lake over the coming decade. Given the need for system-specific assessment of introgressive hybridization, we recommend similar simulation-based analyses for optimizing SNP panels for a given system and management question prior to commencing genetic monitoring.	2018	10.1016/j.fishres.2018.09.001		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Analysis of hybrid detection methods 	FALSE			FALSE

Reducing Hybridization and Introgression in Wild Populations of Guadalupe Bass through Supplemental Stocking	BLACK BASS DIVERSITY: MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE FOR CONSERVATION	Interspecific hybridization among micropterids was once thought to be rare but has been documented in several cases of North American endemics. Introduction of the nonnative Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu across Texas has threatened to eliminate the Guadalupe Bass M. treculii genome throughout its native range via introgression between the species. In 1992, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department began a stocking program in the Guadalupe River watershed to restore the genetic integrity of the local population. More than 600,000 hatchery-reared Guadalupe Bass fingerlings (similar to 30 mm total length) were stocked in Johnson Creek over a 19-year period, and 360,000 fish were released in the North Fork, South Fork, and main-stem Guadalupe River over a 5-year period. Annual genetic monitoring indicated that hybridization significantly declined in all stream segments (P < 0.001) during the period of time when stocking occurred. Initially high hybridization rates (range, 20-100%; mean = 43.4%) were reduced to 0-24.2% (mean = 11.4%) at the termination of stocking. Linear regression indicated that hybridization in the North Fork and main-stem stream segments declined faster (9.0% per year) than all other test stream segments, whereas the South Fork Guadalupe River and upper Johnson Creek declined at 0.9% per year and lower Johnson Creek declined at 1.9% per year. Our data show that supplemental stocking is an effective approach to genetic restoration of compromised populations and should be considered as a viable management and conservation tool.	2015			Fish			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE

However, the evolutionary causes and genomic mechanisms underlying this variation and instability are yet to be understood. Here we report on an over 30-year evolutionary experiment in which we tested the genomic consequences of hybridisation and selection between two Xiphophorus fish species with different sex chromosome systems. We find that introgression and imposing selection for pigmentation phenotypes results in the retention of an unexpectedly large maternally derived genomic region. During the hybridisation process, the sex-determining region of the X chromosome from one parental species was translocated to an autosome in the hybrids leading to the evolution of a new sex chromosome. Our results highlight the complexity of factors contributing to patterns observed in hybrid genomes, and we experimentally demonstrate that hybridisation can catalyze rapid evolution of a new sex chromosome.	2018	10.1038/s41467-018-07648-2		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Experimental hybridization	FALSE			FALSE	
Hashimoto, Diogo Teruo; Senhorini, Jose Augusto; Foresti, Fausto; Martinez, Paulino; Porto-Foresti, Fabio	Genetic Identification of F1 and Post-F1 Serrasalmid Juvenile Hybrids in Brazilian Aquaculture	PLOS ONE	Juvenile fish trade monitoring is an important task on Brazilian fish farms. However, the identification of juvenile fish through morphological analysis is not feasible, particularly between interspecific hybrids and pure species individuals, making the monitoring of these individuals difficult. Hybrids can be erroneously identified as pure species in breeding facilities, which might reduce production on farms and negatively affect native populations due to escapes or stocking practices. In the present study, we used a multi-approach analysis (molecular and cytogenetic markers) to identify juveniles of three serrasalmid species (Colossoma macropomum, Piaractus mesopotamicus and Piaractus brachypomus) and their hybrids in different stocks purchased from three seed producers in Brazil. The main findings of this study were the detection of intergenus backcrossing between the hybrid female patinga (P. mesopotamicus x P. brachypomus) x C. macropomum and the occurrence of one hybrid triploid individual. This atypical specimen might result from automixis, a mechanism that produces unreduced gametes in some organisms. Moreover, molecular identification indicated that hybrid individuals are traded as pure species or other types of interspecific hybrids, particularly post-F1 individuals. These results show that serrasalmid fish genomes exhibit high genetic heterogeneity, and multi-approach methods and regulators could improve the surveillance of the production and trade of fish species and their hybrids, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of fish farming.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0089902		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid detection 	FALSE			FALSE	
Kimura-Kawaguchi, M. R.; Horita, M.; Abe, S.; Arai, K.; Kawata, M.; Munehara, H.	Identification of hemiclonal reproduction in three species of Hexagrammos marine reef fishes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY	a Natural hybrids between the boreal species Hexagrammos octogrammus and two temperate species Hexagrammos agrammus and Hexagrammos otakii were observed frequently in southern Hokkaido, Japan. Previous studies revealed that H. octogrammus is a maternal ancestor of both hybrids; the hybrids are all fertile females and they frequently breed with paternal species. Although such rampant hybridization occurs, species boundaries have been maintained in the hybrid zone. Possible explanations for the absence of introgressions, despite the frequent backcrossing, might include clonal reproduction: parthenogenesis, gynogenesis and hybridogenesis. The natural hybrids produced haploid eggs that contained only the H. octogrammus genome (maternal ancestor) with discarded paternal genome and generated F-1-hybrid type offspring by fertilization with the haploid sperm of H. agrammus or H. otakii (paternal ancestor). This reproductive mode was found in an artificial backcross hybrid between the natural hybrid and a male of the paternal ancestor. These findings indicate that the natural hybrids adopt hybridogenesis with high possibility and produce successive generations through hybridogenesis by backcrossing with the paternal ancestor. These hybrids of Hexagrammos represent the first hybridogenetic system found from marine fishes that widely inhabit the North Pacific Ocean. In contrast with other hybridogenetic systems, these Hexagrammos hybrids coexist with all three ancestral species in the hybrid zone. The coexistence mechanism is also discussed.

Krueck, Nils C.; Tibbetts, Ian R.; Ward, Robert D.; Johnson, Jeffrey W.; Loh, William K. W.; Ovenden, Jennifer R.	Multi-gene barcoding to discriminate sibling species within a morphologically difficult fish genus (Sillago)	FISHERIES RESEARCH	Fisheries species that cannot be reliably identified based on unique morphological features pose a challenge for research, monitoring and management. DNA barcoding, which refers to a standardized procedure for genetic species identification based on the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) gene, is an important tool to confront this problem. Here, we present a multi-gene barcoding approach to discriminate two fisheries species flagged as sibling species within the morphologically difficult fish genus Sillago: S analis and S. ciliata. CO1 revealed low interspecific variation that was insufficient for genetic distance-based species identification. Despite this, one diagnostic site did permit genetic character-based identification. However, four cases of mismatch among morphological identifications (mIDs) and CO1 barcodes required analysing additional genes and loci. A spot test approach was used to screen five other genes in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and four genes in the nuclear genome (nuDNA). The nuDNA recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2) revealed most diagnostic sites, correctly clustering mIDs of all individuals using both genetic distance- and character-based analysis. Three of four cases of mID/CO1 mismatches were found to be simultaneous CO1/RAG2 (mtDNA/nuDNA) mismatches indicative of past hybridization. The fourth mID/CO1 mismatch was found to represent an initial morphological misidentification. Five spot-tested genes, containing either fully or partially diagnostic sites (mtDNA: NADH dehydrogenase 2 [ND2], ATP synthase [ATPase] and cytochrome b; nuDNA: histone protein 3a and ring finger protein 213), confirmed these findings. Based on our preliminary data, we recommend (I) that S. analis and S. ciliata retain their taxonomic status as sibling species with full corresponding recognition as separate management and conservation units, and (2) precautionary management of S. ciliata fisheries until further research into hybridization is carried out. The multi-gene spot test approach and efficient markers (RAG2 in combination with ND2, ATPase or CO1) may help identifying other problematic fish species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Lampert, K. P.; Schartl, M.	The origin and evolution of a unisexual hybrid: Poecilia formosa	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Clonal reproduction in vertebrates can always be traced back to hybridization events as all known unisexual vertebrates are hybrids between recognized species or genetically defined races. Interestingly, clonal vertebrates often also rely on interspecific matings for their reproduction because gynogenesis ( sperm- dependent parthenogenesis) and hybridogenesis are common modes of propagation. While in most cases these hybridization events leave no hereditary traces in the offspring, occasionally the genome exclusion mechanism fails and either small parts of male genetic material remain inside the oocyte in the form of microchromosomes, or fusion of the sperm nucleus with the oocyte nucleus leads to polyploid individuals. In this review, we highlight the important role of hybridization for the origin and evolution of a unisexual hybrid: the Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa.	2008	10.1098/rstb.2008.0040		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	no introgression	FALSE			FALSE

High-density interspecific genetic linkage mapping provides insights into genomic incompatibility between channel catfish and blue catfish	ANIMAL GENETICS	Catfish is the leading aquaculture species in the United States. The interspecific hybrid catfish produced by mating female channel catfish with male blue catfish outperform both of their parent species in a number of traits. However, mass production of the hybrids has been difficult because of reproductive isolation. Investigations of genome structure and organization of the hybrids provide insights into the genetic basis for maintenance of species divergence in the face of gene flow, thereby helping develop strategies for introgression and efficient production of the hybrids for aquaculture. In this study, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using the hybrid catfish system with the catfish 250K SNP array. A total of 26238 SNPs were mapped to 29 linkage groups, with 12776 unique marker positions. The linkage map spans approximately 3240cM with an average intermarker distance of 0.25cM. A fraction of markers (986 of 12776) exhibited significant deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio of segregation, and they were clustered in major genomic blocks across 15 LGs, most notably LG9 and LG15. The distorted markers exhibited significant bias for maternal alleles among the backcross progenies, suggesting strong selection against the blue catfish alleles. The clustering of distorted markers within genomic blocks should lend insights into speciation as marked by incompatibilities between the two species. Such findings should also have profound implications for understanding the genomic evolution of closely related species as well as the introgression of hybrid production programs in aquaculture.	2016	10.1111/age.12372		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Linkage mapping of hybrids	FALSE			FALSE

Synaptonemal Complexes in the Hybridogenetic Squalius alburnoides Fish Complex: New Insights on the Gametogenesis of Allopolyploids	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	In the Squalius alburnoides fish complex, allotriploid females (3n = 75) reproduce mostly by meiotic hybridogenesis, producing haploid gametes by means of the elimination of the heterospecific chromosome set and recombination between the 2 homospecific genomes. A synaptonemal complexes (SCs) analysis was performed in specimens from a confined southern population (Quarteira, Portugal) to understand chromosome dynamics during gametogenesis. The comparative study between hybrid females with QAA genome composition and the parental bisexual species Squalius aradensis (2n = 50, QQ genome) evidenced: (i) that allotriploid meiocytes comprise the complete chromosome set (75 chromosomes) in prophase I, proving the heterospecific genome (Q) is only excluded after pachytene stage, and (ii) a 2-phase synaptic process where initially, exclusively homologous SCs form and the unmatched univalents remain in a bouquet conformation, followed by the establishment of extensive non-homologous SCs with multivalent associations among the later. These findings disagree with most literature concerning the meiotic process in allotriploid vertebrates, since the most accountable mechanisms (premeiotic exclusion of the unmatched chromosome set and whole genome endoduplication) were not observed.

Oke, Krista B.; Westley, Peter A. H.; Moreau, Darek T. R.; Fleming, Ian A.	Hybridization between genetically modified Atlantic salmon and wild brown trout reveals novel ecological interactions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Interspecific hybridization is a route for transgenes from genetically modified (GM) animals to invade wild populations, yet the ecological effects and potential risks that may emerge from such hybridization are unknown. Through experimental crosses, we demonstrate transmission of a growth hormone transgene via hybridization between a candidate for commercial aquaculture production, GM Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and closely related wild brown trout (Salmo trutta). Transgenic hybrids were viable and grew more rapidly than transgenic salmon and other non-transgenic crosses in hatchery-like conditions. In stream mesocosms designed to more closely emulate natural conditions, transgenic hybrids appeared to express competitive dominance and suppressed the growth of transgenic and non-transgenic (wildtype) salmon by 82 and 54 percent, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of environmental impacts of hybridization between a GM animal and a closely related species. These results provide empirical evidence of the first steps towards introgression of foreign transgenes into the genomes of new species and contribute to the growing evidence that transgenic animals have complex and context-specific interactions with wild populations. We suggest that interspecific hybridization be explicitly considered when assessing the environmental consequences should transgenic animals escape to nature.	2013	10.1098/rspb.2013.1047		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	HIL	FALSE			FALSE

Growth, Morphology, and Developmental Instability of Rainbow Trout, Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout, and Four Hybrid Generations	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY	Hybridization of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii with nonindigenous rainbow trout O. mykiss contributes to the decline of cutthroat trout subspecies throughout their native range. Introgression by rainbow trout can swamp the gene pools of cutthroat trout populations, especially if there is little selection against hybrids. We used rainbow trout, Yellowstone cutthroat trout O. clarkii bouvieri, and rainbow trout x Yellowstone cutthroat trout F-1 hybrids as parents to construct seven different line crosses: F-1 hybrids (both reciprocal crosses), F-2 hybrids, first-generation backcrosses (both rainbow trout and Yellowstone cutthroat trout), and both parental taxa. We compared growth, morphology, and developmental instability among these seven crosses reared at two different temperatures. Growth was related to the proportion of rainbow trout genome present within the crosses. Meristic traits were influenced by maternal, additive, dominant, overdominant, and (probably) epistatic genetic effects. Developmental stability, however, was not disturbed in F-1 hybrids, F-2 hybrids, or backcrosses. Backcrosses were morphologically similar to their recurrent parent. The lack of developmental instability in hybrids suggests that there are few genetic incompatibilities preventing introgression. Our findings suggest that hybrids are not equal: that is, growth, development, character traits, and morphology differ depending on the genomic contribution from each parental species as well as the hybrid generation.	2011	10.1080/00028487.2011.567866		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	No stats	FALSE			FALSE	
Ostberg, Carl O.; Hauser, Lorenz; Pritchard, Victoria L.; Garza, John C.; Naish, Kerry A.	Chromosome rearrangements, recombination suppression, and limited segregation distortion in hybrids between Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss)	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Introgressive hybridization is an important evolutionary process that can lead to the creation of novel genome structures and thus potentially new genetic variation for selection to act upon. On the other hand, hybridization with introduced species can threaten native species, such as cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) following the introduction of rainbow trout (O. mykiss). Neither the evolutionary consequences nor conservation implications of rainbow trout introgression in cutthroat trout is well understood. Therefore, we generated a genetic linkage map for rainbow-Yellowstone cutthroat trout (O. clarkii bouvieri) hybrids to evaluate genome processes that may help explain how introgression affects hybrid genome evolution. Results: The hybrid map closely aligned with the rainbow trout map (a cutthroat trout map does not exist), sharing all but one linkage group. This linkage group (RYHyb20) represented a fusion between an acrocentric (Omy28) and a metacentric chromosome (Omy20) in rainbow trout. Additional mapping in Yellowstone cutthroat trout indicated the two rainbow trout homologues were fused in the Yellowstone genome. Variation in the number of hybrid linkage groups (28 or 29) likely depended on a Robertsonian rearrangement polymorphism within the rainbow trout stock. Comparison between the female-merged F-1 map and a female consensus rainbow trout map revealed that introgression suppressed recombination across large genomic regions in 5 hybrid linkage groups. Two of these linkage groups (RYHyb20 and RYHyb25_29) contained confirmed chromosome rearrangements between rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout indicating that rearrangements may suppress recombination. The frequency of allelic and genotypic segregation distortion varied among parents and families, suggesting few incompatibilities exist between rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout genomes. Conclusions: Chromosome rearrangements suppressed recombination in the hybrids. This result supports several previous findings demonstrating that recombination suppression restricts gene flow between chromosomes that differ by arrangement. Conservation of synteny and map order between the hybrid and rainbow trout maps and minimal segregation distortion in the hybrids suggest rainbow and Yellowstone cutthroat trout genomes freely introgress across chromosomes with similar arrangement. Taken together, these results suggest that rearrangements impede introgression. Recombination suppression across rearrangements could enable large portions of non-recombined chromosomes to persist within admixed populations.	2013	10.1186/1471-2164-14-570		Fish			TRUE	TRUE		FALSE			FALSE	
Pritchard, Victoria L.; Erkinaro, Jaakko; Kent, Matthew P.; Niemela, Eero; Orell, Panu; Lien, Sigbjorn; Primmer, Craig R.	Single nucleotide polymorphisms to discriminate different classes of hybrid between wild Atlantic salmon and aquaculture escapees	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Many wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations are threatened by introgressive hybridization from domesticated fish that have escaped from aquaculture facilities. A detailed understanding of the hybridization dynamics between wild salmon and aquaculture escapees requires discrimination of different hybrid classes; however, markers currently available to discriminate the two types of parental genome have limited power to do this. Using a high-density Atlantic salmon single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, in combination with pooled-sample allelotyping and an F-st outlier approach, we identified 200 SNPs that differentiated an important Atlantic salmon stock from the escapees potentially hybridizing with it. By simulating multiple generations of wild-escapee hybridization, involving wild populations in two major phylogeographic lineages and a genetically diverse set of escapees, we showed that both the complete set of SNPs and smaller subsets could reliably assign individuals to different hybrid classes up to the third hybrid (F3) generation. This set of markers will be a useful tool for investigating the genetic interactions between native wild fish and aquaculture escapees in many Atlantic salmon populations.	2016	10.1111/eva.12407		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid detection 	FALSE			FALSE	
Sousa-Santos, Carla; Pereira, Ana M.; Branco, Paulo; Costa, Goncalo J.; Santos, Jose M.; Ferreira, Maria T.; Lima, Cristina S.; Doadrio, Ignacio; Robalo, Joana, I	MITO-NUCLEAR SEQUENCING IS PARAMOUNT TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY SYMPATRIC HYBRIDIZING FISHES	ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA	Background. Hybridization may drive speciation and erode species, especially when intrageneric sympatric species are involved. Five sympatric Luciobarbus species-Luciobarbus sclateri (Gunther, 1868), Luciobarbus comizo (Steindachner, 1864), Luciobarbus microcephalus (Almaca, 1967), Luciobarbus guiraonis (Steindachner, 1866), and Luciobarbus steindachneri (Almaca, 1967)-are commonly identified in field surveys by diagnostic morphological characters. Assuming that i) in loco identification is subjective and observer-dependent, ii) there is previous evidence of interspecific hybridization, and the iii) technical reports usually do not include molecular analyses, our main goal was to assess the concordance between in loco species identification based on phenotypic characters with identifications based on morphometric indices, mtDNA only, and a combination of mito-nuclear markers. Materials and methods. Specimens of Luciobarbus from six Guadiana River sub-basins were collected and sequenced for the cytochrome b and beta-actin genes. For comparative purposes, samples of Luciobarbus from other 12 river basins were also used. Four levels of taxonomical identification were conducted based on: identification made in the field (in loco identification), cytb gene only, beta-actin gene only, and mito-nuclear combined genomes. Results. Results showed that interspecific hybridization seems to be high (around 41%) and likely favoured by non-random mating and the loss of fluvial connectivity. About 34% of the hybrids showed mito-nuclear discordance. Misidentifications were frequent when only phenotypic characters are considered, and the use of a single mitochondrial gene is not sufficient: the use of two mito-nuclear markers showed that around 82% of the in loco identifications based on the phenotype were not correct. Conclusion. Incorrect species assignment likely generated biased results in previous studies on the biology and ecology of Guadiana barbels and in the assignment of conservation status and, consequently, on the establishment of conservation management measures.	2018	10.3750/AIEP/02348		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	method	FALSE			FALSE	
Sweigart, Andrea	Sculpin hybrid zones: natural laboratories for the early stages of speciation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Firmly rooted as we are in the genomic era, it can seem incredible that as recently as 1974, Lewontin declared, 'we know virtually nothing about the genetic changes that occur in species formation'. To the contrary, we now know the genetic architecture of phenotypic differences and reproductive isolation between species for many diverse groups of plants, animals, and fungi. In recent years, detailed genetic analyses have produced a small but growing list of genes that cause reproductive isolation, several of which appear to have diverged by natural selection. Yet, a full accounting of the speciation process requires that we understand the reproductive and ecological properties of natural populations as they begin to diverge genetically, as well as the dynamics of newly evolved barriers to gene flow. One promising approach to this problem is the study of natural hybrid zones, where gene exchange between divergent populations can produce recombinant genotypes in situ. In such individuals, genomic variation might be shaped by introgression at universally adaptive or neutral loci, even as regions associated with local adaptation or reproductive isolation remain divergent. In Nolte et al. (2009), the authors take advantage of two independent, recently formed hybrid zones between sculpin species to investigate genome-wide patterns of reproductive isolation. Using a recently developed genomic clines method, the authors identify marker loci that are associated with isolation, and those that show evidence for adaptive introgression. Remarkably, Nolte et al. (2009) find little similarity between the two hybrid zones in patterns of introgression, a fact that might reflect genetic variation within species or heterogeneous natural selection. In either case, their study system has the potential to provide insight into the early stages of speciation.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04209.x		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Perspective	FALSE			FALSE	
Takahashi, Hiroshi; Toyoda, Airi; Yamazaki, Taku; Narita, Shusaku; Mashiko, Tsuyoshi; Yamazaki, Yukio	Asymmetric hybridization and introgression between sibling species of the pufferfish Takifugu that have undergone explosive speciation	MARINE BIOLOGY	Pufferfishes belonging to the genus Takifugu are a prominent example of recent adaptive radiations of marine fishes. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, the genetic characteristics of natural hybrids between two sibling species, Takifugu snyderi and Takifugu stictonotus, were investigated to gain insights into the role of hybridization in rapid diversification. Numerous early generations of hybrids (131 F-1 hybrids and 18 first-generation back-crosses) were screened by Bayesian assignment procedures from samples collected at three sites off the Pacific coast of eastern Honshu, Japan (Ibaraki: 36 degrees 21'N, 140 degrees 37'E; Fukushima: 37 degrees 03'N, 141 degrees 03'E; Iwate: 40 degrees 02'N, 141 degrees 59'E), during 2012-2014. Analysis of mtDNA indicated that hybridization is highly directional, as the majority of the F-1 hybrids (75.6%) were offspring between T. stictonotus females and T. snyderi males. Among the 18 backcrosses, 17 were toward T. snyderi and one was toward T. stictonotus. Two of 118 individuals classified as genetically pure T. snyderi based on AFLP markers were affected by mtDNA introgression from T. stictonotus. These results suggest that interspecific gene flow has been highly asymmetrical toward T. snyderi, which may partly explain the marked difference in intraspecific genetic diversity between the two species. The proportion of F-1 hybrids in the Ibaraki and Fukushima areas is exceptionally high compared with that of other marine fishes, indicating the need for continuous monitoring of hybridization and its impact on integrity of each parental species under the changing marine environment.	2017	10.1007/s00227-017-3120-2		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Recent hybrid detection 	FALSE			FALSE

Hybridization of White, Yellow, and Striped Bass in the Toledo Bend Reservoir	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST	Long-term stocking of non-native Alorone saxatihs (Striped Bass) in Toledo Bend Reservoir may have had adverse effects on the integrity of the native Morone chrysops (White Bass) and M. mississipiensis (Yellow Bass) genome through introgression. We examined microsatellite genotypes for evidence of hybridization in a sample of Striped, White, and Yellow Bass but found only four potential hybrids. Despite the introduction of millions of Striped Bass over four decades, there is no evidence for either a hybrid swarm or substantial introgression. Low numbers of hybrids may be the result of poor hybrid survival, little reproduction between species, or a combination of both.	2013	10.1656/058.012.0308		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	AFLP, no introgression 	FALSE			FALSE	
Tymchuk, WE; Devlin, RH	Growth differences among first and second generation hybrids of domesticated and wild rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	AQUACULTURE	In order to best predict the consequences of interaction between domestic and wild fish populations, the physiological and genetic differences that have occurred during the domestication process should be understood. Through production of multiple generations (F-l and F-2 backcrosses) of domestic and wild rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hybrids, the present study examines genetic changes that have occurred during domestication, as well as the action of these changes when introgressed back into a wild genome. A strong correlation observed between the proportion of domestic genes within the genotype and growth indicates that additive gene action is responsible for a large amount of the phenotypic variability.

Tymchuk, Wendy E.; Sundstrom, L. Fredrik; Devlin, Robert H.	Growth and survival trade-offs and outbreeding depression in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	EVOLUTION	The purpose of this study was to examine, using a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) model system, the fitness consequences of three generations of introgression of genotypes adapted to two different environments (culture and nature). The experiments also isolated the influence of competitive interactions and risk of predation on the relative growth and survival of the wild and backcrossed lines. Line crosses representing fast-growing pure domestic (D), slow-growing pure wild (W), domestic x wild hybrids (F1), F1 x wild backcrosses (B1), and B1 x wild backcrosses (B2) were generated and reared under (1) culture conditions, (2) seminatural conditions with competition among genotypes, and (3) seminatural conditions under risk of predation. Survival of the fry in a seminatural environment with competition fit an additive model of gene action with the domestic fish having the highest survival and the wild fish the lowest, but under risk of predation outbreeding depression was suggested by low survival of the B2 lines. Evidence of a trade-off in growth and survival under risk of predation along with observations of genetically determined behavioral differences among the strains may provide some explanation for the observed differences in survival among the strains. This information is relevant to improving our evolutionary understanding of the interaction among genomes, and the influence of environment, during hybridization events. Results from this experiment indicate that alteration of phenotype likely played a prominent role in the reduced fitness experienced by progeny produced after three generations of introgression, supporting the theory that disruption of genotypes selected for adaptation to local conditions may be a primary cause of outbreeding depression in species such as salmon.	2007	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00102.x		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	lab experiments	FALSE			FALSE	
White, Samantha L.; Sakhrani, Dionne; Danzmann, Roy G.; Devlin, Robert H.	Influence of developmental stage and genotype on liver mRNA levels among wild, domesticated, and hybrid rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Release of domesticated strains of fish into nature may pose a threat to wild populations with respect to their evolved genetic structure and fitness. Understanding alterations that have occurred in both physiology and genetics as a consequence of domestication can assist in evaluating the risks posed by introgression of domesticated genomes into wild genetic backgrounds, however the molecular causes of these consequences are currently poorly defined. The present study has examined levels of mRNA in fast-growing pure domesticated (D), slow-growing age-matched pure wild (Wa), slow-growing size-matched pure wild (Ws), and first generation hybrid cross (W/D) rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to investigate the influence of genotype (domesticated vs. wild, and their interactions in hybrids) and developmental stage (age-or size-matched animals) on genetic responses (i.e. dominant vs. recessive) and specific physiological pathways. Results: Highly significant differences in mRNA levels were found between domesticated and wild-type rainbow trout genotypes (321 mRNAs), with many mRNAs in the wild-domesticated hybrid progeny showing intermediate levels. Differences were also found between age-matched and size-matched wild-type trout groups (64 mRNAs), with unique mRNA differences for each of the wild-type groups when compared to domesticated trout (Wa: 114 mRNAs, Ws: 88 mRNAs), illustrating an influence of fish developmental stage affecting findings when used as comparator groups to other genotypes. Analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs (found for both wild-type trout to domesticated comparisons) among the genotypes indicates that 34.8% are regulated consistent with an additive genetic model, whereas 39.1% and 26.1% show a recessive or dominant mode of regulation, respectively. These molecular data are largely consistent with phenotypic data (growth and behavioural assessments) assessed in domesticated and wild trout strains. Conclusions: The present molecular data are concordant with domestication having clearly altered rainbow trout genomes and consequent phenotype from that of native wild populations. Although mainly additive responses were noted in hybrid progeny, the prevalence of dominant and non-additive responses reveals that introgression of domesticated and wild genotypes alters the type of genetic control of mRNA levels from that of wild-type, which may lead to disruption of gene regulation systems important for developing phenotypes for optimal fitness in nature. A clear influence of both fish age and size (developmental stage) on mRNA levels was also noted in this study, which highlights the importance of examining multiple control samples to provide a comprehensive understanding of changes observed between strains possessing differences in growth rate.	2013	10.1186/1471-2164-14-673		Fish			TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid lines	FALSE			FALSE

Here, we show the presence of two diverse clades, A and B, within this loach species from sequence analyses of two nuclear genes RAG1 (recombination activating gene 1) and IRBP2 (interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, 2) and then demonstrate heterozygous genotypes fixed at the two loci as the evidence of the hybrid nature of clonal lineages. All the clonal individuals were identified by clone-specific mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, microsatellite genotypes, and random amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprints; they commonly showed two alleles, one from clade A and another from clade B, whereas other wild-type diploids possessed alleles from either clade A or B. However, we also found wild-type diploids with clone-specific mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genes from clade B. One possible explanation is an introgression of a clone-specific mitochondrial genome from clonal to these wild-type loaches. These individuals likely arose by a cross between haploid sperm from bisexual B clade males and haploid eggs with clone-specific mtDNA and clade B nuclear genome, produced by meiotic hybridogenesis (elimination of unmatched A genome followed by meiosis after preferential pairing between two matched B genomes) in clone-origin triploid individual (ABB).

Bisson, Linda F.	Geographic Origin and Diversity of Wine Strains of Saccharomyces	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE	The availability of genome sequence information from a large collection of strains of Saccharomyces isolated from a variety of geographic regions and ecological niches has enabled a detailed analysis of genome composition and phenotype evolution, the two components of strain diversity. These analyses have also provided a relatively complete depiction of the origins of wine strains. In population genomic analysis, wine strains of S. cerevisiae cluster as a highly related group, but one that shows a greater level of phenotypic differentiation than would be predicted based on the level of genomic similarity. Natural and human selection and genetic drift have played roles in the evolution of wine strain diversity. Phenotypic diversity is so extensive that no one strain accurately represents all wine strains with respect to biological properties and fermentation performance. In addition, both commercial and native isolates have been found to carry introgressions, regions of DNA derived from nonhomologous organisms, suggestive of cell fusion events with yeast of different genera and species. Comparative sequence analysis has thus refined our knowledge of yeast lineages and offers explanation for the evolution of phenotypic diversity observed in winery and vineyard populations.	2012	10.5344/ajev.2012.11083		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	no measured stats	FALSE			FALSE

In vivo recombination of Saccharomyces eubayanus maltose-transporter genes yields a chimeric transporter that enables maltotriose fermentation	PLOS GENETICS	Saccharomyces eubayanus is the non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid S. pastorianus. In contrast to most S. cerevisiae and Frohberg-type S. pastorianus strains, S. eubayanus cannot utilize the -tri-glucoside maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer's wort. In Saccharomyces yeasts, utilization of maltotriose is encoded by the subtelomeric MAL gene family, and requires transporters for maltotriose uptake. While S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357(T) harbors four SeMALT genes which enable uptake of the -di-glucoside maltose, it lacks maltotriose transporter genes. In S. cerevisiae, sequence identity indicates that maltotriose and maltose transporters likely evolved from a shared ancestral gene. To study the evolvability of maltotriose utilization in S. eubayanus CBS 12357(T), maltotriose-assimilating mutants obtained after UV mutagenesis were subjected to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose, indicating gene neofunctionalization had occurred. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequences identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1 and S. eubayanus SeMALT3. Evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid S. pastorianus lager-brewing strains is therefore likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those observed in the present study. Author summary Fermentation of the wort sugar maltotriose is critical for the flavor profile obtained during beer brewing. The recently discovered yeast Saccharomyces eubayanus is gaining popularity as an alternative to S. pastorianus and S. cerevisiae for brewing, however it is unable to utilize maltotriose. Here, a combination of non-GMO mutagenesis and laboratory evolution of the S. eubayanus type strain CBS 12357(T) was used to enable maltotriose fermentation and improve brewing performance. The improved strain expressed a novel transporter gene, SeMALT413, which was formed by recombination between three different SeMALT maltose-transporter genes. Overexpression of SeMALT413 in CBS 12357(T) confirmed its neofunctionalization as a maltotriose transporter. As the S. pastorianus maltotriose transporter SpMty1 has a mosaic structure similar to SeMalT413, maltotriose utilization likely involved similar recombination events during the domestication of current lager brewing strains. Based on a posteriori sequence analysis, the emergence of gene functions has been attributed to gene neofunctionalization in a broad range of organisms. The real-time observation of neofunctionalization during laboratory evolution constitutes an important validation of the relevance and importance of this mechanism for Darwinian evolution.	2019	10.1371/journal.pgen.1007853		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	Does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Dettman, Jeremy R.; Anderson, James B.; Kohn, Linda M.	GENOME-WIDE INVESTIGATION OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IN EXPERIMENTAL LINEAGES AND NATURAL SPECIES OF NEUROSPORA: IDENTIFYING CANDIDATE REGIONS BY MICROARRAY-BASED GENOTYPING AND MAPPING	EVOLUTION	Inherent incompatibilities between genetic components from genomes of different species may cause intrinsic reproductive isolation. In evolution experiments designed to instigate speciation in laboratory populations of the filamentous fungus Neurospora, we previously discovered a pair of incompatibility loci (dfe and dma) that interact negatively to cause severe defects in sexual reproduction. Here we show that the dfe-dma incompatibility also is a significant cause of genetic isolation between two naturally occurring species of Neurospora (N. crassa and N. intermedia). The strong incompatibility interaction has a simple genetic basis (two biallelic loci) and antagonistic epistasis occurs between heterospecific alleles only, consistent with the Dobzhansky-Muller model of genic incompatibility. We developed microarray-based, restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) markers that identified similar to 1500 polymorphisms between the genomes of the two species, and constructed the first interspecific physical map of Neurospora. With this new mapping resource, the approximate genomic locations of the incompatibility loci were determined using three different approaches: genome scanning, bulk-segregant analyses, and introgression. These population, quantitative, and classical genetics methods concordantly identified two candidate regions, narrowing the search for each incompatibility locus to only similar to 2% of the nuclear genome. This study demonstrates how advances in high-throughput, genome-wide genotyping can be applied to mapping reproductive isolation genes and speciation research.	2010	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00863.x		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	experimental introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Dujon, Bernard	Basic principles of yeast genomics, a personal recollection	FEMS YEAST RESEARCH	The genomes of many yeast species or strain isolates have now been sequenced with an accelerating momentum that quickly relegates initial data to history, albeit that they are less than two decades old. Today, novel yeast genomes are entirely sequenced for a variety of reasons, often only to identify a few expected genes of specific interest, thus providing a wealth of data, heterogenous in quality and completion but informative about the origin and evolution of this heterogeneous collection of unicellular modern fungi. However, how many scientists fully appreciate the important conceptual and technological roles played by yeasts in the extraordinary development of today's genomics? Novel notions of general significance emerged from the very first eukaryote sequenced, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and were successively refined and extended over time. Tools with general applications were originally developed with this yeast; and surprises emerged from the results. Here, I have tried to recollect the gradual building up of knowledge as yeast genomics developed, and then briefly summarize our present views about the basic nature of yeast genomes, based on the most recent data.	2015	10.1093/femsyr/fov047		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	review	FALSE			FALSE	
Dunn, Barbara; Paulish, Terry; Stanbery, Alison; Piotrowski, Jeff; Koniges, Gregory; Kroll, Evgueny; Louis, Edward J.; Liti, Gianni; Sherlock, Gavin; Rosenzweig, Frank	Recurrent Rearrangement during Adaptive Evolution in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid Suggests a Model for Rapid Introgression	PLOS GENETICS	Genome rearrangements are associated with eukaryotic evolutionary processes ranging from tumorigenesis to speciation. Rearrangements are especially common following interspecific hybridization, and some of these could be expected to have strong selective value. To test this expectation we created de novo interspecific yeast hybrids between two diverged but largely syntenic Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, then experimentally evolved them under continuous ammonium limitation. We discovered that a characteristic interspecific genome rearrangement arose multiple times in independently evolved populations. We uncovered nine different breakpoints, all occurring in a narrow similar to 1-kb region of chromosome 14, and all producing an "interspecific fusion junction" within the MEP2 gene coding sequence, such that the 59 portion derives from S. cerevisiae and the 39 portion derives from S. uvarum. In most cases the rearrangements altered both chromosomes, resulting in what can be considered to be an introgression of a several-kb region of S. uvarum into an otherwise intact S. cerevisiae chromosome 14, while the homeologous S. uvarum chromosome 14 experienced an interspecific reciprocal translocation at the same breakpoint within MEP2, yielding a chimaeric chromosome; these events result in the presence in the cell of two MEP2 fusion genes having identical breakpoints. Given that MEP2 encodes for a high-affinity ammonium permease, that MEP2 fusion genes arise repeatedly under ammonium-limitation, and that three independent evolved isolates carrying MEP2 fusion genes are each more fit than their common ancestor, the novel MEP2 fusion genes are very likely adaptive under ammonium limitation. Our results suggest that, when homoploid hybrids form, the admixture of two genomes enables swift and otherwise unavailable evolutionary innovations. Furthermore, the architecture of the MEP2 rearrangement suggests a model for rapid introgression, a phenomenon seen in numerous eukaryotic phyla, that does not require repeated backcrossing to one of the parental species.	2013	10.1371/journal.pgen.1003366		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE

Gladieux, Pierre; Wilson, Benjamin A.; Perraudeau, Fanny; Montoya, Liliam A.; Kowbel, David; Hann-Soden, Christopher; Fischer, Monika; Sylvain, Iman; Jacobson, David J.; Taylor, John W.	Genomic sequencing reveals historical, demographic and selective factors associated with the diversification of the fire-associated fungus Neurospora discreta	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Delineating microbial populations, discovering ecologically relevant phenotypes and identifying migrants, hybrids or admixed individuals have long proved notoriously difficult, thereby limiting our understanding of the evolutionary forces at play during the diversification of microbial species. However, recent advances in sequencing and computational methods have enabled an unbiased approach whereby incipient species and the genetic correlates of speciation can be identified by examining patterns of genomic variation within and between lineages. We present here a population genomic study of a phylogenetic species in the Neurospora discreta species complex, based on the resequencing of full genomes (similar to 37 Mb) for 52 fungal isolates from nine sites in three continents. Population structure analyses revealed two distinct lineages in South-East Asia, and three lineages in North America/Europe with a broad longitudinal and latitudinal range and limited admixture between lineages. Genome scans for selective sweeps and comparisons of the genomic landscapes of diversity and recombination provided no support for a role of selection at linked sites on genomic heterogeneity in levels of divergence between lineages. However, demographic inference indicated that the observed genomic heterogeneity in divergence was generated by varying rates of gene flow between lineages following a period of isolation. Many putative cases of exchange of genetic material between phylogenetically divergent fungal lineages have been discovered, and our work highlights the quantitative importance of genetic exchanges between more closely related taxa to the evolution of fungal genomes. Our study also supports the role of allopatric isolation as a driver of diversification in saprobic microbes.	2015	10.1111/mec.13417		Fungi			TRUE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Heil, Caiti S. Smukowski; Large, Christopher R. L.; Patterson, Kira; Hickey, Angela Shang-Mei; Yeh, Chiann-Ling C.; Dunham, Maitreya J.	Temperature preference can bias parental genome retention during hybrid evolution	PLOS GENETICS	Author summary Organisms are facing rapid alterations to their habitat due to climate change, the introduction of invasive species, habitat fragmentation, and other human mediated transformations. How species will survive and adapt to these changes is one of the biggest questions of our time. Hybridization, or the mating of different species, offers a potential solution, as it immediately introduces novel genetic variation genome wide. To investigate how hybrids adapt to new environments, and how the environment influences hybrid genomes, we created hybrid yeast in the lab and evolved them under different nutrient limited conditions and at different temperature regimes for hundreds of generations. We show that genetic variation introduced from a cold tolerant species of yeast helps a hybrid adapt to a phosphate-limited cold temperature environment, and thus that the environment can influence which species' genes persist and which species' genes are lost in the generations following a hybridization event. Interspecific hybridization can introduce genetic variation that aids in adaptation to new or changing environments. Here, we investigate how hybrid adaptation to temperature and nutrient limitation may alter parental genome representation over time. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces uvarum hybrids in nutrient-limited continuous culture at 15 degrees C for 200 generations. In comparison to previous evolution experiments at 30 degrees C, we identified a number of responses only observed in the colder temperature regime, including the loss of the S. cerevisiae allele in favor of the cryotolerant S. uvarum allele for several portions of the hybrid genome. In particular, we discovered a genotype by environment interaction in the form of a loss of heterozygosity event on chromosome XIII; which species' haplotype is lost or maintained is dependent on the parental species' temperature preference and the temperature at which the hybrid was evolved. We show that a large contribution to this directionality is due to a temperature dependent fitness benefit at a single locus, the high affinity phosphate transporter gene PHO84. This work helps shape our understanding of what forces impact genome evolution after hybridization, and how environmental conditions may promote or disfavor the persistence of hybrids over time.	2019	10.1371/journal.pgen.1008383		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	Experimental cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Karanyicz, Edina; Antunovics, Zsuzsa; Kallai, Z.; Sipiczki, M.	Non-introgressive genome chimerisation by malsegregation in autodiploidised allotetraploids during meiosis of Saccharomyces kudriavzevii x Saccharomyces uvarum hybrids	APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY	Saccharomyces strains with chimerical genomes consisting of mosaics of the genomes of different species ("natural hybrids") occur quite frequently among industrial and wine strains. The most widely endorsed hypothesis is that the mosaics are introgressions acquired via hybridisation and repeated backcrosses of the hybrids with one of the parental species. However, the interspecies hybrids are sterile, unable to mate with their parents. Here, we show by analysing synthetic Saccharomyces kudriavzevii x Saccharomyces uvarum hybrids that mosaic (chimeric) genomes can arise without introgressive backcrosses. These species are biologically separated by a double sterility barrier (sterility of allodiploids and F1 sterility of allotetraploids). F1 sterility is due to the diploidisation of the tetraploid meiosis resulting in MAT a /MAT alpha heterozygosity which suppresses mating in the spores. This barrier can occasionally be broken down by malsegregation of autosyndetically paired chromosomes carrying the MAT loci (loss of MAT heterozygosity). Subsequent malsegregation of additional autosyndetically paired chromosomes and occasional allosyndetic interactions chimerise the hybrid genome. Chromosomes are preferentially lost from the S. kudriavzevii subgenome. The uniparental transmission of the mitochondrial DNA to the hybrids indicates that nucleo-mitochondrial interactions might affect the direction of the genomic changes. We propose the name GARMe (Genome AutoReduction in Meiosis) for this process of genome reduction and chimerisation which involves no introgressive backcrossings. It opens a way to transfer genetic information between species and thus to get one step ahead after hybridisation in the production of yeast strains with beneficial combinations of properties of different species.	2017	10.1007/s00253-017-8274-9		Fungi			TRUE	FALSE	Lab crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Lancaster, Samuel M.; Payen, Celia; Heil, Caiti Smukowski; Dunham, Maitreya J.	Fitness benefits of loss of heterozygosity in Saccharomyces hybrids	GENOME RESEARCH	With two genomes in the same organism, interspecific hybrids have unique fitness opportunities and costs. In both plants and yeasts, wild, pathogenic, and domesticated hybrids may eliminate portions of one parental genome, a phenomenon known as loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Laboratory evolution of hybrid yeast recapitulates these results, with LOH occurring in just a few hundred generations of propagation. In this study, we systematically looked for alleles that are beneficial when lost in order to determine how prevalent this mode of adaptation may be and to determine candidate loci that might underlie the benefits of larger-scale chromosome rearrangements. These aims were accomplished by mating Saccharomyces uvarum with the S. cerevisiae deletion collection to create hybrids such that each nonessential S. cerevisiae allele is deleted. Competitive fitness assays of these pooled, barcoded, hemizygous strains, and accompanying controls, revealed a large number of loci for which LOH is beneficial. We found that the fitness effects of hemizygosity are dependent on the species context, the selective environment, and the species origin of the deleted allele. Further, we found that hybrids have a wider distribution of fitness consequences versus matched S. cerevisiae hemizygous diploids. Our results suggest that LOH can be a successful strategy for adaptation of hybrids to new environments, and we identify candidate loci that drive the chromosomal rearrangements observed in evolution of yeast hybrids.	2019	10.1101/gr.245605.118		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	Lab hybrids	FALSE			FALSE	
Marsit, Souhir; Dequin, Sylvie	Diversity and adaptive evolution of Saccharomyces wine yeast: a review	FEMS YEAST RESEARCH	Saccharomyces cerevisiae and related species, the main workhorses of wine fermentation, have been exposed to stressful conditions for millennia, potentially resulting in adaptive differentiation. As a result, wine yeasts have recently attracted considerable interest for studying the evolutionary effects of domestication. The widespread use of whole-genome sequencing during the last decade has provided new insights into the biodiversity, population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary history of wine yeasts. Comparisons between S. cerevisiae isolates from various origins have indicated that a variety of mechanisms, including heterozygosity, nucleotide and structural variations, introgressions, horizontal gene transfer and hybridization, contribute to the genetic and phenotypic diversity of S. cerevisiae. This review will summarize the current knowledge on the diversity and evolutionary history of wine yeasts, focusing on the domestication fingerprints identified in these strains.	2015	10.1093/femsyr/fov067		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	review	FALSE			FALSE	
Maxwell, Colin S.; Mattox, Kathleen; Turissini, David A.; Teixeira, Marcus M.; Barker, Bridget M.; Matute, Daniel R.	Gene exchange between two divergent species of the fungal human pathogen, Coccidioides	EVOLUTION	The fungal genus Coccidioides is composed of two species, Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. These two species are the causal agents of coccidioidomycosis, a pulmonary disease also known as valley fever. The two species are thought to have shared genetic material due to gene exchange in spite of their long divergence. To quantify the magnitude of shared ancestry between them, we analyzed the genomes of a population sample from each species. Next, we inferred what is the expected size of shared haplotypes that might be inherited from the last common ancestor of the two species and find a cutoff to find what haplotypes have conclusively been exchanged between species. Finally, we precisely identified the breakpoints of the haplotypes that have crossed the species boundary and measure the allele frequency of each introgression in this sample. We find that introgressions are not uniformly distributed across the genome. Most, but not all, of the introgressions segregate at low frequency. Our results show that divergent species can share alleles, that species boundaries can be porous, and highlight the need for a systematic exploration of gene exchange in fungal species.	2019	10.1111/evo.13643		Fungi			TRUE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Molecular phylogeny of pectinase genes PGU in the yeast genus Saccharomyces	MICROBIOLOGY	Using yeast genome databases and literature data, phylogenetic analysis of pectinase PGU genes from 112 Saccharomyces strains assigned to the biological species S. arboricola, S. bayanus (var. uvarum), S. cariocanus, S. cerevisiae, S. kudriavzevii, S. mikatae, S. paradoxus, and the hybrid taxon S. pastorianus (syn. S. carlsbergensis) was carried out. A superfamily of divergent PGU genes was found. Natural interspecies transfer of the PGU gene both from S. cerevisiae to S. bayanus and from S. paradoxus to S. cerevisiae may, however, occur. Within the Saccharomyces species, identity of the PGU nucleotide sequences was 98.8-100% for S. cerevisiae, 86.1-95.7% for S. bayanus (var. uvarum), 94-98.3% for S. kudriavzevii, and 96.8-100% for S. paradoxus/S. cariocanus. For the first time, a family of polymeric PGU1b, PGU2b, PGU3b and PGU4b genes is documented for the yeast S. bayanus var. uvarum, a variety important for winemaking.	2016	10.1134/S0026261716060163		Fungi			TRUE	TRUE	Distances	FALSE			FALSE

Ancestral Admixture Is the Main Determinant of Global Biodiversity in Fission Yeast	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Mutation and recombination are key evolutionary processes governing phenotypic variation and reproductive isolation. We here demonstrate that biodiversity within all globally known strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe arose through admixture between two divergent ancestral lineages. Initial hybridization was inferred to have occurred similar to 20-60 sexual outcrossing generations ago consistent with recent, human-induced migration at the onset of intensified transcontinental trade. Species-wide heritable phenotypic variation was explained near-exclusively by strain-specific arrangements of alternating ancestry components with evidence for transgressive segregation. Reproductive compatibility between strains was likewise predicted by the degree of shared ancestry. To assess the genetic determinants of ancestry block distribution across the genome, we characterized the type, frequency, and position of structural genomic variation using nanopore and single-molecule real-time sequencing. Despite being associated with double-strand break initiation points, over 800 segregating structural variants exerted overall little influence on the introgression landscape or on reproductive compatibility between strains. In contrast, we found strong ancestry disequilibrium consistent with negative epistatic selection shaping genomic ancestry combinations during the course of hybridization. This study provides a detailed, experimentally tractable example that genomes of natural populations are mosaics reflecting different evolutionary histories. Exploiting genome-wide heterogeneity in the history of ancestral recombination and lineage-specific mutations sheds new light on the population history of S. pombe and highlights the importance of hybridization as a creative force in generating biodiversity.	2019	10.1093/molbev/msz126		Fungi			TRUE	FALSE	Tajima's D	FALSE			FALSE

Phylogeography of the fire-bellied toads Bombina: independent Pleistocene histories inferred from mitochondrial genomes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and Bombina variegata, interbreed in a long, narrow zone maintained by a balance between selection and dispersal. Hybridization takes place between local, genetically differentiated groups. To quantify divergence between these groups and reconstruct their history and demography, we analysed nucleotide variation at the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1096 bp) in 364 individuals from 156 sites representing the entire range of both species. Three distinct clades with high sequence divergence (K2P = 8-11%) were distinguished. One clade grouped B. bombina haplotypes; the two other clades grouped B. variegata haplotypes. One B. variegata clade included only Carpathian individuals; the other represented B. variegata from the southwestern parts of its distribution: Southern and Western Europe (Balkano-Western lineage), Apennines, and the Rhodope Mountains. Differentiation between the Carpathian and Balkano-Western lineages, K2P similar to 8%, approached interspecific divergence. Deep divergence among European Bombina lineages suggests their preglacial origin, and implies long and largely independent evolutionary histories of the species. Multiple glacial refugia were identified in the lowlands adjoining the Black Sea, in the Carpathians, in the Balkans, and in the Apennines. The results of the nested clade and demographic analyses suggest drastic reductions of population sizes during the last glacial period, and significant demographic growth related to postglacial colonization. Inferred history, supported by fossil evidence, demonstrates that Bombina ranges underwent repeated contractions and expansions. Geographical concordance between morphology, allozymes, and mtDNA shows that previous episodes of interspecific hybridization have left no detectable mtDNA introgression. Either the admixed populations went extinct, or selection against hybrids hindered mtDNA gene flow in ancient hybrid zones.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03309.x		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE	mitochondrial		FALSE	
Jancuchova-Laskova, Jitka; Landova, Eva; Frynta, Daniel	Are genetically distinct lizard species able to hybridize? A review	CURRENT ZOOLOGY	Animal species are delimited by reproductive isolation mechanisms (RIMs). Postzygotic RIMs are mainly products of genetic differences and thus their strength increases with elapsed divergence time. The relationship between postzygotic reproductive isolation and genetic divergence, however, differs considerably among major clades of vertebrates. We reviewed the available literature providing empirical evidence of natural and/or experimental hybridization between distinct species of lizards (squamates except snakes). We found that hybridization events are widely distributed among nearly all major lizard clades. The majority of research focuses on parthenogenetic species and/or polyploid hybrids in families Lacertidae, Teiidae and Gekkonidae. Homoploid bisexual hybrids are mainly reported within Lacertidae and Iguania groups. As a proxy of genetic divergence of the hybridizing taxa we adopted nucleotide sequence distance (HKY85) of mitochondrial cyt b gene. The upper limit of genetic divergence was similar with regard to both parthenogenetic and bisexual hybrids. Maximum values of these distances between hybridizing species of lizards approached 18%-21%, which is comparable to or even exceeds the corresponding values reported for other principal clades of vertebrates. In spite of this, F-1 hybrids are typically at least partially fertile in lizards and thus genetic introgression between highly divergent species is possible.

Mitochondrial Heteroplasmy in Marsh Frog (Pelophylax ridibundus Pallas, 1771)	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	The population features of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of P. ridibundus Pallas, 1771 and related species of green frogs from Nizhny Novgorod and Sverdlovsk oblasts were investigated for the first time. The existence of the R-E-L population system on the territory of Nizhny Novgorod oblast was confirmed. The presence of heteroplasmy was found in all examined samples of marsh frogs, as well as in hybrid, edible, frogs. These findings indicate the presence of hybridization and introgressions that took place in the history of the studied forms of each of the species. Considerable heterogeneity of animals from the territory of Sverdlovsk oblast in the nuclear and to a higher degree in the mitochondrial genome was demonstrated, which with high probability indicates that the populations existing in this territory originated from multiple introductions. The obtained data characterize the state of population systems, as well as the history of the formation of the modern phylogenogeographic pattern of green frogs on the studied territories.	2019	10.1134/S1022795419080179		Amphibian			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Significant genetic variability was detected in most of the loci and all populations. Allozyme pairwise F (ST) matrices and distribution of allele frequencies indicate their very close genetic relationships and relatively recent formation. Mean genetic distance values between Thracian and Anatolian populations indicate a Middle or Upper Pleistocene lineage separation before the formation of the Bosporus as an isolating geographic barrier. All the samples show substantial heterozygosity excess, and there was statistically significant evidence of recent bottlenecks. The extent and patterns of genetic divergence indicate that the Anatolian and Thracian populations have probably experienced bottlenecks, and incipient speciation may have occurred in Anatolian populations of B. bombina.	2010	10.1007/s10528-009-9305-8		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	didn't calculate introgression	FALSE			FALSE

The Case of Mito-nuclear Genetic Divergence in Chameleons	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Compatibility between the nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes is important for organismal health. However, its significance for major evolutionary processes such as speciation is unclear, especially in vertebrates. We previously identified a sharp mtDNA-specific sequence divergence between morphologically indistinguishable chameleon populations (Chamaeleo chamaeleon recticrista) across an ancient Israeli marine barrier (Jezreel Valley). Because mtDNA introgression and gender-based dispersal were ruled out, we hypothesized that mtDNA spatial division was maintained by mito-nuclear functional compensation. Here, we studied RNA-seq generated from each of ten chameleons representing the north and south populations and identified candidate nonsynonymous substitutions (NSSs) matching the mtDNA spatial distribution. The most prominent NSS occurred in 14 nDNA-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Increased chameleon sample size (N = 70) confirmed the geographic differentiation in POLRMT, NDUFA5, ACO1, LYRM4, MARS2, and ACAD9. Structural and functionality evaluation of these NSSs revealed high functionality. Mathematical modeling suggested that this mito-nuclear spatial divergence is consistent with hybrid breakdown. We conclude that our presented evidence and mathematical model underline mito-nuclear interactions as a likely role player in incipient speciation in vertebrates.	2015	10.1093/gbe/evv226		Reptiles			TRUE	TRUE	mtDNA and din't claim introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Cavlovic, Kristina; Buj, Ivana; Karaica, Dean; Jelic, Dusan; Choleva, Lukas	Composition and age structure of the Pelophylax esculentus complex (Anura; Ranidae) population in inland Croatia	SALAMANDRA	Pelophylax esculentus is a vertebrate animal with hemiclonal heredity, attracting the interest of many reproductive and evolutionary biologists. It is a hybrid between P. ridibundus and P. lessonae. These three taxa form the so-called Pelophylax esculentus complex with a population structure usually comprising a hybrid taxa and one parental species. Data on population types at the southernmost distribution area of their sympatry are rare. Here we sampled five sites in inland Croatia in order to analyse the population structure, sex ratio and age structure. The individual genotypes of 93 randomly collected water frogs were verified with allozyme markers for three species-specific polymorphic loci. In order to estimate population age structure, the annual growth rate (skeletochronology) and growth index profiles were also investigated. The growth index profiles were analysed by an estimation of number of lines of arrested growth visible in the cross-section of femur bones. Our results revealed the presence of the R-E-L population with a dominance of P. esculentus. Pelophylax ridibundus was the least abundant taxon but with a relatively high age estimate of eight years on average. Its annual growth rate did not differ from the remaining two species. Gene introgression of mostly ridibundus alleles was also observed in hybrids. Most profiles of gonads in hybrids showed presence of both parental genomes with dominance of ridibundus alleles. The study area represents one of the southernmost distributions of the hybrid taxon in Europe, making it attractive to study gene flow and impact of P. esculentus on P. ridibundus, a typical water frog representative of the Balkan Peninsula.	2018			Amphibian			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Charney, Noah D.	RELATING HYBRID ADVANTAGE AND GENOME REPLACEMENT IN UNISEXUAL SALAMANDERS	EVOLUTION	Unisexual vertebrates are model systems for understanding the evolution of sex. Many predominantly clonal lineages allow occasional genetic recombination, which may be sufficient to avoid the accumulation of deleterious mutations and parasites. Introgression of paternal DNA into an all-female lineage represents a one-way flow of genetic material. Over many generations, this could result in complete replacement of the unisexual genomes by those of the donor species. The process of genome replacement may be counteracted by contemporary dispersal or by positive selection on hybrid nuclear genomes in ecotones. I present a conceptual model that relates nuclear genome replacement, positive selection on hybrids and biogeography in unisexual systems. I execute an individual-based simulation of the fate of hybrid genotypes in contact with a single host species. I parameterize these models for unisexual salamanders in the Ambystoma genus, for which the frequency of genome replacement has been a source of ongoing debate. I find that, if genome replacement occurs at a rate greater than 1/10,000 in Ambystoma, then there must be compensating positive selection in order to maintain observed levels of hybrid nuclei. Future researchers studying unisexual systems may use this framework as a guide to evaluating the hybrid superiority hypothesis.	2012	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01523.x		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	weird "uniparental" introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Hauswaldt, J. Susanne; Vences, Miguel; Louis, Edward; Brennemann, Rick; Ziegler, Thomas	GENETIC SCREENING OF CAPTIVE PHILIPPINE CROCODILES (CROCODYLUS MINDORENSIS) AS PREREQUISITE FOR STARTING A CONSERVATION BREEDING PROGRAM IN EUROPE	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY	Philippine Crocodiles (Crocodylus mindorensis) are among the rarest crocodilians worldwide. Captive propagation for building up a conservation breeding and reserve population in Europe has recently been undertaken as a management action. For this purpose, 15 presumed C. mindorensis all originating from a captive source in the Philippines were brought to different facilities in Europe in 2006. Identification of hybrid individuals, deriving from crosses of the Philippine Crocodile with the Saltwater Crocodile (C. porosus) at a captive breeding facility in the Philippines prompted us to undertake a genetic screening of the European individuals to determine whether evidence for hybridization could be detected. We sequenced the 14 remaining C. mindorensis individuals, five additional C. mindorensis from other sources, and two C. porosus for two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene fragments. No evidence of C. porosus introgression was detected in 18 of the presumed pure C. mindorensis; however, we found one presumed pure C. mindorensis to be a Western Nile Crocodile (western lineage of C. niloticus sensu lato, proposed to be named C. suchus by Schmitz et al. 2003). Both C. porosus individuals were in genetic agreement with known C. porosus gene sequences. Of the three nuclear markers, LDH-A was most informative to discriminate between C. mindorensis and C. porosus. With this first genetic screening, an important step towards a proper European conservation breeding program has been made.	2013			Reptiles			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE

In this study, we use water frogs of the Pelophylax esculentus complex, comprising two species (Pelophylax lessonae, genotype LL; Pelophylax ridibundus, RR) and various diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR, LRR) hybrid forms, summarized as P.esculentus, as a model for studying recent hybridization and polyploidization in the context of speciation. Specifically, we compared the geographic distribution and genetic diversity of diploid and triploid hybrids across Europe to understand their origin, maintenance and potential role in hybrid speciation. We found that different hybrid and parental genotypes are not evenly distributed across Europe. Rather, their genetic diversity is structured by latitude and longitude and the presence/absence of parental species but not of triploids. Highest genetic diversity was observed in central and eastern Europe, the lowest in the northwestern parts of Europe. This gradient can be explained by the decrease in genetic diversity during postglacial expansion from southeastern glacial refuge areas. Genealogical relationships calculated on the basis of microsatellite data clearly indicate that hybrids are of multiple origin and include a huge variety of parental genomes. Water frogs in mixed-ploidy populations without any parental species (i.e. all-hybrid populations) can be viewed as evolutionary units that may be on their way towards hybrid speciation. Maintenance of such all-hybrid populations requires a continuous exchange of genomes between diploids and triploids, but scenarios for alternative evolutionary trajectories are discussed.	2015	10.1111/mec.13325		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Leuenberger, Julien; Gander, Antoine; Schmidt, Benedikt R.; Perrin, Nicolas	Are invasive marsh frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus) replacing the native P. lessonae/P. esculentus hybridogenetic complex in Western Europe? Genetic evidence from a field study	CONSERVATION GENETICS	The water-frog L-E system, widespread in Western Europe, comprises the pool frog Pelophylax lessonae and the hybridogenetic edible frog P. esculentus, which originated from hybridization between pool frogs and marsh frogs (P. ridibundus). In P. esculentus, the lessonae (L) genome is eliminated during meiosis and has to be gained anew each generation from a P. lessonae partner, while the ridibundus (R') genome is transmitted clonally. It therefore accumulates deleterious mutations, so that R'R' offspring from P. esculentusxP. esculentus crosses are normally unviable. This system is now threatened by invasive P. ridibundus (RR) imported from Eastern Europe and the Balkans. We investigated the genetic interactions between invasive marsh frogs and native water frogs in a Swiss wetland area, and used genetic data collected in the field to validate several components of a recently postulated mechanism of species replacement. We identified neo-ridibundus individuals derived from crosses between invasive ridibundus and native esculentus, as well as newly arisen hybridogenetic esculentus lineages stemming from crosses between invasive ridibundus (RR) and native lessonae (LL). As their ridibundus genomes are likely to carry less deleterious mutations, such lineages are expected to produce viable ridibundus offspring, contributing to species replacement. However, such crosses with invasive ridibundus only occurred at a limited scale; moreover, RRxLL crosses did not induce any introgression from the ridibundus to the lessonae genome. We did not find any ridibundus stemming from crosses between ancient esculentus lineages. Despite several decades of presence on the site, introduced ridibundus individuals only represent 15 % of sampled frogs, and their spatial distribution seems shaped by specific ecological requirements rather than history of colonization. We therefore expect the three taxa to coexist stably in this area.	2014	10.1007/s10592-014-0585-0		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats	FALSE			FALSE

Pabijan, Maciej; Spolsky, Christina; Uzzell, Thomas; Szymura, Jacek M.	Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes in Bombina (Anura; Bombinatoridae)	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION	The complete mitochondrial genomes of two basal anurans, Bombina bombina and B. variegata (Anura; Bombinatoridae), were sequenced. The gene order of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is identical to that of canonical vertebrate mtDNA. In contrast, we show that there are structural differences in regulatory regions and protein coding genes between the mtDNA of these two closely related species. Corrected sequence divergence between the mtDNA of B. bombina and B. variegata amounts to 8.7% (2.3% divergence in amino acids). Comparisons with two East Asian congeners show that the control region contains two repeat regions, LV1 and LV2, present in all species except for B. bombina, in which LV2 has been secondarily lost. The rRNAs and tRNAs are characterized by low nucleotide divergence. The protein coding genes are considerably more disparate, although functional constraint is high but variable among genes, as evidenced by dN/dS ratios. A mtDNA phylogeny established the distribution of autapomorphic nonsynonomous substitutions in the mitogenomes of B. bombina and B. variegata. Nine of 98 nonsynonomous substitutions led to radical amino acid replacements that may alter mitochondrial protein function. Most radical substitutions were found in ND2, ND4, or ND5, encoding mitochondrial subunits of complex I of the electron transport system. The extensive divergence between the mitogenomes of B. bombina and B. variegata is discussed in terms of its possible role in impeding gene flow in natural hybrid zones between these two species.	2008	10.1007/s00239-008-9123-3		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data strongly indicate that the ancestors of these two frogs did not arrive on Cyprus via a land bridge or overseas dispersal but were unintentionally introduced by humans, most probably together with carp fingerlings. Both individuals exhibited recombined nuclear genomes characteristic of backcross hybrids. Further investigations are needed to estimate the amount of introgression of allochthonous alleles into the gene pool of P. cypriensis.	2015	10.1080/09397140.2015.1027495		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Quilodran, Claudio S.; Montoya-Burgos, Juan I.; Currat, Mathias	Modelling interspecific hybridization with genome exclusion to identify conservation actions: the case of native and invasive Pelophylax waterfrogs	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Interspecific hybridization occurs in nature but can also be caused by human actions. It often leads to infertile or fertile hybrids that exclude one parental genome during gametogenesis, escaping genetic recombination and introgression. The threat that genome-exclusion hybridization might represent on parental species is poorly understood, especially when invasive species are involved. Here, we show how to assess the effects of genome-exclusion hybridization and how to elaborate conservation actions by simulating scenarios using a model of nonintrogressive hybridization. We examine the case of the frog Pelophylax ridibundus, introduced in Western Europe, which can hybridize with the native Pelophylax lessonae and the pre-existing hybrid Pelophylax esculentus, maintained by hybridogenesis. If translocated from Southern Europe, P.ridibundus produces new sterile hybrids and we show that it mainly threatens P.esculentus. Translocation from Central Europe leads to new fertile hybrids, threatening all native waterfrogs. Local extinction is demographically mediated via wasted reproductive potential or via demographic flow through generations towards P.ridibundus. We reveal that enlarging the habitat size of the native P.lessonae relative to that of the invader is a promising conservation strategy, avoiding the difficulties of fighting the invader. We finally stress that nonintrogressive hybridization is to be considered in conservation programmes.	2015	10.1111/eva.12245		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE

G.; Luz, Pedro B.; Machado, Rodrigo; Lo, Rachel; McDaniel, Stuart F.; Payton, Adam C.; Waltzek, Thomas B.; Wayne, Marta L.	Effects of hybridization on sea turtle fitness	CONSERVATION GENETICS	Sea turtle hybridization is a common phenomenon in Brazil between loggerheads (Caretta caretta) and hawksbills (Eretmochelys imbricata) as well as between loggerheads and olive ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea). In a previous study we showed that the reproductive output of loggerhead/hawksbill hybrids is similar to that of parental species, suggesting no negative effect of hybridization at this life stage. In this study, we used pooled amplicon sequencing to assign species identity to dams and their progeny, and to investigate the fitness consequences of hybridization, using hatchling viability as a proxy for fitness. We genotyped 4829 hatchlings from egg clutches laid by 78 loggerheads, 13 hawksbills, seven loggerhead/hawksbill hybrids, and three loggerhead/olive ridley hybrids. The proportion of viable hybrid (heterozygous) hatchlings was similar to that of homozygous hatchlings (based on data at two loci), independent of the dam's genotype. Multiple species paternity was observed in 35.7% of the nests. Both hybrid males and females were fertile and produced viable offspring, and we found no evidence for hybrid breakdown. We suggest a genome-wide study of the hybrids and parental species to better characterize hybrids, as well as studies on additional demographic and ecological parameters to further assess the effects of hybridization and its consequences for sea turtles and their environment.	2018	10.1007/s10592-018-1101-8		Reptiles			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Stuglik, Michal T.; Babik, Wieslaw	Genomic heterogeneity of historical gene flow between two species of newts inferred from transcriptome data	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The role of gene flow in species formation is a major unresolved issue in speciation biology. Progress in this area requires information on the long-term patterns of gene flow between diverging species. Here, we used thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms derived from transcriptome resequencing and a method modeling the joint frequency spectrum of these polymorphisms to reconstruct patterns of historical gene flow between two Lissotriton newts: L. vulgaris (Lv) and L. montandoni (Lm). We tested several models of divergence including complete isolation and various scenarios of historical gene flow. The model of secondary contact received the highest support. According to this model, the species split from their common ancestor ca. 5.5 million years (MY) ago, evolved in isolation for ca. 2 MY, and have been exchanging genes for the last 3.5 MY Demographic changes have been inferred in both species, with the current effective population size of ca. 0.7 million in Lv and 0.2 million in Lm. The postdivergence gene flow resulted in two-directional introgression which affected the genomes of both species, but was more pronounced from Lv to Lm. Interestingly, we found evidence for genomic heterogeneity of interspecific gene flow. This study demonstrates the complexity of long-term gene flow between distinct but incompletely reproductively isolated taxa which divergence was initiated millions of years ago.	2016	10.1002/ece3.2152		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE

Rumors or anecdotal concerns have existed for some time as to the possibility of hybrid individuals existing in a captive collection under consideration for providing reintroduction candidates; however, visual observations failed to identify suspected hybrids. Samples were collected from 619 Philippine crocodiles from several captive facilities and two free-ranging populations. Mitochondrial DNA D-loop (601 bp) fragments were sequenced for each crocodile and compared to 28 individuals representing ten crocodile species. Among Philippine crocodiles, 48 variable sites (47 parsimony informative sites) were identified, which defined six C. mindorensis haplotypes and one C. porosus-derived haplotype. Data were also generated for a 965 bp fragment of the ND4 subunit gene fragment for two samples of each D-loop haplotype. Among them, 91 variable sites (90 parsimony informative site) were identified, which defined three C. mindorensis haplotypes and one C. porosus-derived haplotype. From the nuclear genome, the C-mos gene was successfully amplified for the 388 bp partial fragment for all Philippine crocodile samples. Only two variable sites were identified. These sequences were compared to GenBank sequences for C. porosus. Of the 619 Philippine crocodile samples, 57 samples were found to harbor D-loop haplotypes identified as C. porosus and 31 of those harbored C-mos mutational sites diagnostic for C. porosus introgression. All individuals indicating C. mindorensis x C. porosus hybridization were sampled from the Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center.	2012			Reptiles			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Wilcox, Jeffery T.; Padgett-Flohr, Gretchen E.; Alvarez, Jeff A.; Johnson, Jarrett R.	Possible Phenotypic Influence of Superinvasive Alleles on Larval California Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma californiense)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST	California tiger salamanders (Ambystoma californiense) exhibit an obligate metamorphic life history strategy in which aquatic larvae metamorphose into terrestrial juveniles early each summer. However, we have recently documented two occurrences of populations containing large gilled California tiger salamander larvae during the winter months. Large gilled larvae could be the result of genetic admixture between California tiger salamanders and an introduced congener, the barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium), but the population occurrences we observed are located outside the presumed extent of the A. californiense/ A. t. mavortium-hybrid swarm. We used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate the possibility the genomes of these atypical larvae have been introgressed by "superinvasive'' loci that have escaped from the established hybrid swarm. We also discuss the possibility the overwintering larval phenotypes may be the result of increased prevalence of large, fishless, semipermanent ponds, or of a combination of both introgression and habitat modification.	2015	10.1674/0003-0031-173.1.168		Amphibian			TRUE	TRUE	no stats of interest 	FALSE			FALSE

Anderson, Kirk E.; Novak, Stephen J.; Smith, James F.	Populations composed entirely of hybrid colonies: bidirectional hybridization and polyandry in harvester ants	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	In eusocial Hymenoptera, haplodiploid life cycles, obligate sterile castes, and polyandry may facilitate selection for hybridization. We analyzed a broad hybrid zone between the ecologically distinct seed-harvester ants Pogonomyrmex occidentalis (Cresson) and Pogonomyrmex maricopa (Wheeler) using mitochondrial (mt)DNA sequence data, eight morphological markers, and 14 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Average mtDNA sequence divergence among parental species was 11.34%, indicating secondary contact. RAPD markers were significantly correlated with morphological variation, confirming the interspecific hybrid origin of all morphologically putative hybrid colonies. A morphological hybrid index indicates an abundance of both F, hybrids and parental morphotypes within colonies. Individual character frequencies plotted against distance show coincident and concordant clines, suggesting little to no introgression. The structure of the hybrid zone is two-fold. Within the western region, stark reversals in character frequencies coincide with overt soil differences, indicating a mosaic hybrid zone structure. The eastern region is a riparian habitat where four adjacent populations were composed entirely of hybrid colonies. These habitat associations suggest that hybrid worker genomes permit dispersal into intermediate environments that select against one or both parental species. The present study suggests that, in addition to retaining reproductive compatibility, ecologically distinct species of ants may generate hybrid colonies maintained by environmental selection.

Bernardini, Federica; Kriezis, Antonios; Galizi, Roberto; Nolan, Tony; Crisanti, Andrea	Introgression of a synthetic sex ratio distortion system from Anopheles gambiae into Anopheles arabiensis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	I-PpoI is a homing endonuclease that has a high cleavage activity and specificity for a conserved sequence within the ribosomal rDNA repeats, located in a single cluster on the Anopheles gambiae X chromosome. This property has been exploited to develop a synthetic sex ratio distortion system in this mosquito species. When I-PpoI is expressed from a transgene during spermatogenesis in mosquitoes, the paternal X chromosome is shredded and only Y chromosome-bearing sperm are viable, resulting in a male-biased sex ratio of >95% in the progeny. These distorter male mosquitoes can efficiently suppress caged wild-type populations, providing a powerful tool for vector control strategies. Given that malaria mosquito vectors belong to a species complex comprising at least two major vectors, we investigated whether the sex distorter I-PpoI, originally integrated in the A. gambiae genome, could be transferred via introgression to the sibling vector species Anopheles arabiensis. In compliance with Haldane's rule, F1 hybrid male sterility is known to occur in all intercrosses among members of the Anopheles gambiae complex. A scheme based on genetic crosses and transgene selection was used to bypass F1 hybrid male sterility and introgress the sex distorter I-PpoI into the A. arabiensis genetic background. Our data suggest that this sex distortion technique can be successfully applied to target A. arabiensis mosquitoes.	2019	10.1038/s41598-019-41646-8		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Chang, Audrey S.; Noor, Mohamed A. F.	The genetics of hybrid male sterility between the allopatric species pair Drosophila persimilis and D-pseudoobscura bogotana: dominant sterility alleles in collinear autosomal regions	GENETICS	F-1 hybrid male sterility is thought to result from interactions between loci on the X chromosome and dominant-acting loci on the autosomes. While X-linked loci that contribute to hybrid male sterility have been precisely localized in many animal taxa, their dominant autosomal interactors have been more difficult to localize precisely and/or have been shown to be of relatively smaller effect. Here, we identified and mapped at least four dominant autosomal factors contributing to hybrid male sterility in the allopatric species pair Drosophila. permilis and A pseudoobscura bogotana. Using these results, we tested predictions of reduced recombination models of speciation. Consistent With these models, three of the four QTL associated with hybrid male sterility occur in collinear (uninverted) regions of these genomes. Furthermore, these QTL do not contribute significantly to hybrid male sterility in crosses between the sympatric species D. persitnilis and A pseudoobscurapseudoobscura. The autosomal loci identified in this study provide the basis for introgression mapping and, ultimately, for molecular cloning of interacting genes that contribute to F-1 hybrid sterility.	2007	10.1534/genetics.106.067314		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	hybrid fitness analysis	FALSE			FALSE	
Civetta, A; Montooth, KL; Mendelson, M	Quantitative trait loci and interaction effects responsible for variation in female postmating mortality in Drosophila simulans and D-sechellia introgression lines	HEREDITY	Mating appears to inflict a cost to Drosophila females, resulting in a reduction of their lifespan shortly after mating. Males from different chromosome extracted lines differ significantly in their detrimental effects on postmating female survival, and seminal fluid proteins produced in the male accessory glands are at least partially responsible for the effect. This suggests that there is a genetic basis underlying the male inflicted effect on female's postmating mortality. However, the genes responsible for this effect remain elusive. Using males from introgression lines between D. simulans and D. sechellia genomes and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach, we identified chromosomal regions that affect postmating mortality of females. We found a second chromosome QTL with an effect on average female lifespan after mating and a third chromosome QTL with an effect on postmating female mortality rate. Under the general observation of a faster divergence of sex-related genes among closely related species, it is predicted that genes for reproductive traits other than hybrid sterility will show evidence of epistatic effects when brought into a hetero-specific background. We detected a significant epistatic genetic effect on postmating female mortality rate that supports this prediction.	2005	10.1038/sj.hdy.6800570		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Identification using the mitochondrial barcoding gene, i.e., the Cytochrome c Oxidase 1, is impossible, as both species share the same highly differentiated haplotypes due to introgression. Nuclear gene markers obtained through double digest restriction site associate sequencing (ddRAD seq), however, can reliably distinguish both species, yet the method is expensive as well as time-consuming and therefore not practicable for species determination. To facilitate accurate species identification without sequencing genome-wide markers, we developed nine diagnostic nuclear RFLP markers based on ddRAD seq data. The markers were successfully tested on geographically distinct populations of the two Sericostoma species in western Germany, on known hybrids, and on another sericostomatid caddisfly species, Oecismus monedula (Hagen, 1859) that sometimes shares the habitat and can be morphologically confounded with Sericostoma. We describe a simple and fast protocol for reliable species identification of S. personatum and S. flavicorne independent of the life cycle stage of the specimens.	2019	10.3897/zookeys.872.34278		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Marker development	FALSE			FALSE

Fine-Scale Mapping of the Nasonia Genome to Chromosomes Using a High-Density Genotyping Microarray	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Nasonia, a genus of four closely related parasitoid insect species, is a model system for genetic research. Their haplodiploid genetics (haploid males and diploid females) and interfertile species are advantageous for the genetic analysis of complex traits and the genetic basis of species differences. A fine-scale genomic map is an important tool for advancing genetic studies in this system. We developed and used a hybrid genotyping microarray to generate a high-resolution genetic map that covers 79% of the sequenced genome of Nasonia vitripennis. The microarray is based on differential hybridization of species-specific oligos between N. vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti at more than 20,000 markers spanning the Nasonia genome. The map places 729 scaffolds onto the five linkage groups of Nasonia, including locating many smaller scaffolds that would be difficult to map by other means. The microarray was used to characterize 26 segmental introgression lines containing chromosomal regions from one species in the genetic background of another. These segmental introgression lines have been used for rapid screening and mapping of quantitative trait loci involved in species differences. Finally, the microarray is extended to bulk-segregant analysis and genotyping of other Nasonia species combinations. These resources should further expand the usefulness of Nasonia for studies of the genetic basis and architecture of complex traits and speciation.	2013	10.1534/g3.112.004739		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Dordevic, Mirko; Savkovic, Uros; Lazarevic, Jelica; Tucic, Nikola; Stojkovic, Biljana	Intergenomic Interactions in Hybrids Between Short-Lived and Long-Lived Lines of a Seed Beetle: Analyses of Life History Traits	EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Products and regulatory motifs of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes interact closely to enable efficient cellular energy production within mitochondria. Although recent evidences support the prediction that during evolutionary time combinations of these interactions are optimized by selection acting on important life history traits, relatively few studies have directly tested it. The goal of this study was to test the role of mitonuclear interactions in shaping preadult and adult life history traits under age-specific selection in the seed beetle (Acanthoscelides obtectus). In order to disentangle the effects of mitochondria, nuclei and their interaction in the evolutionary response to the long-term laboratory selection for early (E) and late (L) reproduction, we used mitonuclear introgression lines in which E and L mitochondrial genomes were expressed in both E and L nuclear background. We found that mitonuclear genotypes carrying disrupted pair of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes mainly affected preadult life history traits-egg-to-adult viability and developmental time. Neither mitochondria nor their interaction with nuclear genomes had effects on realized fecundity of mated females and longevity of virgin beetles. However, when involved in reproductive activities females and males with disrupted genotypes mostly exhibited reduced longevity. Furthermore, since reproduced males exhibited greater longevity cost than females, our results are in accordance with the mother's curse hypothesis. Being that for the most life history traits we detected smaller additive mitochondrial genetic effects compared with epistatic mitonuclear effects, we concluded that mitonuclear interactions might be the target of age-specific selection.	2015	10.1007/s11692-015-9340-9		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Dowling, Damian K.; Abiega, Katia Chavez; Arnqvist, Goran	Temperature-specific outcomes of cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions on egg-to-adult development time in seed beetles	EVOLUTION	The integration of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes coordinates cellular energy production and is fundamental to life among eukaryotes. Therefore, there is potential for strong selection to shape the interactions between the two genomes. Several studies have now demonstrated that epistatic interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes for fitness can occur both at a "within" and "across" population level. Genotype-by-environment interactions are common for traits that are encoded by nuclear genes, but the effects of environmental heterogeneity on traits that are partly encoded by cytoplasmic genes have received little attention despite the fact that there are reasons to believe that phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic genetic variation may often be environment specific. Consequently, the importance of environmental heterogeneity to the outcomes of cyto-nuclear fitness interactions and to the maintenance of mitochondrial polymorphism is unclear. Here, we assess the influence of temperature on cyto-nuclear effects on egg-to-adult development time in seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus). We employed an "across-population" design, sourcing beetles from five distinct populations and using backcrossing to create orthogonal combinations of distinct introgression lines, fixed for their cytoplasmic and nuclear lineages. We then assayed development times at two different temperatures and found sizeable cyto-nuclear effects in general, as well as temperature- and block-specific cyto-nuclear effects. These results demonstrate that environmental factors such as temperature do exert selection on cytoplasmic genes by favoring specific cyto-nuclear genetic combinations, and are consistent with the suggestion that complex genotype-by-environment interactions may promote the maintenance of polymorphism in mitochondrial genes.	2007	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00016.x		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Rapid spread of male-killing Wolbachia in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Reproductive parasites such as Wolbachia can spread through uninfected host populations by increasing the relative fitness of the infected maternal lineage. However, empirical estimates of how fast this process occurs are limited. Here we use nucleotide sequences of male-killing Wolbachia bacteria and co-inherited mitochondria to address this issue in the island butterfly Hypolimnas bolina. We show that infected specimens scattered throughout the species range harbour the same Wolbachia and mitochondrial DNA as inferred from 6337 bp of the bacterial genome and 2985 bp of the mitochondrial genome, suggesting this strain of Wolbachia has spread across the South Pacific Islands at most 3000 years ago, and probably much more recently.	2010	10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01891.x		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Fang, Shu; Yukilevich, Roman; Chen, Ying; Turissini, David A.; Zeng, Kai; Boussy, Ian A.; Wu, Chung-I.	Incompatibility and Competitive Exclusion of Genomic Segments between Sibling Drosophila Species	PLOS GENETICS	The extent and nature of genetic incompatibilities between incipient races and sibling species is of fundamental importance to our view of speciation. However, with the exception of hybrid inviability and sterility factors, little is known about the extent of other, more subtle genetic incompatibilities between incipient species. Here we experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of such genetic incompatibilities between two young allopatric sibling species, Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia. Our experiments took advantage of 12 introgression lines that carried random introgressed D. sechellia segments in different parts of the D. simulans genome. First, we found that these introgression lines did not show any measurable sterility or inviability effects. To study if these sechellia introgressions in a simulans background contained other fitness consequences, we competed and genetically tracked the marked alleles within each introgression against the wild-type alleles for 20 generations. Strikingly, all marked D. sechellia introgression alleles rapidly decreased in frequency in only 6 to 7 generations. We then developed computer simulations to model our competition results. These simulations indicated that selection against D. sechellia introgression alleles was high (average s = 0.43) and that the marker alleles and the incompatible alleles did not separate in 78% of the introgressions. The latter result likely implies that most introgressions contain multiple genetic incompatibilities. Thus, this study reveals that, even at early stages of speciation, many parts of the genome diverge to a point where introducing foreign elements has detrimental fitness consequences, but which cannot be seen using standard sterility and inviability assays.	2012	10.1371/journal.pgen.1002795		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ferguson, Jennifer; Gomes, Suzanne; Civetta, Alberto	Rapid Male-Specific Regulatory Divergence and Down Regulation of Spermatogenesis Genes in Drosophila Species Hybrids	PLOS ONE	In most crosses between closely related species of Drosophila, the male hybrids are sterile and show postmeiotic abnormalities. A series of gene expression studies using genomic approaches have found significant down regulation of postmeiotic spermatogenesis genes in sterile male hybrids. These results have led some to suggest a direct relationship between down regulation in gene expression and hybrid sterility. An alternative explanation to a cause-and-effect relationship between misregulation of gene expression and male sterility is rapid divergence of male sex regulatory elements leading to incompatible interactions in an interspecies hybrid genome. To test the effect of regulatory divergence in spermatogenesis gene expression, we isolated 35 fertile D. simulans strains with D. mauritiana introgressions in either the X, second or third chromosome. We analyzed gene expression in these fertile hybrid strains for a subset of spermatogenesis genes previously reported as significantly under expressed in sterile hybrids relative to D. simulans. We found that fertile autosomal introgressions can cause levels of gene down regulation similar to that of sterile hybrids. We also found that X chromosome heterospecific introgressions cause significantly less gene down regulation than autosomal introgressions. Our results provide evidence that rapid male sex gene regulatory divergence can explain misexpression of spermatogenesis genes in hybrids.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0061575		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Fontdevila, Antonio	Hybrid Genome Evolution by Transposition: An Update	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	Contrary to the view that hybrids are lineages devoid of evolutionary value, a number of case studies that have been lately reported show how hybrids are at the origin of many species. Some well-documented cases demonstrate that bursts of transposition often follow hybridization, generating new genetic variability. Studies in hybrid transposition strongly suggest that epigenetic changes and divergence in piRNA pathways drive deregulation in TE landscapes. Here, I have focused on mechanisms acting in Drosophila hybrids between two cactophilic species. The results reported here show that while hybrid instability by transposition is a genome-wide event, deregulation by TE overexpression in hybrid ovaries is not a general rule. When piRNA pools of ovaries are studied, results show that TEs with parental differences higher than 2-fold in their piRNA amounts are not more commonly deregulated in hybrids than TEs with similar levels, partially discrediting the generality of the maternal cytotype hypothesis. Some promising results on the piRNA pathway global failure hypothesis, which states that accumulated divergence of piRNA effector proteins is responsible for hybrid TE deregulation, have also been obtained. Altogether, these results suggest that TE deregulation might be driven by several interacting mechanisms. A natural scenario is proposed in which genome instability by transposition leads to hybrid genome reorganization. Small hybrid populations, subjected to natural selection helped by genetic drift, evolve new adaptations adapted to novel environments. The final step is either introgression or even a new hybrid species.	2019	10.1093/jhered/esy040		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Forbes, Andrew A.; Kelly, Patrick H.; Middleton, Kara A.; Condon, Marty A.	Genetically differentiated races and speciation-with-gene-flow in the sunflower maggot, Strauzia longipennis	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY	The ecological interactions parasitic insects have with their hosts may contribute to their prodigious diversity, which is unrivaled among animals. Many insects assumed to be polyphagous generalists have been shown to consist of several differentiated races, each occupying a different host-niche. The sunflower maggot fly, Strauzia longipennis, has long been thought to consist of two or more races due to its substantial intra-specific morphological variation. Here, we use nuclear and mitochondrial markers to test the hypothesis that S. longipennis is a complex of two or more partially reproductively isolated races. We collected S. longipennis flies as pupae from roots of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and as adults swept from leaves of mature H. tuberosus across the breadth of a field season. Flies were scored for morphological variety (typica or vittigera), mitochondrial haplotype (A or B) and a panel of 176 AFLP loci. Bayesian clustering and neighbor-joining phylogenetic analyses of AFLP data supported the existence of at least three, possibly four, genetic races of Strauzia (clusters I, II, III, and V), as well as a small number of putative interracial hybrids (cluster IV). Clusters I and III each consisted of flies of both morphological varieties and both haplotype groups, while flies in cluster II were all of variety typica and all but one was of mitochondrial haplotype B. Flies in cluster II were also collected only as adults on H. tuberosus and not among flies reared from pupae collected from H. tuberosus roots, suggesting that they use a different plant as their larval host. Mean capture date was significantly different between flies of each genetic race, indicating that partial allochronic isolation may be one contemporary barrier to gene flow between races. Evidence that mitochondrial genomes and morphological traits have moved between lineages implies a model of speciation-with-gene-flow for S. longipennis races.	2013	10.1007/s10682-012-9622-y		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Go, Alwyn; Alhazmi, Doaa; Civetta, Alberto	Altered expression of cell adhesion genes and hybrid male sterility between subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura	GENOME	Drosophila pseudoobscura pseudoobscura and Drosophila pseudoobscura bogotana are two closely related subspecies with incomplete reproductive isolation. A genome-wide comparison of expression in hybrids relative to parental subspecies has been previously used to identify genes with significant changes in expression uniquely associated with the sterile condition. The misexpression (i.e., gene expression beyond levels found in parentals) of such genes could be directly linked to the onset of sterility or could alternatively be caused by incompatibilities in a hybrid genome without a direct link to sterility. Cell adhesion was previously found to be one of the largest gene ontologies with changes in expression linked to sterility. Here we used gene expression assays in fertile backcross male progeny, along with introgression progeny in which we swap a major hybrid male sterility (HMS) allele, to generate fertile and sterile males genotypically similar to F-1 sterile hybrids. We identify a cell adhesion gene (GA10921) whose change in expression is directly linked to sterility and modulated by a previously characterized HMS protein. GA10921 adds to our rather limited knowledge of changes in gene expression associated with HMS, and to the identification of gene interacting partners linked to HMS.	2019	10.1139/gen-2019-0066		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Hahn, Matthew W.; White, Bradley J.; Muir, Christopher D.; Besansky, Nora J.	No evidence for biased co-transmission of speciation islands in Anopheles gambiae	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Genome-scale scans have revealed highly heterogeneous levels of divergence between closely related taxa in many systems. Generally, a small number of regions show high differentiation, with the rest of the genome showing no or only low levels of divergence. These patterns have been interpreted as evidence for ongoing speciation-with-gene-flow, with introgression homogenizing the whole genome except loci involved in reproductive isolation. However, as the number of selected loci increases, the probability of introgression at unselected loci decreases unless there is a transmission ratio distortion causing an over-representation of specific combinations of alleles. Here we examine the transmission of three 'speciation islands' that contain fixed differences between the M and S forms of the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. We made reciprocal crosses between M and S parents and genotyped over 2000 F-2 individuals, developing a hierarchical likelihood model to identify specific genotypes that are under- or over-represented among the recombinant offspring. Though our overall results did not match the expected number of F-2 genotypes, we found no biased co-transmission among M or S alleles in the three islands. Our likelihood model did identify transmission ratio distortion at two of the three islands, but this distortion was small (approx. 3%) and in opposite directions for the two islands. We discuss how our results impinge on hypotheses of current gene flow between M and S and ongoing speciation-with-gene-flow in this system.	2012	10.1098/rstb.2011.0188		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Kulathinal, Rob J.; Stevison, Laurie S.; Noor, Mohamed A. F.	The Genomics of Speciation in Drosophila: Diversity, Divergence, and Introgression Estimated Using Low-Coverage Genome Sequencing	PLOS GENETICS	In nature, closely related species may hybridize while still retaining their distinctive identities. Chromosomal regions that experience reduced recombination in hybrids, such as within inversions, have been hypothesized to contribute to the maintenance of species integrity. Here, we examine genomic sequences from closely related fruit fly taxa of the Drosophila pseudoobscura subgroup to reconstruct their evolutionary histories and past patterns of genic exchange. Partial genomic assemblies were generated from two subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura (D. ps.) and an outgroup species, D. miranda. These new assemblies were compared to available assemblies of D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, two species with overlapping ranges in western North America. Within inverted regions, nucleotide divergence among each pair of the three species is comparable, whereas divergence between D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis in non-inverted regions is much lower and closer to levels of intraspecific variation. Using molecular markers flanking each of the major chromosomal inversions, we identify strong crossover suppression in F(1) hybrids extending over 2 megabase pairs (Mbp) beyond the inversion breakpoints. These regions of crossover suppression also exhibit the high nucleotide divergence associated with inverted regions. Finally, by comparison to a geographically isolated subspecies, D. ps. bogotana, our results suggest that autosomal gene exchange between the North American species, D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, occurred since the split of the subspecies, likely within the last 200,000 years. We conclude that chromosomal rearrangements have been vital to the ongoing persistence of these species despite recent hybridization. Our study serves as a proof-of-principle on how whole genome sequencing can be applied to formulate and test hypotheses about species formation in lesser-known non-model systems.	2009	10.1371/journal.pgen.1000550		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Lee, Kyung Min; Kivela, Sami M.; Ivanov, Vladislav; Hausmann, Axel; Kaila, Lauri; Wahlberg, Niklas; Mutanen, Marko	Information Dropout Patterns in Restriction Site Associated DNA Phylogenomics and a Comparison with Multilocus Sanger Data in a Species-Rich Moth Genus	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	A rapid shift from traditional Sanger sequencing-based molecular methods to the phylogenomic approach with large numbers of loci is underway. Among phylogenomic methods, restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing approaches have gained much attention as they enable rapid generation of up to thousands of loci randomly scattered across the genome and are suitable for nonmodel species. RAD data sets however suffer from large amounts of missing data and rapid locus dropout along with decreasing relatedness among taxa. The relationship between locus dropout and the amount of phylogenetic information retained in the data has remained largely uninvestigated. Similarly, phylogenetic hypotheses based on RAD have rarely been compared with phylogenetic hypotheses based on multilocus Sanger sequencing, even less so using exactly the same species and specimens. We compared the Sanger-based phylogenetic hypothesis (8 loci; 6172 bp) of 32 species of the diverse moth genus Eupithecia (Lepidoptera, Geometridae) to that based on double-digest RAD sequencing (3256 loci; 726,658 bp). We observed that topologies were largely congruent, with some notable exceptions that we discuss. The locus dropout effect was strong. We demonstrate that number of loci is not a precise measure of phylogenetic information since the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may remain low at very shallow phylogenetic levels despite large numbers of loci. As we hypothesize, the number of SNPs and parsimony informative SNPs (PIS) is low at shallow phylogenetic levels, peaks at intermediate levels and, thereafter, declines again at the deepest levels as a result of decay of available loci. Similarly, we demonstrate with empirical data that the locus dropout affects the type of loci retained, the loci found in many species tending to show lower interspecific distances than those shared among fewer species. We also examine the effects of the numbers of loci, SNPs, and PIS on nodal bootstrap support, but could not demonstrate with our data our expectation of a positive correlation between them. We conclude that RAD methods provide a powerful tool for phylogenomics at an intermediate phylogenetic level as indicated by its broad congruence with an eight-gene Sanger data set in a genus of moths. When assessing the quality of the data for phylogenetic inference, the focus should be on the distribution and number of SNPs and PIS rather than on loci.	2018	10.1093/sysbio/syy029		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	no D or fd stats	FALSE			FALSE	
Ma, Daina; Michalak, Pawel	Ephemeral Association Between Gene CG5762 and Hybrid Male Sterility in Drosophila Sibling Species	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION	Interspecies divergence in regulatory pathways may result in hybrid male sterility (HMS) when dominance and epistatic interactions between alleles that are functional within one genome are disrupted in hybrid genomes. The identification of genes contributing to HMS and other hybrid dysfunctions is essential for understanding the origin of new species (speciation). Previously, we identified a panel of male-specific loci misexpressed in sterile male hybrids of Drosophila simulans and D. mauritiana relative to parental species. In the current work, we attempt to dissect the genetic associations between HMS and one of the genes, CG5762, a Drosophila-unique locus characterized by rapid sequence divergence within the genus, presumably driven by positive natural selection. CG5762 is underexpressed in sterile backcross males compared with their fertile brothers. In CG5762 heterozygotes, the D. mauritiana allele is consistently overexpressed on both the D. simulans and D. mauritiana backcross genomic background, suggesting a cis-acting regulation factor. There is a significant association between heterozygosity and HMS in hybrid males from early but not later backcross generations. Microsatellite markers spanning CG5762 fail to associate with HMS. These observations lead to a conclusion that CG5762 is not a causative factor of HMS. Although genetic linkage between CG5762 and a neighboring causative introgression cannot be ruled out, it seems that the pattern is most consistent with CG5762 participating in epistatic interactions that are disrupted in flies with HMS.	2011	10.1007/s00239-011-9466-z		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Mardiros, Xian B.; Park, Ronni; Clifton, Bryan; Grewal, Gurman; Khizar, Amina K.; Markow, Therese A.; Ranz, Jose M.; Civetta, Alberto	Postmating Reproductive isolation between strains of Drosophila willistoni	FLY	Speciation can occur through the presence of reproductive isolation barriers that impede mating, restrict cross-fertilization, or render inviable/sterile hybrid progeny. The D. willistoni subgroup is ideally suited for studies of speciation, with examples of both allopatry and sympatry, a range of isolation barriers, and the availability of one species complete genome sequence to facilitate genetic studies of divergence. D. w. willistoni has the largest geographic distribution among members of the Drosophila willistoni subgroup, spanning from Argentina to the southern United States, including the Caribbean islands. A subspecies of D. w. willistoni, D. w. quechua, is geographically separated by the Andes mountain range and has evolved unidirectional sterility, in that only male offspring of D. w. quechua females x D. w. willistoni males are sterile. Whether D. w. willistoni flies residing east of the Andes belong to one or more D. willistoni subspecies remains unresolved. Here we perform fecundity assays and show that F1 hybrid males produced from crosses between different strains found in Central America, North America, and northern Caribbean islands are reproductively isolated from South American and southern Caribbean island strains as a result of unidirectional hybrid male sterility. Our results show the existence of a reproductive isolation barrier between the northern and southern strains and suggest a subdivision of the previously identified D. willistoni willistoni species into 2 new subspecies.	2016	10.1080/19336934.2016.1197448		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Maroja, Luana S.; Larson, Erica L.; Bogdanowicz, Steven M.; Harrison, Richard G.	Genes with Restricted Introgression in a Field Cricket (Gryllus firmus/Gryllus pennsylvanicus) Hybrid Zone Are Concentrated on the X Chromosome and a Single Autosome	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Characterizing the extent of genomic differentiation between recently diverged lineages provides an important context for understanding the early stages of speciation. When such lineages form discrete hybrid zones, patterns of differential introgression allow direct estimates of which genome regions are likely involved in speciation and local adaptation. Here we use a backcross experimental design to construct a genetic linkage map for the field crickets Gryllus firmus and Gryllus pennsylvanicus, which interact in a well-characterized hybrid zone in eastern North America. We demonstrate that loci with major allele frequency differences between allopatric populations are not randomly distributed across the genome. Instead, most are either X-linked or map to a few small autosomal regions. Furthermore, the subset of those highly differentiated markers that exhibit restricted introgression across the cricket hybrid zone are also concentrated on the X chromosome (39 of 50 loci) and in a single 7-cM region of one autosome. Although the accumulation on the sex chromosome of genes responsible for postzygotic barriers is a well-known phenomenon, less attention has been given to the genomic distribution of genes responsible for prezygotic barriers. We discuss the implications of our results for speciation, both in the context of the role of sex chromosomes and also with respect to the likely causes of heterogeneous genomic divergence. Although we do not yet have direct evidence for the accumulation of ecological, behavioral, or fertilization prezygotic barrier genes on the X chromosome, faster-X evolution could make these barriers more likely to be X-linked.	2015	10.1534/g3.115.021246		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Rapid and Predictable Evolution of Admixed Populations Between Two Drosophila Species Pairs	GENETICS	The consequences of hybridization are varied, ranging from the origin of new lineages, introgression of some genes between species, to the extinction of one of the hybridizing species. We generated replicate admixed populations between two pairs of sister species of Drosophila: D. simulans and D. mauritiana; and D. yakuba and D. santomea. Each pair consisted of a continental species and an island endemic. The admixed populations were maintained by random mating in discrete generations for over 20 generations. We assessed morphological, behavioral, and fitness-related traits from each replicate population periodically, and sequenced genomic DNA from the populations at generation 20. For both pairs of species, species-specific traits and their genomes regressed to those of the continental species. A few alleles from the island species persisted, but they tended to be proportionally rare among all sites in the genome and were rarely fixed within the populations. This paucity of alleles from the island species was particularly pronounced on the X-chromosome. These results indicate that nearly all foreign genes were quickly eliminated after hybridization and that selection against the minor species genome might be similar across experimental replicates.	2020	10.1534/genetics.119.302685		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	experimental swarms	FALSE			FALSE	
Meiklejohn, Colin D.; Coolon, Joseph D.; Hartl, Daniel L.; Wittkopp, Patricia J.	The roles of cis- and trans- regulation in the evolution of regulatory incompatibilities and sexually dimorphic gene expression	GENOME RESEARCH	Evolutionary changes in gene expression underlie many aspects of phenotypic diversity within and among species. Understanding the genetic basis for evolved changes in gene expression is therefore an important component of a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution. Using interspecific introgression hybrids, we examined the genetic basis for divergence in genome-wide patterns of gene expression between Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana. We find that cis-regulatory and trans-regulatory divergences differ significantly in patterns of genetic architecture and evolution. The effects of cis-regulatory divergence are approximately additive in heterozygotes, quantitatively different between males and females, and well predicted by expression differences between the two parental species. In contrast, the effects of trans-regulatory divergence are associated with largely dominant introgressed alleles, have similar effects in the two sexes, and generate expression levels in hybrids outside the range of expression in both parental species. Although the effects of introgressed trans-regulatory alleles are similar in males and females, expression levels of the genes they regulate are sexually dimorphic between the parental D. simulans and D. mauritiana strains, suggesting that pure-species genotypes carry unlinked modifier alleles that increase sexual dimorphism in expression. Our results suggest that independent effects of cis-regulatory substitutions in males and females may favor their role in the evolution of sexually dimorphic phenotypes, and that trans-regulatory divergence is an important source of regulatory incompatibilities.	2014	10.1101/gr.156414.113		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Mercader, R. J.; Aardema, M. L.; Scriber, J. M.	Hybridization leads to host-use divergence in a polyphagous butterfly sibling species pair	OECOLOGIA	Climate warming has lead to increased genetic introgression across a narrow hybrid zone separating the eastern and Canadian tiger swallowtails (Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis). This situation has led to the formation of an allochronically separated hybrid population with a delayed emerging phenotype or "late flight''. Here, we assess how the recombination of the parental genomes that lead to this phenotype may have facilitated another major ecological shift, host-use divergence. We first contrast the ovipositional profiles of the late flight population to that of the parental species P. glaucus and P. canadensis. Subsequently we contrast the larval survival and growth of the late flight, a P. canadensis and a P. glaucus population, and a population from the northern edge of the hybrid zone on five hosts. Our results indicate that the ovipositional preference of this hybrid swarm is identical to that of the introgressing parental species, P. glaucus. Due to the absence of the preferred hosts of P. glaucus (Liriodendron tulipifera L. and Ptelea trifoliata L.) where the late flight occurs, this ovipositional pattern implies a functional specialization onto a secondary host of both parental species, Fraxinus americana L. In contrast, the larval host-use abilities represent a mixture of P. glaucus and P. canadensis, indicating divergence in larval host-use abilities has not taken place. However, high genetic variability (genetic coefficient of variation) is present for growth on F. americana in the late flight hybrid swarm and tradeoffs for larval performance on the preferred hosts of the parental species are evident; indicating a strong potential for future specialization in larval host-use abilities. This current scenario represents an instance where a shift in a major ecological trait, host use, is likely occurring as a byproduct of a shift in an unrelated trait (delayed emergence) leading to partial reproductive isolation.	2009	10.1007/s00442-008-1177-9		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	didn't actually calculate introgression statistics	FALSE			FALSE	
Ostroverkhova, Nadezhda, V; Rosseykina, Svetlana A.; Konusova, Olga L.; Kucher, Aksana N.; Kireeva, Tatyana N.	Diversity of the honeybee Apis mellifera L. in Tomsk region according to morphometric and molecular genetic markers	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA	In Siberia, the honeybee was introduced about 230 years ago. It was the dark-colored forest bee Apis mellifera mellifera L., that was cultivated in Siberia as the most adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. At the end of the last century, bees of the southern breeds, mainly Apis mellifera carpathica subspecies (a derivative of A. m. carnica subspecies), were actively imported to Siberia. Introgressive bee hybridization leads to the reduction of the range of native subspecies and the formation of hybrids, modifies the genetic pool of local honeybee populations leading to the loss of their genetic identity. Russia, including Siberia, still has unique abilities to preserve the aboriginal populations of the honeybee. For Siberia, such a unique subspecies is the dark-colored forest bee A. m. mellifera, which is considered endangered in Europe. At present, the knowledge of honeybee subspecies living in Siberia, including Tomsk region, is insufficient; data on the genetic diversity of honeybees are fragmentary. In this regard, the aim of this work was to identify the biological diversity of the A. mellifera honeybee living in Tomsk region using morphometric and molecular genetic markers. A total of 337 bee colonies obtained from 65 apiaries of Tomsk region were investigated using mtDNA analysis (variability of the COI-COII locus) and morphometric method (analysis of wing parameters: cubital and hantel indexes, discoidal shift) (See Fig. 1). The genetic diversity of honeybees was studied using 9 microsatellite loci (A008, AC117, A043, A113, A024, Ap243, Ap049, H110, SV185), a total of 106 bee colonies and 893 individuals were investigated. According to the analysis of variability of the COI-COII mtDNA locus, 62.9% of bee colonies were of A. m. mellifera origin on maternal line, 29.1% of bee colonies were of the origin from the southern subspecies and 8.0% were from mixed colonies. Three variants of the mtDNA COI-COII locus were registered: PQQ, PQQQ (characteristic of A. m. mellifera) and Q (characteristic of subspecies of the southern origin) (See Fig. 2). According to a morphometric study, about 56% of the studied bee colonies conformed to the A. m. mellifera standard according to the majority of morphometric parameters, but for some individual characteristics (mainly the indicator "discoidal shift"), a deviation from the values adopted for this subspecies was recorded. About 24% of the studied bee colonies are more consistent with the A. m. carpathica standard, but also have some signs characteristic of A. m. mellifera (hybrids based on the A. m. carpatica subspecies). Finally, a comparative analysis of the variability of morphometric parameters and variability of the COI-COII mtDNA locus allowed us to identify bee colonies (the so-called "inverted colonies"), which corresponded to the A. m. mellifera standard according to morphometric parameters, but had the Q variant of mtDNA (colony origin from the southern bee subspecies on the maternal line) or, on the contrary, the colonies were the A. m. carpathica subspecies according to morphometric parameters, while mtDNA was specific for A. m. mellifera (See Table 1). Consequently, the study of honeybees in Tomsk region using a comprehensive approach, including morphometric and mtDNA analysis, showed that most bee colonies are represented by hybrid forms both on the basis of A. m. mellifera subspecies and on the basis of A. m. carpathica, hybrids based on A. m. mellifera prevail (See Fig. 3). No large areas were found with a genetically homogeneous array of bees, originating from A. m. mellifera subspecies. At the same time, the apiaries, where A. m. mellifera bees are preserved and bred, were identified in some districts of Tomsk region (Molchanovsky, Chainsky, Zyryansky, Teguldetsky, Tomsky) (See Fig. 3). In order to characterize the genetic diversity of honeybees in Tomsk region, as well as to assess the process of bee hybridization, we analyzed the variability of nine microsatellite loci in honeybees (See Table 2). A comparative analysis of the variability of the studied microsatellite loci in purebred bees (A. m. mellifera and A. m. carpathica) showed differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of alleles between subspecies for most loci. In addition, for some loci (A008, A043, A113, A024, and Ap049), the predominant alleles were recorded (the frequency of their registration was more than 0.40), and the spectrum of these alleles differed in bees of different evolutionary lineages (M and C) (See Table 2). Evaluation of genetic diversity on heterozygosity of most of the studied loci revealed similar results for two bee subspecies, namely lower values of the observed heterozygosity compared with the expected heterozygosity (See Table 2). The revealed differences between honeybees of A. m. mellifera and A. m. carpathica subspecies on the variability of the studied loci were used to assess the genetic diversity of hybrid bees obtained from apiaries of Tomsk region. We have established that both in hybrids based on A. m. mellifera subspecies (variants PQQ and PQQQ of the COI-COII mtDNA locus) and in hybrids based on subspecies of the southern origin (variant Q of the COI-COII locus) the nuclear genome is more consistent with the A. m. mellifera genome in the spectrum and/or frequency of alleles of the studied DNA markers. Using the Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) method (See Fig. 4 and 5), we showed that the genetic diversity of honeybees living in apiaries of Tomsk region is not determined by a single indicator (geographical localization and isolation of apiaries, the bee breed (origin), the level of gene introgression), but by the complex effect of the above factors, whose importance to a certain extent depends on human activity. Thus, the study of genetic diversity, which is determined by numerous factors, as well as evaluation of the level of introgression between aboriginal and adventive subspecies of honey bees are important to establish the effects of hybridization and to preserve the gene pool of local bee subspecies. To preserve and restore the unique gene pool of A. m. mellifera, a Coordinating Council on the problems of selection, rational use and protection of A. m. mellifera gene pool was created in 2019 in Russia. Two researchers from "Apis" Scientific and Production Center, Tomsk State University are its members. The success of measures to preserve aboriginal bee ecotypes will primarily depend on detecting and restoring the unique surviving populations, creating bee nurseries and reserves, as well as on studying the current state of various honeybee populations to understand genetic processess going on in them.	2019	10.17223/19988591/47/8		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Bulletin	FALSE			FALSE	
Pritchard, Victoria L.; Edmands, Suzanne	THE GENOMIC TRAJECTORY OF HYBRID SWARMS: OUTCOMES OF REPEATED CROSSES BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF TIGRIOPUS CALIFORNICUS	EVOLUTION	Introgressive hybridization between genetically divergent populations is an important evolutionary process. The degree to which repeated hybridization events between the same parental taxa lead to similar genomic outcomes is unknown. This study addressed this question by following genomic trajectories of replicate hybrid swarms of the copepod Tigriopus californicus over many generations of free mating. Swarm composition was determined both by differential reproductive success of founder individuals and subsequent selection on hybrid genotypes. For one cross, between two populations showing differential fitness in the laboratory and no hybrid breakdown, the genetic trajectory was highly repeatable: replicates rapidly became dominated by alleles from the fitter parent. In a second cross, between two populations showing similar fitness and significant F2 hybrid breakdown, alleles from alternative populations dominated different replicates. Swarms exhibited a general temporal trend of decreasing cytonuclear mismatch. Some patterns of differential introgression across the genome were strikingly congruent amongst swarm replicates, both within and between cross types, and reflected patterns of segregation distortion previously observed within controlled crosses between the same parental populations. Differences in heterozygosity between the sexes, and evidence for a previously suspected sex-distortion locus, suggest that complex interactions between sex and genotype influence hybrid swarm outcome.	2013	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01814.x		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Romero-Soriano, Valeria; Burlet, Nelly; Vela, Doris; Fontdevila, Antonio; Vieira, Cristina; Garcia Guerreiro, Maria Pilar	Drosophila Females Undergo Genome Expansion after Interspecific Hybridization	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Genome size (or C-value) can present a wide range of values among eukaryotes. This variation has been attributed to differences in the amplification and deletion of different noncoding repetitive sequences, particularly transposable elements (TEs). TEs can be activated under different stress conditions such as interspecific hybridization events, as described for several species of animals and plants. These massive transposition episodes can lead to considerable genome expansions that could ultimately be involved in hybrid speciation processes. Here, we describe the effects of hybridization and introgression on genome size of Drosophila hybrids. We measured the genome size of two close Drosophila species, Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila koepferae, their F-1 offspring and the offspring from three generations of backcrossed hybrids; where mobilization of up to 28 different TEs was previously detected. We show that hybrid females indeed present a genome expansion, especially in the first backcross, which could likely be explained by transposition events. Hybrid males, which exhibit more variable C-values among individuals of the same generation, do not present an increased genome size. Thus, we demonstrate that the impact of hybridization on genome size can be detected through flow cytometry and is sex-dependent.	2016	10.1093/gbe/evw024		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Sackton, Timothy B.; Montenegro, Horacio; Hartl, Daniel L.; Lemos, Bernardo	Interspecific Y chromosome introgressions disrupt testis-specific gene expression and male reproductive phenotypes in Drosophila	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	The Drosophila Y chromosome is a degenerated, heterochromatic chromosome with few functional genes. Nonetheless, natural variation on the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. However, the contribution of Y chromosome divergence to gene expression divergence between species is unknown. In this study, we constructed a series of Y chromosome introgression lines, in which Y chromosomes from either Drosophila sechellia or Drosophila simulans are introgressed into a common D. simulans genetic background. Using these lines, we compared genome-wide gene expression and male reproductive phenotypes between heterospecific and conspecific Y chromosomes. We find significant differences in expression for 122 genes, or 2.84% of all genes analyzed. Genes down-regulated in males with heterospecific Y chromosomes are significantly biased toward testis-specific expression patterns. These same lines show reduced fecundity and sperm competitive ability. Taken together, these results imply a significant role for Y/X and Y/autosome interactions in maintaining proper expression of male-specific genes, either directly or via indirect effects on male reproductive tissue development or function.	2011	10.1073/pnas.1114690108		Insects			TRUE	FALSE	Crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Sanchez-Guillen, RA; Van Gossum, H; Rivera, AC	Hybridization and the inheritance of female colour polymorphism in two ischnurid damselflies (Odonata : Coenagrionidae)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Female-limited polychromatism is frequent in many species of Odonata. Ischnura elegans has three colour morphs: one male-like coloured (androchrome) and two additional gynochrome brown morphs (infuscans and rufescens-obsoleta morphs). A total of 19 progenies obtained from once-mated females were reared in the laboratory in three generations. Results indicate that the colour morphs are controlled by the same genetic system as previously described for I. graellsii, i.e. an autosomal locus with female-limited expression and with three alleles with a hierarchy of dominance (p(a) > p(i) > p(o)). Five interspecific crossings between female L graellsii and male I. elegans, five crossings between hybrid females and male L elegans and one crossing between female L graellsii and a hybrid male further confirmed that the genetic system is the same in both species. A survey of morph frequencies in north-west Spain revealed that L elegans shows high variability in androchrome frequency (4-91%) between nearby populations, whereas in I. graellsii androchromes never are the majority morph (5-40%). The highest androchrome frequency in I. graellsii was found in populations closest to a locality where both species have hybridized, and that now has the highest androchrome frequency of I. elegans. We hypothesize that I. elegans genes have been incorporated into the genome of I. graellsii resulting in increased androchrome frequency in the latter species. Low androchrome frequency in I. elegans seems also related to the influence of I. graellsii genes. Therefore, we suggest that hybridization between both taxa is contributing to the temporal maintenance of contrasting androchrome frequencies in nearby populations.

Sanogo, Y. O.; Dobson, S. L.; Bordenstein, S. R.; Novak, R. J.	Disruption of the Wolbachia surface protein gene wspB by a transposable element in mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex (Diptera, Culicidae)	INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY	Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say and Culex pipiens pipiens Linnaeus are sibling species incriminated as important vectors of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases worldwide. The two forms differ little morphologically and are differentiated mainly based upon ecological, behavioural, physiological and genetic traits. Within the North American zone of sympatry, populations of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. pipiens undergo extensive introgression and hybrid forms have been reported in nature. Both Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. pipiens are infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. Here, we report the presence of a transposable element belonging to the IS256 family (IS256wPip) associated with Wolbachia in both Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. pipiens populations. Using reverse transcriptase PCR and sequence analysis, we show that IS256wPip has disrupted the wspB locus, a paralogue of the Wolbachia outer membrane protein (wspA) gene. The inactivation of the wspB appears to be specific to Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and to hybrids of the two forms, and was not observed in the surveyed Cx. p. pipiens mosquitoes. Our results support the hypothesis of a different origin of North American Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and Cx. p. pipiens populations. The flux of mobile genetic elements in the Wolbachia wPip genome could explain the high level of crossing types observed among different Culex populations. The insertion of IS256wPip into wspB may comprise a genetic candidate for discriminating Wolbachia symbionts in Culex.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00707.x		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Didn't test for introgression 	FALSE			FALSE	
Sawamura, Kyoichi; Tomimura, Yoshihiko; Sato, Hajime; Yamada, Hirokazu; Matsuda, Muneo; Oguma, Yuzuru	Establishing interspecific mosaic genome lines between Drosophila ananassae and Drosophila pallidosa by means of parthenogenesis	GENETICS RESEARCH	Strong sexual isolation exists between the closely related species Drosophila. ananassae and D. pallidosa, but there is no obvious post-mating isolation; both sexes of the hybrids and their descendants appear to be completely viable and fertile. Strains exhibiting parthenogenesis have been derived from wild populations of both species. We intercrossed such strains and established iso-female lines after the second generation of parthenogenesis. These lines are clones, carrying homozygous chromosomes that are interspecific recombinants. We established 266 such isogenic lines and determined their genetic constitution by using chromosomal and molecular markers. Strong pseudo-linkage was seen between loci on the left arm of chromosome 2 and on the right arm of chromosome 3: the frequency of inheriting the two chromosome regions from the same species was significantly larger than expected. One possible cause of pseudo-linkage is female meiotic bias, so that chromosomes of the same species origin tend to be distributed to the same gamete. But this possibility is ruled out; backcross analysis indicated that the two chromosome regions segregated independently in female hybrids. The remaining possibility is elimination of low-fitness flies carrying, the two chromosome regions from different species. Thus, genetic incompatibility was detected in the species pair for which no hybrid breakdown had previously been indicated. The interspecific mosaic genome' lines reported here will be useful for future research to identify genes involved in speciation and phenotypic evolution.	2006	10.1017/S0016672306008299		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Scriber, J. Mark	Impacts of climate warming on hybrid zone movement: Geographically diffuse and biologically porous "species borders"	INSECT SCIENCE	The ecology and evolutionary biology of insect-plant associations has realized extensive attention, especially during the past 60 years. The classifications (categorical designations) of continuous variation in biodiversity, ranging from global patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradients in species richness/diversity and degree of herbivore feeding specialization) to localized insect-plant associations that span the biospectrum from polyphenisms, polymorphisms, biotypes, demes, host races, to cryptic species, remain academically contentious. Semantic and biosystematic (taxonomical) disagreements sometimes detract from more important ecological and evolutionary processes that drive diversification, the dynamics of gene flow and local extinctions. This review addresses several aspects of insect specialization, host-associated divergence and ecological (including "hybrid") speciation, with special reference to the climate warming impacts on species borders of hybridizing swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). Interspecific hybrid introgression may result in collapse of multi-species communities or increase species numbers via homoploid hybrid speciation. We may see diverging, merging, or emerging genotypes across hybrid zones, all part of the ongoing processes of evolution. Molecular analyses of genetic mosaics and genomic dynamics with "divergence hitchhiking", combined with ecological, ethological and physiological studies of "species porosity", have already begun to unveil some answers for some important ecological/evolutionary questions. (i) How rapidly can host-associated divergence lead to new species (and why doesn't it always do so, e.g., resulting in "incomplete" speciation)? (ii) How might "speciation genes" function, and how/where would we find them? (iii) Can oscillations from specialists to generalists and back to specialists help explain global diversity in herbivorous insects? (iv) How could recombinant interspecific hybridization lead to divergence and speciation? From ancient phytochemically defined angiosperm affiliations to recent and very local geographical mosaics, the Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies) have provided a model for enhanced understanding of ecological patterns and evolutionary processes, including host-associated genetic divergence, genomic mosaics, genetic hitchhiking and sex-linked speciation genes. Apparent homoploid hybrid speciation in Papilio appears to have been catalyzed by climate warming-induced interspecific introgression of some, but not all, species diagnostic traits, reflecting strong divergent selection (discordant), especially on the Z (= X) chromosome. Reproductive isolation of these novel recombinant hybrid genotypes appears to be accomplished via a delayed post-diapause emergence or temporal isolation, and is perhaps aided by the thermal landscape. Changing thermal landscapes appear to have created (and may destroy) novel recombinant hybrid genotypes and hybrid species.	2011	10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01367.x		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Review paper	FALSE			FALSE	
Slotman, M; Della Torre, A; Powell, JR	Female sterility in hybrids between Anopheles gambiae and A-arabiensis, and the causes of Haldane's rule	EVOLUTION	Although F-1 female hybrids between Anopheles gambiae and A. arabiensis are fully fertile, sterility is present in backcross females. Here we report the results of a study into the genetic basis of backcross female sterility. Using 23 markers, we performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping analyses to identify chromosomal regions involved in hybrid female sterility. We found that female sterility in backcrosses in both directions is primarily caused by interspecific interactions between a heterozygous X chromosome and recessive autosomal factors. In addition, our data provide support for two theories implicated in Haldane's rule in a single taxon. A comparison with data from a previous study shows that male hybrid sterility QTL are present in higher numbers than female hybrid sterility QTL. Furthermore, autosomal female sterility factors tend to be recessive, supporting the dominance theory for female sterility. Finally, our data indicate a very large effect of the X chromosome from both species on hybrid female sterility, despite the fact that the X chromosome represents less than 9% of the genome. However, this could be the result of a lack of introgression of the X chromosome between A. gambiae and A. arabiensis, rather than a faster evolution of sterility factors on the X chromosome.	2005			Insects			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Slotman, MA; Della Torre, A; Calzetta, M; Powell, JR	Differential introgression of chromsomal regions between Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE	Evidence for introgression between Anopheles gambiae and An. arabiensis has accumulated for some time. We examined the fate of introgressed DNA directly, using microsatellite markers located throughout the genome. Introgressed X chromosomes were removed within two generations. Furthermore, substantial differences in introgressive capacity between the two autosomes were found. After introgression from An. arabiensis into An. gambiae, most introgressed alleles at third chromosome markers, particularly those on 3R, decreased steadily, indicating selection against them. No such pattern was observed for 2L markers and several 2P markers. The frequency of introgressed alleles on 2L were close to the original frequency even after 19 generations, whereas only two 21? markers showed a modest decrease. Even though limited information was available on the reciprocal cross, the pattern appears to be identical. Although the decrease in frequency of the introgressed X chromosome can be attributed to the presence of sterility and inviability effects, the variation in introgressive capacity of the autosomes does not appear to be explained by the presence of inversion polymorphisms, or regions causing hybrid sterility and inviability. These results can have some important implications for the spread of insecticide resistance and the control of these vector populations via the release of transgenic mosquitoes.	2005	10.4269/ajtmh.2005.73.326		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Thongatabam, B.; Ramachandra, N. B.	Genomic introgression in laboratory evolved hybrid races, Cytorace 1 and Fissioncytorace-1 of Nasuta-albomicans complex (NAC) of Drosophila (Insecta, Diptera) as revealed by RAPD and ISSR markers	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY	Nasuta-albomicans complex (NAC) of Drosophila is an artificial hybrid zone comprising of Drosophila nasuta nasuta, Drosophila nasuta albomicans and 16 Cytoraces, which are the evolutionary products of a long range hybridization experiment conducted in the laboratory environment. Occurrence of centric fission in the X3 chromosome of Cytorace 1 led to the derivation of Fissioncytorace-1. Molecular techniques have emerged as powerful and valuable tools for detection and exploitation of genetic polymorphism. In the present study, Cytorace 1 and Fissioncytorace-1 were subjected to Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) analyses to determine the introgression of D. n. nasuta and D. n. albomicans genomes. It was found that Cytorace 1 and Fissioncytorace-1 exhibit similarities in RAPD and ISSR profiles although different combinations of genomic regions could have favoured Fissioncytorace-1, for better morphophenotypes and fitness, when compared to Cytorace 1, which has existed for over 15 years from the time of its evolution in the laboratory environment.	2012	10.1080/11250003.2012.696151		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Turissini, D. A.; Liu, G.; David, J. R.; Matute, D. R.	The evolution of reproductive isolation in the Drosophila yakuba complex of species	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	In the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, the yakuba species complex, D.yakuba, D.santomea and D.teissieri have identical mitochondrial genomes in spite of nuclear differentiation. The first two species can be readily hybridized in the laboratory and produce fertile females and sterile males. They also form hybrids in natural conditions. Nonetheless, the third species, D.teissieri, was thought to be unable to produce hybrids with either D.yakuba or D.santomea. This in turn posed the conundrum of why the three species shared a single mitochondrial genome. In this report, we show that D.teissieri can indeed hybridize with both D.yakuba and D.santomea. The resulting female hybrids from both crosses are fertile, whereas the hybrid males are sterile. We also characterize six isolating mechanisms that might be involved in keeping the three species apart. Our results open the possibility of studying the history of introgression in the yakuba species complex and dissecting the genetic basis of interspecific differences between these three species by genetic mapping.	2015	10.1111/jeb.12588		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Zhang, Linbin; Sun, Tianai; Woldesellassie, Fitsum; Xiao, Hailian; Tao, Yun	Sex Ratio Meiotic Drive as a Plausible Evolutionary Mechanism for Hybrid Male Sterility	PLOS GENETICS	Biological diversity on Earth depends on the multiplication of species or speciation, which is the evolution of reproductive isolation such as hybrid sterility between two new species. An unsolved puzzle is the exact mechanism(s) that causes two genomes to diverge from their common ancestor so that some divergent genes no longer function properly in the hybrids. Here we report genetic analyses of divergent genes controlling male fertility and sex ratio in two very young fruitfly species, Drosophila albomicans and D. nasuta. A majority of the genetic divergence for both traits is mapped to the same regions by quantitative trait loci mappings. With introgressions, six major loci are found to contribute to both traits. This genetic colocalization implicates that genes for hybrid male sterility have evolved primarily for controlling sex ratio. We propose that genetic conflicts over sex ratio may operate as a perpetual dynamo for genome divergence. This particular evolutionary mechanism may largely contribute to the rapid evolution of hybrid male sterility and the disproportionate enrichment of its underlying genes on the X chromosome - two patterns widely observed across animals.	2015	10.1371/journal.pgen.1005073		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Xu, Sen; Spitze, Ken; Ackerman, Matthew S.; Ye, Zhiqiang; Bright, Lydia; Keith, Nathan; Jackson, Craig E.; Shaw, Joseph R.; Lynch, Michael	Hybridization and the Origin of Contagious Asexuality in Daphnia pulex	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybridization plays a potentially important role in the origin of obligate parthenogenesis (OP) in many organisms. However, it remains controversial whether hybridization directly triggers the transition from sexual reproduction to obligate asexuality or a hybrid genetic background enables asexual species to persist. Furthermore, we know little about the specific genetic elements from the divergent, yet still hybridizing lineages responsible for this transition and how these elements are further spread to create other OP lineages. In this study, we address these questions in Daphnia pulex, where cyclically parthenogenetic (CP) and OP lineages coexist. Ancestry estimates and whole-genome association mapping using 32 OP isolates suggest that a complex hybridization history between the parental species D. pulex and D. pulicaria is responsible for the introgression of a set of 647 D. pulicaria single nucleotide polymorphism alleles that show perfect association with OP. Crossing experiments using males of OP lineages and females of CP lineages strongly support a polygenic basis for OP. Single-sperm analyses show that although normal meiotic recombination occurs in the production of haploid sperm by males of OP lineages, a significant proportion of such sperm are polyploid, suggesting that the spread of asexual elements through these males (i.e., contagious asexuality) is much less efficient than previously envisioned. Although the current Daphnia genome annotation does not provide mechanistic insight into the nature of the asexuality-associated alleles, these alleles should be considered as candidates for future investigations on the genetic underpinnings of OP.	2015	10.1093/molbev/msv190		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Bi, Yu; Ren, Xiaoliang; Li, Runsheng; Ding, Qiutao; Xie, Dongying; Zhao, Zhongying	Specific Interactions Between Autosome and X Chromosomes Cause Hybrid Male Sterility in Caenorhabditis Species	GENETICS	Hybrid male progeny from interspecies crosses are more prone to sterility or inviability than hybrid female progeny, and the male sterility and inviability often demonstrate parent-of-origin asymmetry. However, the underlying genetic mechanism of asymmetric sterility or inviability remains elusive. We previously established a genome-wide hybrid incompatibility (HI) landscape between Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni by phenotyping a large collection of C. nigoni strains each carrying a C. briggsae introgression. In this study, we systematically dissect the genetic mechanism of asymmetric sterility and inviability in both hybrid male and female progeny between the two species. Specifically, we performed reciprocal crosses between C. briggsae and different C. nigoni strains that each carry a GFP-labeled C. briggsae genomic fragment referred to as introgression, and scored the HI phenotypes in the F1 progeny. The aggregated introgressions cover 94.6% of the C. briggsae genome, including 100% of the X chromosome. Surprisingly, we observed that two C. briggsae X fragments that produce C. nigoni male sterility as an introgression rescued hybrid F1 sterility in males fathered by C. briggsae. Subsequent backcrossing analyses indicated that a specific interaction between the X-linked interaction and one autosome introgression is required to rescue the hybrid male sterility. In addition, we identified another two C. briggsae genomic intervals on chromosomes II and IV that can rescue the inviability, but not the sterility, of hybrid F1 males fathered by C. nigoni, suggesting the involvement of differential epistatic interactions in the asymmetric hybrid male fertility and inviability. Importantly, backcrossing of the rescued sterile males with C. nigoni led to the isolation of a 1.1-Mb genomic interval that specifically interacts with an X-linked introgression, which is essential for hybrid male fertility. We further identified three C. briggsae genomic intervals on chromosome I, II, and III that produced inviability in all F1 progeny, dependent on or independent of the parent-of-origin. Taken together, we identified multiple independent interacting loci that are responsible for asymmetric hybrid male and female sterility, and inviability, which lays a foundation for their molecular characterization.	2019	10.1534/genetics.119.302202		Nematode			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Bi, Yu; Ren, Xiaoliang; Yan, Cheung; Shao, Jiaofang; Xie, Dongying; Zhao, Zhongying	A Genome-Wide Hybrid Incompatibility Landscape between Caenorhabditis briggsae and C-nigoni	PLOS GENETICS	Systematic characterization of hybrid incompatibility (HI) between related species remains the key to understanding speciation. The genetic basis of HI has been intensively studied in Drosophila species, but remains largely unknown in other species, including nematodes, which is mainly due to the lack of a sister species with which C. elegans can mate and produce viable progeny. The recent discovery of a C. briggsae sister species, C. nigoni, has opened up the possibility of dissecting the genetic basis of HI in nematode species. However, the paucity of dominant and visible marker prevents the efficient mapping of HI loci between the two species. To elucidate the genetic basis of speciation in nematode species, we first generated 96 chromosomally integrated GFP markers in the C. briggsae genome and mapped them into the defined locations by PCR and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Aided by the marker, we backcrossed the GFP-associated C. briggsae genomic fragments into C. nigoni for at least 15 generations and produced 111 independent introgressions. The introgression fragments cover most of the C. briggsae genome. We finally dissected the patterns of HI by scoring the embryonic lethality, larval arrest, sex ratio and male sterility for each introgression line, through which we identified pervasive HI loci and produced a genome-wide landscape of HI between the two nematode species, the first of its type for any non-Drosophila species. The HI data not only provided insights into the genetic basis of speciation, but also established a framework for the possible cloning of HI loci between the two nematode species. Furthermore, the data on hybrids confirmed Haldane's rule and suggested the presence of a large X effect in terms of fertility between the two species. Importantly, this work opens a new avenue for studying speciation genetics between nematode species and allows parallel comparison of the HI with that in Drosophila and other species.	2015	10.1371/journal.pgen.1004993		Nematode			TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression. manipulative cross, awesome paper though	FALSE			FALSE	
Combosch, David J.; Vollmer, Steven V.	Trans-Pacific RAD-Seq population genomics confirms introgressive hybridization in Eastern Pacific Pocillopora corals	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Discrepancies between morphology-based taxonomy and phylogenetic systematics are common in Scleractinian corals. In Pocillopora corals, nine recently identified genetic lineages disagree fundamentally with the 17 recognized Pocillopora species, including 5 major Indo-Pacific reef-builders. Pocillopora corals hybridize in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, so it is possible that some of the disagreement between the genetics and taxonomy may be due to introgressive hybridization. Here we used 6769 genome-wide SNPs from Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-Seq) to conduct phylogenomic comparisons among three common, Indo-Pacific Pocillopora species - P. damicomis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans - within and between populations in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and the Central Pacific. Genome-wide RAD-Seq comparisons of Central and TEP Pocillopora confirm that the morphospecies P. damicornis, P. eydouxi and P. elegans are not monophyletic, but instead fall into three distinct genetic groups. However, hybrid samples shared fixed alleles with their respective parental species and, even without strict monophyly, P. damicomis share a common set of 33 species-specific alleles across the Pacific. RAD-Seq data confirm the pattern of one-way introgressive hybridization among TEP Pocillopora, suggesting that introgression may play a role in generating shared, polyphyletic lineages among currently recognized Pocillopora species. Levels of population differentiation within genetic lineages indicate significantly higher levels of population differentiation in the Tropical Eastern Pacific than in the Central West Pacific.

We investigated chromosomes in the freshwater ostracod species Eucypris virens (Jurine, 1820), where sexual, asexual and mixed populations can be found. Our initial karyotyping of multiple populations from Europe and North Africa, both sexual and asexual, revealed a striking variability in chromosome numbers. This would suggest that chromosomal changes are likely to be accelerated in asexuals because the constraints of meiosis are removed. Hence, we employed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) within and among sexual and asexual populations to get insights into E. virens genome arrangements. CGH disclosed substantial genomic imbalances among the populations analyzed, and three patterns of genome arrangement between these populations: 1. Only putative ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-bearing regions were conserved in the two populations compared indicating a high sequence divergence between these populations. This pattern is comparable with our findings at the interspecies level of comparison; 2. Chromosomal regions were shared by both populations to a varying extent with a distinct copy number variation in pericentromeric and presumable rDNA-bearing regions. This indicates a different rate of evolution in repetitive sequences; 3. A mosaic pattern of distribution of genomic material that can be explained as non-reciprocal genetic introgression and evidence of a hybrid origin of these individuals. We show an overall increased chromosomal dynamics in E. virens that is complementary with available phylogenetic and population genetic data reporting highly differentiated diploid sexual and asexual lineages with a wide variety of genetic backgrounds.	2018	10.3390/genes9030150		Insects			TRUE	TRUE	doesn't measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Detwiler, Jillian T.; Criscione, Charles D.	An Infectious Topic in Reticulate Evolution: Introgression and Hybridization in Animal Parasites	GENES	Little attention has been given to the role that introgression and hybridization have played in the evolution of parasites. Most studies are host-centric and ask if the hybrid of a free-living species is more or less susceptible to parasite infection. Here we focus on what is known about how introgression and hybridization have influenced the evolution of protozoan and helminth parasites of animals. There are reports of genome or gene introgression from distantly related taxa into apicomplexans and filarial nematodes. Most common are genetic based reports of potential hybridization among congeneric taxa, but in several cases, more work is needed to definitively conclude current hybridization. In the medically important Trypanosoma it is clear that some clonal lineages are the product of past hybridization events. Similarly, strong evidence exists for current hybridization in human helminths such as Schistosoma and Ascaris. There remain topics that warrant further examination such as the potential hybrid origin of polyploid platyhelminths. Furthermore, little work has investigated the phenotype or fitness, and even less the epidemiological significance of hybrid parasites.	2010	10.3390/genes1010102		Platyhelminthes			TRUE	TRUE	Review.

Taga, Yosuke; Goto, Satomi; Matsunaga, Koji; Togashi, Katsumi	Temporal changes in characteristics of populations originating from interbreeding between Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and B. mucronatus	NEMATOLOGY	To determine the likelihood of introgressive hybridisation between Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and B. mucronatus, interbreeding experiments were performed. Of 240 trials involving 24 reciprocal crosses (ten trials per cross, ten virgin females and ten virgin males per trial) between three B. xylophilus isolates and four B. mucronatus isolates under conditions that allowed F1 hybrids to backcross with parents, 174 produced hybrid juveniles. The others failed to generate juveniles. Twenty trials in four crosses successfully established populations which persisted for 65.8-179.5 days, corresponding to 10-40 generations. Analyses of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments for 20 hybrid-derived populations and analysis of inheritance mode of mitochondrial DNA indicated that three crosses produced populations whose members had the B. mucronatus nuclear genome and B. mucronatus or B. xylophilus cytoplasm, whereas the remaining interbreeding produced populations in which 79% of members examined had the B. xylophilus rDNA and cytoplasm and 17% had rDNA fragments of the two species. Populations composed of heterospecific cytonuclear individuals took longer to eat up Botrytis cinerea mycelial mat in a rearing flask than others. Formation of a tail tip mucro in adult females, a characteristic of B. mucronatus, was suggested to be controlled by nuclear and cytoplasmic genes. The results suggested that the introgression of B. xylophilus genes into the B. mucronctlus genome was easier than introgression in the opposite direction.	2011	10.1163/138855410X543166		Nematode			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Zietara, Marek S.; Rokicka, Magdalena; Stojanovski, Stojmir; Lumme, Jaakko	Introgression of distant mitochondria into the genome of Gyrodactylus salaris: Nuclear and mitochondrial markers are necessary to identify parasite strains	ACTA PARASITOLOGICA	Novel combinations of mitochondrial DNA (CO1) and internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA ( ITS) were detected among Gyrodactylus parasites on brown trout ( Salmo trutta L.), rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)), and Ohrid trout ( Salmo letnica (Karaman)) from salmonid farms in Poland and Macedonia. Some clones differed from standard ITS only by <= 4 nucleotides, but they belonged to a mtDNA clade that differed from the Northern European lineages of G. salaris by d(MCL) = 0.266 +/- 0.108 (maximum composite likelihood distance). The divergence of d(MCL) = 0.013 +/- 0.005 within the alien mtDNA clade suggested introgression from an unknown maternal ancestor into the G. salaris Malmberg genome 137 to 57 kyr ago ( or, less probably, repeated introgression). A comparable modern hybrid was detected based on permanently heterozygous ITS (28 bp/1264 = 2.2%) in a clone that is widespread throughout Finnish rainbow trout farms. This was a F 1 hybrid of maternal G. pomeraniae Kuusela, Zietara et Lumme ( on roach, Rutilus rutilus ( L.)) and G. lavareti Malmberg ( on whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (L.)). The mtDNA of the parental species differed by d(MCL) = 0.290 +/- 0.130. The observations emphasize that both nuclear and maternally-inherited DNA markers are necessary to characterize sexually-produced lineages or clones of Gyrodactylus. The hybridization events demonstrated predict incongruence of mitochondrial vs. nuclear gene trees, i.e., reticulate evolution in species trees.	2010	10.2478/s11686-010-0016-4		Platyhelminthes			TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Borsa, Philippe; Daguin, Claire; Bierne, Nicolas	Genomic reticulation indicates mixed ancestry in Southern-Hemisphere Mytilus spp. mussels	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Previous surveys of allozyme variation in smooth-shell Mytilus spp. mussels have reported the presence in the Southern Hemisphere of both Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels. In the present study, nuclear DNA markers mac-1 and Glu-5'/Glu-3', both diagnostic for Northern-Hemisphere M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis, were used to further characterize the nuclear genomes of M. edulis from Kerguelen and M. galloprovincialis from Tasmania. Genomic reticulation was observed, with typical M. edulis allelomorphs fixed in both populations at locus mac-1 whereas, at locus Glu-5'/Glu-3', allelomorphs characteristic of M. galloprovincialis were present in Kerguelen and nearly fixed in Tasmania. Kerguelen mussels had a genome of mixed M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis ancestry without evidence of barriers to merging as shown by Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. Tasmanian mussels possessed a predominantly M. galloprovincialis genomic background introgressed by M. edulis allelomorphs at locus mac-1. Genetic drift superimposed on ancient hybridization and introgression may explain the genomic reticulation observed in both Kerguelen and Tasmanian mussels. There was no evidence of a recent introduction of Northern-Hemisphere M. galloprovincialis or M. edulis to Kerguelen or Tasmania.

Gerard, Karin; Bierne, Nicolas; Borsa, Philippe; Chenuil, Anne; Feral, Jean-Pierre	Pleistocene separation of mitochondrial lineages of Mytilus spp. mussels from Northern and Southern Hemispheres and strong genetic differentiation among southern populations	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Smooth-shelled mussels, Mytilus spp., have an antitropical distribution. In the Northern Hemisphere, the M. edulis complex of species is composed of three genetically well delineated taxa: M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. In the Southern Hemisphere, morphological characters, allozymes and intron length polymorphisms suggest that Mytilus spp. populations from South America and Kerguelen Islands are related to M. edulis and those from Australasia to M. galloprovincialis. On the other hand, a phylogeny of the 16S rDNA mitochondrial locus demonstrates a clear distinctiveness of southern mussels and suggests that they are related to Mediterranean M. galloprovincialis. Here, we analysed the faster-evolving cytochrome oxidase subunit I locus. The divergence between haplotypes of populations from the two hemispheres was confirmed and was found to predate the divergence between haplotypes of northern M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis. In addition, strong genetic structure was detected among the southern samples. revealing three genetic entities that correspond to (1) South America and Kerguelen Island, (2) Tasmania, (3) New Zealand. Using the trans-Arctic interchange as a molecular clock calibration, we estimated the time since divergence of populations from the two hemispheres to be between 0.5 million years (MY) and 1.3 MY (average 0.84 MY). The contrasting patterns observed for the nuclear and the organelle genomes suggested two alternative, complex scenarios: two trans-equatorial migrations and the existence of differential barriers to mitochondrial and nuclear gene flow, or a single trans-equatorial migration and a view of the composition of the nuclear genome biased by taxonomic preconception.

Zbawicka, Malgorzata; Burzynski, Artur; Skibinski, David; Wenne, Roman	Scottish Mytilus trossulus mussels retain ancestral mitochondrial DNA: Complete sequences of male and female mtDNA genomes	GENE	Mytilus trossulus mussels occur in North America and in the Baltic Sea. Recently genetic markers for the three Mytilus subspecies M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and M. trossulus, have been detected at Loch Etive in Scotland suggesting mixed ancestry for this population. Of particular interest is the evidence that M. trossulus occurs at Loch Etive because it had not previously been reported in the British Isles. In the present study, analysis of subspecies-specific diagnostic nuclear DNA markers confirms the presence of a high frequency of mussels with M. trossulus ancestry at Loch Etive. The genetic structure suggests hybridisation at an intermediate stage compared with North American populations, where there is little hybridisation, and Baltic populations where there is extensive introgression. This points strongly against a Baltic origin for Loch Etive M. trossulus. The F and M mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of Baltic M. trossulus are similar in sequence to the corresponding genomes in M. edulis and believed to be derived by introgression from that subspecies. Both F and M mtDNA genomes are observed at Loch Etive consistent with the presence of doubly uniparental inheritance. Here we provide the complete sequences of the three M. trossulus mtDNA genomes (one F and two M) from Loch Etive. These genomes are extremely similar to the corresponding genomes from ancestral M. trossulus in America but divergent from the genomes for Baltic M. trossulus. This is the first report of ancestral M. trossulus mtDNA genomes in Europe. The F and M genomes are diverged by 26% in nucleotide sequence, similar to other Mytilus F and M genomes. The gene arrangement in the sequenced genomes is also similar to that in other sequenced Mytilus mtDNA genomes. However the two sequenced M genomes differ by 960 bp which is caused by a duplication in the main noncoding region (CR). This duplication has not so far been observed in North American populations of M. trossulus. The coding regions of the Loch Etive genomes have no features suggesting that they are other than functional genomes and have K-a/K-s values in coding regions less than one indicative of purifying selection. Estimates of divergence times were made for both genomes and are consistent with invasion of Loch Etive by M. trossulus towards the end of the last glacial period. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Borlase, Anna; Webster, Joanne P.; Rudge, James W.	Opportunities and challenges for modelling epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics in a multihost, multiparasite system: Zoonotic hybrid schistosomiasis in West Africa	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Multihost multiparasite systems are evolutionarily and ecologically dynamic, which presents substantial trans-disciplinary challenges for elucidating their epidemiology and designing appropriate control. Evidence for hybridizations and introgressions between parasite species is gathering, in part in line with improvements in molecular diagnostics and genome sequencing. One major system where this is becoming apparent is within the Genus Schistosoma, where schistosomiasis represents a disease of considerable medical and veterinary importance, the greatest burden of which occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. Interspecific hybridizations and introgressions bring an increased level of complexity over and above that already inherent within multihost, multiparasite systems, also representing an additional source of genetic variation that can drive evolution. This has the potential for profound implications for the control of parasitic diseases, including, but not exclusive to, widening host range, increased transmission potential and altered responses to drug therapy. Here, we present the challenging case example of haematobium group Schistosoma spp. hybrids in West Africa, a system involving multiple interacting parasites and multiple definitive hosts, in a region where zoonotic reservoirs of schistosomiasis were not previously considered to be of importance. We consider how existing mathematical model frameworks for schistosome transmission could be expanded and adapted to zoonotic hybrid systems, exploring how such model frameworks can utilize molecular and epidemiological data, as well as the complexities and challenges this presents. We also highlight the opportunities and value such mathematical models could bring to this and a range of similar multihost, multi and cross-hybridizing parasites systems in our changing world.	2018	10.1111/eva.12529		Platyhelminthes			TRUE	TRUE	mathematical model	FALSE			FALSE	
Bouchemousse, Sarah; Leveque, Laurent; Dubois, Guillaume; Viard, Frederique	Co-occurrence and reproductive synchrony do not ensure hybridization between an alien tunicate and its interfertile native congener	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY	Biological invasions can promote secondary contacts between related species and thus provide excellent case studies for investigating the joint ecological and evolutionary trajectories of interfertile taxa. Here, we studied two tunicates living in sympatry, and sometimes in syntopy, in the English Channel, Ciona intestinalis species A (presumed native to the NW Pacific) and species B (native to the N Atlantic). In addition to monitoring their co-existence over time, we examined the level of interspecific gene flow, a process that may increase the invasiveness of the non-native species. The sampling scheme was repeated twice a year for 3 years (six distinct generations) to determine the relative abundance of the two species in 11 localities along the coasts of the English Channel and the Iroise Sea (covering 1600 km) in Brittany, France. We examined 23,000 individuals, including 5315 specimens for which reproductive status was determined. Four species-diagnostic molecular markers traced interspecific gene flow on a random subset of 3048 individuals. Regardless of the sampling date, the two species co-occurred in most of the study sites, with species A showing higher frequency in the autumn. The regional pattern of seasonal variation in relative abundance of the two congeners appears to correspond to different thermal growth optima. Abrupt variations in environmental parameters can act synergistically and may favor the non-native species locally. Despite syntopy, synchronous gamete production and successful in vitro interspecific crosses, only 4.3 % individuals showed an admixed genome (i.e. footprint of present-day or past introgression events), most of them with a species A maternal lineage, of which only one was a putative first generation hybrid. Altogether, efficient barriers seem to prevent interspecific crosses between the two interfertile congeners in the wild: present-day hybridization may have less impact than competitive interactions on the fate of the two study species over their sympatric range.	2016	10.1007/s10682-015-9788-1		Tunicate			TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Cerda, Peter A.; Hewitt, Trevor L.; Haponski, Amanda E.; Duda, Thomas F., Jr.	Unraveling cryptic morphological diversity in a marine snail species complex using nuclear genomic data	AMERICAN MALACOLOGICAL BULLETIN	Conus lividus (Hwass in Bruguiere, 1792) and Conus sanguinolentus (Quoy and Gaimard, 1834) are closely related Indo-West Pacific cone snails that have largely overlapping distributions. Previous population genetic analyses of these species found that some individuals that were identified as C lividus possessed mitochondrial gene sequences that were similar or in some cases identical to those of C sanguinolentus. While these species tend to be easily distinguished based on shell color patterns, it is possible that some individuals of C. sanguinolentus were misidentified as C. lividus. The result though could also be due to introgression of the mitochondrial genome of C. sanguinolentus into C. lividus. We used a ddRAD approach to obtain sequences of short fragments of more than 7,000 nuclear genomic loci to examine patterns of variation and evaluate these explanations. Results showed that the two parental species are genetically differentiated at nuclear loci and all putative hybrids were unambiguously assigned to C. sanguinolentus based on shared patterns of variation. These results demonstrate that variation in shell color patterns of C. sanguinolentus overlaps with that of C. lividus, and extend the distribution of C. sanguinolentus into the Hawaiian Archipelago. Additional analyses of patterns of genetic variation among populations of the two species revealed that while C. lividus shows no genetic population structure, the population of C. sanguinolentus from Hawaii is genetically differentiated from populations elsewhere as found in prior analyses based on mitochondrial sequence data.	2019	10.4003/006.037.0201		Mollusc			FALSE	FALSE	Can't find the article 	FALSE			FALSE	
Diaz-Puente, Borja; Pita, Alfonso; Uribe, Juan; Cuellar-Pinzon, Jose; Guinez, Ricardo; Presa, Pablo	A biogeography-based management for Mytilus chilensis: The genetic hodgepodge of Los Lagos versus the pristine hybrid zone of the Magellanic ecotone	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS	This study was intended to identify mussel species from the Magellanic ecotone, quantifying interspecific hybridization within Mytilus and depicting the genetic architecture of Mytilus chilensis in its South Pacific range. The analysis comprises the sub-Antarctic Magallanes Province as a rich ecotone of climates, ecosystems and admixed faunas embedded among the biogeographic regions of the Pacific, the Atlantic, and Antarctica. Highly conserved molecular sequences within species were used to identify species, and polymorphic microsatellites were used to calculate the genetic architecture of M. chilensis. The absence of the invasive species Mytilus galloprovincialis from the M. chilensis range clarifies previous doubts on its expansion southward from the Arauco Gulf. The ubiquitous presence of the typical Glu-5 '-Me-15/16 PAP allele of Mytilus trossulus in the Northern Hemisphere might come from hull biofouling, but rather it seems to be an ancient polymorphism conserved in M. chilensis as occurs in blue mussels from other regions of the Southern Hemisphere. There is a very limited connectivity (F-ST = 0.167) between two latitudinal gene pools of M. chilensis that are highly divergent in composition, architecture, and ecological relevance. Fifty years of aquaculture enhancement in Los Lagos explains its high diversity and genetic heterogeneity among patches, so its mussel management should seek a balance between exploitation and environmental sustainability. The Magellanic ecotone bears a pristine M. chilensis x Mytilus edulis platensis hybrid zone around the Southern Cone, larger (450 km) than previously thought. Such a hybrid zone permeates one of the last remaining wilderness areas in the world (Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve) and is a natural laboratory for addressing introgression, hybridization, and evolution of Mytilus spp. genomes in their last southern frontier.	2020	10.1002/aqc.3271		Mollusc			TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.

Smietanka, B.; Burzynski, A.; Hummel, H.; Wenne, R.	Glacial history of the European marine mussels Mytilus, inferred from distribution of mitochondrial DNA lineages	HEREDITY	Mussels of the genus Mytilus have been used to assess the circumglacial phylogeography of the intertidal zone. These mussels are representative components of the intertidal zone and have rapidly evolving mitochondrial DNA, suitable for high resolution phylogeographic analyses. In Europe, the three Mytilus species currently share mitochondrial haplotypes, owing to the cases of extensive genetic introgression. Genetic diversity of Mytilus edulis, Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus galloprovincialis was studied using a 900-bp long part of the most variable fragment of the control region from one of their two mitochondrial genomes. To this end, 985 specimens were sampled along the European coasts, at sites ranging from the Black Sea to the White Sea. The relevant DNA fragments were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Contrary to the earlier findings, our coalescence and nested cladistics results show that only a single M. edulis glacial refugium existed in the Atlantic. Despite that, the species survived the glaciation retaining much of its diversity. Unsurprisingly, M. galloprovincialis survived in the Mediterranean Sea. In a relatively short time period, around the climatic optimum at 10 ky ago, the species underwent rapid expansion coupled with population differentiation. Following the expansion, further contemporary gene flow between populations was limited.	2014	10.1038/hdy.2014.23		Mollusc			TRUE	TRUE	Did not calculate introgression.	FALSE			FALSE

Amador, Carmen; Hayes, Ben J.; Daetwyler, Hans D.	Genomic selection for recovery of original genetic background from hybrids of endangered and common breeds	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Critically endangered breeds and populations are often crossed with more common breeds or subspecies. This results in genetic admixture that can be undesirable when it challenges the genetic integrity of wild and domestic populations, causing a loss in special characteristics or unique genetic material and ultimately extinction. Here, we present two genomic selection strategies, using genome-wide DNA markers, to recover the genomic content of the original endangered population from admixtures. Each strategy relies on the estimation of the proportion of nonintrogressed genome in individuals based on a different method: either genomic prediction or identification of breed-specific haplotypes. Then, breeding programs that remove introgressed genomic information can be designed. To test these strategies, we used empirical 50K SNP array data from two pure sheep breeds, Merino (used as target breed), Poll Dorset and an existing admixed population of both breeds. Sheep populations with varying degrees of introgression and admixture were simulated starting from these real genotypes. Both strategies were capable of identifying segment origin, and both removed up to the 100% of the Poll Dorset segments. While the selection process led to substantial inbreeding, we controlled it by imposing a minimum number of individuals contributing to the next generation.	2014	10.1111/eva.12113		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	was about "de-introgression mathods"	FALSE			FALSE

Baker, Robert J.; Bradley, Robert D.	Speciation in mammals and the genetic species concept	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY	We define a genetic species as a group of genetically compatible interbreeding natural populations that is genetically isolated from other such groups. This focus on genetic isolation rather than reproductive isolation distinguishes the Genetic Species Concept from the Biological Species Concept. Recognition of species that are genetically isolated (but not reproductively isolated) results in an enhanced understanding of biodiversity and the nature of speciation as well as speciation-based issues and evolution of mammals. We review criteria and methods for recognizing species of mammals and explore a theoretical scenario, the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model, for understanding and predicting genetic diversity and speciation in mammals. If the BDM model is operating in mammals, then genetically defined phylogroups would be predicted to occur within species defined by morphology, and phylogroups experiencing stabilizing selection will evolve genetic isolation without concomitant morphological diversification. Such species will be undetectable using classical skin and skull morphology (Morphological Species Concept). Using cytochrome-b data from sister species of mammals recognized by classical morphological studies, we estimated the number of phylogroups that exist within mammalian species and hypothesize that there will be > 2,000 currently unrecognized species of mammals. Such an underestimation significantly affects conclusions on the nature of speciation in mammals, barriers associated with evolution of genetic isolation, estimates of biodiversity, design of conservation initiatives, zoonoses, and so on. A paradigm shift relative to this and other speciation-based issues will be needed. Data that will be effective in detecting these "morphologically cryptic genetic species" are genetic, especially DNA-sequence data. Application of the Genetic Species Concept uses genetic data from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to identify species and species boundaries, the extent to which the integrity of the gene pool is protected, nature of hybridization (if present), and introgression. Genetic data are unique in understanding species because the use of genetic data 1) can quantify genetic divergence from different aspects of the genome (mitochondrial and nuclear genes, protein coding genes, regulatory genes, mobile DNA, microsatellites, chromosomal rearrangements, heterochromatin, etc.); 2) can provide divergence values that increase with time, providing an estimate of time since divergence; 3) can provide a population genetics perspective; 4) is less subject to convergence and parallelism relative to other sets of characters; 5) can identify monophyly, sister taxa, and presence or absence of introgression; and 6) can accurately identify hybrid individuals (kinship and source of hybrid individuals, F(1)s, backcrosses, direction of hybridization, and in concert with other data identify which hybrids are sterile or fertile). The proposed definition of the Genetic Species Concept is more compatible with a description of biodiversity of mammals than is "reproductively isolated species." Genetic profiles of mammalian species will result in a genetic description of species and mammalian diversity, and such studies are being accelerated by technological advances that reduce cost and increase speed and efficiency of generating genetic data. We propose that this genetic revolution remain museum- and voucher specimen-based and that new names are based on a holotype (including associated tissues) deposited in an accredited museum.	2006	10.1644/06-MAMM-F-038R2.1		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	review paper of species concepts	FALSE			FALSE

Hybrid sterility is one of the reproductive isolation mechanisms restricting gene flow between closely related, sexually reproducing organisms. We showed that hybrid sterility between two closely related mouse subspecies is executed by a failure of meiotic synapsis of orthologous chromosomes in F1 hybrid males. The asynapsis of orthologous chromosomes occurred in meiosis of male and female hybrids, though only males were sterile due to trans-acting male-specific hybrid sterility genes. We located one of the two major hybrid sterility genes to a 4.7 Mb interval on Chromosome X, showed that it controls male sterility by modulating the extent of meiotic asynapsis and using the inter-subspecific chromosome substitution strains we refuted the simple interpretation of dominance theory of Haldane's rule. A new working hypothesis posits male sterility of mouse inter-subsubspecific F1 hybrids as a consequence of meiotic chromosome asynapsis caused by the cis-acting mismatch between orthologous chromosomes modulated by the trans-acting hybrid male sterility genes. Hybrid sterility (HS) belongs to reproductive isolation barriers that safeguard the integrity of species in statu nascendi. Although hybrid sterility occurs almost universally among animal and plant species, most of our current knowledge comes from the classical genetic studies on Drosophila interspecific crosses or introgressions. With the house mouse subspecies Mus m. musculus and Mus m. domesticus as a model, new research tools have become available for studies of the molecular mechanisms and genetic networks underlying HS. Here we used QTL analysis and intersubspecific chromosome substitution strains to identify a 4.7 Mb critical region on Chromosome X (Chr X) harboring the Hstx2 HS locus, which causes asymmetrical spermatogenic arrest in reciprocal intersubspecific F1 hybrids. Subsequently, we mapped autosomal loci on Chrs 3, 9 and 13 that can abolish this asymmetry. Combination of immunofluorescent visualization of the proteins of synaptonemal complexes with whole-chromosome DNA FISH on pachytene spreads revealed that heterosubspecific, unlike consubspecific, homologous chromosomes are predisposed to asynapsis in F1 hybrid male and female meiosis. The asynapsis is under the trans- control of Hstx2 and Hst1/Prdm9 hybrid sterility genes in pachynemas of male but not female hybrids. The finding concurred with the fertility of intersubpecific F1 hybrid females homozygous for the Hstx2(Mmm) allele and resolved the apparent conflict with the dominance theory of Haldane's rule. We propose that meiotic asynapsis in intersubspecific hybrids is a consequence of cis-acting mismatch between homologous chromosomes modulated by the trans-acting Hstx2 and Prdm9 hybrid male sterility genes.	2014	10.1371/journal.pgen.1004088		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Bohling, Justin H.; Dellinger, Justin; McVey, Justin M.; Cobb, David T.; Moorman, Christopher E.; Waits, Lisette P.	Describing a developing hybrid zone between red wolves and coyotes in eastern North Carolina, USA	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	When hybridizing species come into contact, understanding the processes that regulate their interactions can help predict the future outcome of the system. This is especially relevant in conservation situations where human activities can influence hybridization dynamics. We investigated a developing hybrid zone between red wolves and coyotes in North Carolina, USA to elucidate patterns of hybridization in a system heavily managed for preservation of the red wolf genome. Using noninvasive genetic sampling of scat, we surveyed a 2880 km 2 region adjacent to the Red Wolf Experimental Population Area (RWEPA). We combined microsatellite genotypes collected from this survey with those from companion studies conducted both within and outside the RWEPA to describe the gradient of red wolf ancestry. A total of 311 individuals were genotyped at 17 loci and red wolf ancestry decreased along an east-west gradient across the RWEPA. No red wolves were found outside the RWEPA, yet half of individuals found within this area were coyotes. Hybrids composed only 4% of individuals within this landscape despite co-occurrence of the two species throughout the RWEPA. The low proportion of hybrids suggests that a combination of active management and natural isolating mechanisms may be limiting intermixing within this hybrid system.	2016	10.1111/eva.12388		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	used FST and STRUCURE	FALSE			FALSE	
Bunlungsup, Srichan; Kanthaswamy, Sree; Oldt, Robert F.; Smith, David Glenn; Houghton, Paul; Hamada, Yuzuru; Malaivijitnond, Suchinda	Genetic analysis of samples from wild populations opens new perspectives on hybridization between long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY	In the past decade, many researchers have published papers about hybridization between long-tailed and rhesus macaques. These previous works have proposed unidirectional gene flow with the Isthmus of Kra as the zoogeographical barrier of hybridization. However, these reports analyzed specimens of unknown origin and/or did not include specimens from Thailand, the center of the proposed area of hybridization. Collected specimens of long-tailed and rhesus macaques representing all suspected hybridization areas were examined. Blood samples from four populations each of long-tailed and rhesus macaques inhabiting Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos were collected and analyzed with conspecific references from China (for rhesus macaques) and multiple countries from Sundaic regions (for long-tailed macaques). Ninety-six single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers specifically designed to interrogate admixture and ancestry were used in genotyping. We found genetic admixture maximized at the hybrid zone (15-20 degrees N), as well as admixture signals of varying strength in both directions outside of the hybrid zone. These findings show that the Isthmus of Kra is not a barrier to gene flow from rhesus to long-tailed populations. However, to precisely identify a southernmost barrier, if in fact a boundary rather than simple isolation by distance exists, the samples from peninsular Malaysia must be included in the analysis. Additionally, a long-tailed to rhesus gene flow boundary was found between northern Thailand and Myanmar.

X-Y Interactions Underlie Sperm Head Abnormality in Hybrid Male House Mice	GENETICS	The genetic basis of hybrid male sterility in house mice is complex, highly polygenic, and strongly X linked. Previous work suggested that there might be interactions between the Mus musculus musculus X and the M. m. domesticus Y with a large negative effect on sperm head morphology in hybrid males with an F-1 autosomal background. To test this, we introgressed the M. m. domesticus Y onto a M. m. musculus background and measured the change in sperm morphology, testis weight, and sperm count across early backcross generations and in 11th generation backcross males in which the opportunity for X-autosome incompatibilities is effectively eliminated. We found that abnormality in sperm morphology persists in M. m. domesticus Y introgression males, and that this phenotype is rescued by M. m. domesticus introgressions on the X chromosome. In contrast, the severe reductions in testis weight and sperm count that characterize F-1 males were eliminated after one generation of backcrossing. These results indicate that X-Y incompatibilities contribute specifically to sperm morphology. In contrast, X-autosome incompatibilities contribute to low testis weight, low sperm count, and sperm morphology. Restoration of normal testis weight and sperm count in first generation backcross males suggests that a small number of complex incompatibilities between loci on the M. m. musculus X and the M. m. domesticus autosomes underlie F-1 male sterility. Together, these results provide insight into the genetic architecture of F-1 male sterility and help to explain genome-wide patterns of introgression across the house mouse hybrid zone.	2014	10.1534/genetics.114.161703		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	expieremental crosses and noted lack of introgression 	FALSE			FALSE	
Carneiro, Jeferson; da Silva Rodrigues-Filho, Luis Fernando; Schneider, Horacio; Sampaio, Iracilda	Molecular data highlight hybridization in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri, Cebidae)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY	Hybridization has been reported increasingly frequently in recent years, fueling the debate on its role in the evolutionary history of species. Some studies have shown that hybridization is very common in captive New World primates, and hybrid offspring have phenotypes and physiological responses distinct from those of the "pure" parents, due to gene introgression. Here we used the TA15 Alu insertion to investigate hybridization in the genus Saimiri. Our results indicate the hybridization of Saimiri boliviensis peruviensis with S. sciureus macrodon, and S. b. boliviensis with S. ustus. Unexpectedly, some hybrids of both S. boliviensis peruviensis and S. b. boliviensis were homozygous for the absence of the insertion, which indicates that the hybrids were fertile.	2016	10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2016-0091		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	biogeographic more than anything	FALSE			FALSE

Here we report genome sequences of EastMCMV (from Eastern mice), and set these in the context of MCMV genomes from genus Mus hosts. We show EastMCMV and WestMCMV are genetically distinct. Phylogeny splitting analyses show a genome wide (94%) pattern consistent with no West-East introgression, the major exception (3.8%) being a genome-terminal region of duplicated genes involved in host immune system evasion. As expected from its function, this is a region of maintenance of ancestral polymorphism: The lack of clear splitting signal cannot be interpreted as evidence of introgression. The EastMCMV genome sequences reported here can therefore serve as a well-described resource for exploration of murid MCMV diversity.	2018	10.1016/j.virol.2018.05.023		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Colella, Jocelyn P.; Wilson, Robert E.; Talbot, Sandra L.; Cook, Joseph A.	Implications of introgression for wildlife translocations: the case of North American martens	CONSERVATION GENETICS	The evolutionary consequences of natural introgression provide a rare opportunity to retrospectively evaluate how the introduction of exotics or genetic rescue efforts may impact endemic faunas. Phylogeographic structure among mainland, endemic insular, and introduced North American marten (Martes americana and M. caurina) populations have been shaped by a complex history of natural, post-glacial population expansion followed by a series of anthropogenic introductions. In some cases, both natural colonization and translocations facilitated secondary contact, offering a series of replicated experiments that demonstrate how introgression, in these cases following isolation (insular and refugial), shapes genetic diversity. We test whether genetic exchange is occurring between North American marten species using mitochondrial genomes and ten nuclear loci. We present evidence of biased nuclear introgression from M. caurina into M. americana across two natural hybrid zones (insular and mainland) and found no remnant evidence of M. caurina on islands that received M. americana translocations, suggesting prior absence, potential extirpation, or genetic swamping of M. caurina from these islands. Our results highlight the importance of understanding phylogeographic variation prior to identifying source populations for wildlife translocations and caution the use of genetic rescue for North American marten populations. Although previously managed as a single species, these two species show substantial genetic divergence. When the two are placed into contact, they exhibit unidirectional, asymmetric introgression with potentially negative consequences for M. caurina, underscoring the value of mindful consideration of introgression in wildlife management.	2019	10.1007/s10592-018-1120-5		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	seem to used every summary stat in the book but the ones we are interested in	FALSE			FALSE

D.; Canales-Espinosa, Domingo	Reduced Introgression of Sex Chromosome Markers in the Mexican Howler Monkey (Alouatta palliata x A-pigra) Hybrid Zone	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY	Interspecific hybridization allows the introgression or movement of alleles from one genome to another. While some genomic regions freely exchange alleles during hybridization, loci associated with reproductive isolation do not intermix. In many model organisms, the X chromosome displays limited introgression compared to autosomes owing to the presence of multiple loci associated with hybrid sterility or inviability (the "large X-effect"). Similarly, if hybrids are produced, the heterogametic sex is usually inviable or sterile, a pattern known as Haldane's rule. We analyzed the patterns of introgression of genetic markers located in the mitochondrial (control region) and nuclear (autosomal microsatellites and sex chromosome genes) genomes of two howler monkey species (Alouatta palliata and A. pigra) that form a natural hybrid zone in southern Mexico, to evaluate whether the large X-effect and Haldane's rule affect the outcomes of hybridization between these sister species. To identify the level of admixture of each individual in the hybrid zone (N=254) we analyzed individuals sampled outside the hybrid zone (109 A. pigra and 39 A. palliata) to determine allele frequencies of parental species and estimated a hybrid index based on nuclear markers. We then performed a cline analysis using individuals in the hybrid zone to determine patterns of introgression for each locus. Our analyses show that although the hybrid zone is bimodal (with no known F1 s and few recent generation hybrids) and quite narrow, there has been extensive introgression in both directions, and there is a large array of admixed individuals in the hybrid zone. Mitochondrial and most autosomal markers showed bidirectional introgression, but some had biased introgression toward one species or the other. All markers on the sex chromosomes and a few autosomal markers showed highly restricted introgression. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that the sex chromosomes make a disproportionate contribution to reproductive isolation, and our results broaden the taxonomic representation of these patterns across animal taxa.	2019	10.1007/s10764-018-0056-4		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

Forgacs, David; Wallen, Rick L.; Dobson, Lauren K.; Derr, James N.	Mitochondrial Genome Analysis Reveals Historical Lineages in Yellowstone Bison	PLOS ONE	Yellowstone National Park is home to one of the only plains bison populations that have continuously existed on their present landscape since prehistoric times without evidence of domestic cattle introgression. Previous studies characterized the relatively high levels of nuclear genetic diversity in these bison, but little is known about their mitochondrial haplotype diversity. This study assessed mitochondrial genomes from 25 randomly selected Yellowstone bison and found 10 different mitochondrial haplotypes with a haplotype diversity of 0.78 (+/- 0.06). Spatial analysis of these mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes did not detect geographic population subdivision (F-ST = -0.06, p = 0.76). However, we identified two independent and historically important lineages in Yellowstone bison by combining data from 65 bison (defined by 120 polymorphic sites) from across North America representing a total of 30 different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from one of the Yellowstone lineages represent descendants of the 22 indigenous bison remaining in central Yellowstone in 1902. The other mitochondrial DNA lineage represents descendants of the 18 females introduced from northern Montana in 1902 to supplement the indigenous bison population and develop a new breeding herd in the northern region of the park. Comparing modern and historical mitochondrial DNA diversity in Yellowstone bison helps uncover a historical context of park restoration efforts during the early 1900s, provides evidence against a hypothesized mitochondrial disease in bison, and reveals the signature of recent hybridization between American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and Canadian wood bison (B.b. athabascae). Our study demonstrates how mitochondrial DNA can be applied to delineate the history of wildlife species and inform future conservation actions.	2016	10.1371/journal.pone.0166081		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	just look at haplotypes	FALSE			FALSE	
Galaverni, Marco; Caniglia, Romolo; Pagani, Luca; Fabbri, Elena; Boattini, Alessio; Randi, Ettore	Disentangling Timing of Admixture, Patterns of Introgression, and Phenotypic Indicators in a Hybridizing Wolf Population	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybridization is a natural or anthropogenic process that can deeply affect the genetic make-up of populations, possibly decreasing individual fitness but sometimes favoring local adaptations. The population of Italian wolves (Canis lupus), after protracted demographic declines and isolation, is currently expanding in anthropic areas, with documented cases of hybridization with stray domestic dogs. However, identifying admixture patterns in deeply introgressed populations is far from trivial. In this study, we used a panel of 170,000 SNPs analyzed with multivariate, Bayesian and local ancestry reconstruction methods to identify hybrids, estimate their ancestry proportions and timing since admixture. Moreover, we carried out preliminary genotype-phenotype association analyses to identify the genetic bases of three phenotypic traits (black coat, white claws, and spur on the hind legs) putative indicators of hybridization. Results showed no sharp subdivisions between nonadmixed wolves and hybrids, indicating that recurrent hybridization and deep introgression might have started mostly at the beginning of the population reexpansion. In hybrids, we identified a number of genomic regions with excess of ancestry in one of the parental populations, and regions with excess or resistance to introgression compared with neutral expectations. The three morphological traits showed significant genotype-phenotype associations, with a single genomic region for black coats and white claws, and with multiple genomic regions for the spur. In all cases the associated haplotypes were likely derived from dogs. In conclusion, we show that the use of multiple genome-wide ancestry reconstructions allows clarifying the admixture dynamics even in highly introgressed populations, and supports their conservation management.	2017	10.1093/molbev/msx169		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Garcia-Elfring, A.; Barrett, R. D. H.; Combs, M.; Davies, T. J.; Munshi-South, J.; Millien, V.	Admixture on the northern front: population genomics of range expansion in the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and secondary contact with the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)	HEREDITY	Range expansion has genetic consequences expected to result in differentiated wave-front populations with low genetic variation and potentially introgression from a local species. The northern expansion of Peromyscus leucopus in southern Quebec provides an opportunity to test these predictions using population genomic tools. Our results show evidence of recent and post-glacial expansion. Genome-wide variation in P. leucopus indicates two post-glacial lineages are separated by the St. Lawrence River, with a more recent divergence of populations isolated by the Richelieu River. In two of three transects we documented northern populations with low diversity in at least one genetic measure, although most relationships were not significant. Consistent with bottlenecks and allele surfing during northward expansion, we document a northern-most population with low nucleotide diversity, divergent allele frequencies and the most private alleles, and observed heterozygosity indicates outcrossing. Ancestry proportions revealed putative hybrids of P. leucopus and P. maniculatus. A formal test for gene flow confirmed secondary contact, showing that a reticulate population phylogeny between P. maniculatus and P. leucopus was a better fit to the data than a bifurcating model without gene flow. Thus, we provide the first genomic evidence of gene flow between this pair of species in natural populations. Understanding the evolutionary consequences of secondary contact is an important conservation concern as climate-induced range expansions are expected to result in new hybrid zones between closely related species.	2017	10.1038/hdy.2017.57		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Uses SRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE	FALSE			FALSE

For this purpose, we used molecular markers, both nuclear and mitochondrial, that are indicative for local adaptation as well as neutral markers to elucidate the patterns of population differentiation based on geographic isolation and the clade of origin. To broaden our analysis, we included data from our previous studies concerning mainland populations, to explore the genetic differentiation in the base of the geographic origin (mainland/island) of the populations.ResultsOur results suggest that local adaptation shapes the differentiation in both genomes, favoring specific alleles in nuclear genes (e.g. DQA) or haplotypes in mtDNA (e.g. Control Region, CR). mtDNA variation was found to be in a higher level and was able to give a phylogeographic signal for the populations. Furthermore, the degree of variation was influenced not only by the geographic origin, but also by the clade of origin, since specific island populations of Anatolian origin showed a greater degree of variation compared to specific mainland populations of the European clade. Concerning the hybrid population, we confirmed the existence of both clades in the territory and we provided a possible explanation for the lack of introgression between the clades.ConclusionOur results indicate that the Quaternary's climatic oscillations played a major role in the shaping of the phylogeographic patterns of the species, by isolating populations in the distinct refugia, where they adapted and differentiate in allopatry, leading to genome incompatibilities observed nowadays.	2019	10.1186/s12862-019-1354-y		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate introgression summary stats instead did FST and ADMIXTURE plots (Q values)	FALSE			FALSE

Haines, Margaret L.; Luikart, Gordon; Amish, Stephen J.; Smith, Seth; Latch, Emily K.	Evidence for adaptive introgression of exons across a hybrid swarm in deer	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background Secondary contact between closely related lineages can result in a variety of outcomes, including hybridization, depending upon the strength of reproductive barriers. By examining the extent to which different parts of the genome introgress, it is possible to infer the strength of selection and gain insight into the evolutionary trajectory of lineages. Following secondary contact approximately 8000 years ago in the Pacific Northwest, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) and black-tailed deer (O. h. columbianus) formed a hybrid swarm along the Cascade mountain range despite substantial differences in body size (up to two times) and habitat preference. In this study, we examined genetic population structure, extent of introgression, and selection pressures in freely interbreeding populations of mule deer and black-tailed deer using mitochondrial DNA sequences, 9 microsatellite loci, and 95 SNPs from protein-coding genes. Results We observed bi-directional hybridization and classified approximately one third of the 172 individuals as hybrids, almost all of which were beyond the F1 generation. High genetic differentiation between black-tailed deer and mule deer at protein-coding genes suggests that there is positive divergent selection, though selection on these loci is relatively weak. Contrary to predictions, there was not greater selection on protein-coding genes thought to be associated with immune function and mate choice. Geographic cline analyses were consistent across genetic markers, suggesting long-term stability (over hundreds of generations), and indicated that the center of the hybrid swarm is 20-30 km to the east of the Cascades ridgeline, where there is a steep ecological transition from wet, forested habitat to dry, scrub habitat. Conclusions Our data are consistent with a genetic boundary between mule deer and black-tailed deer that is porous but maintained by many loci under weak selection having a substantial cumulative effect. The absence of clear reproductive barriers and the consistent centering of geographic clines at a sharp ecotone suggests that ecology is a driver of hybrid swarm dynamics. Adaptive introgression in this study (and others) promotes gene flow and provides valuable insight into selection strength on specific genes and the evolutionary trajectory of hybridizing taxa.	2019	10.1186/s12862-019-1497-x		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate introgression summary stats instead did FST, JOST's D, Q, and K	FALSE			FALSE	
Hallstroem, Bjoern M.; Janke, Axel	Resolution among major placental mammal interordinal relationships with genome data imply that speciation influenced their earliest radiations	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Background: A number of the deeper divergences in the placental mammal tree are still inconclusively resolved despite extensive phylogenomic analyses. A recent analysis of 200 kbp of protein coding sequences yielded only limited support for the relationships among Laurasiatheria (cow, dog, bat and shrew), probably because the divergences occurred only within a few million years from each other. It is generally expected that increasing the amount of data and improving the taxon sampling enhance the resolution of narrow divergences. Therefore these and other difficult splits were examined by phylogenomic analysis of the hitherto largest sequence alignment. The increasingly complete genome data of placental mammals also allowed developing a novel and stringent data search method. Results: The rigorous data handling, recursive BLAST, successfully removed the sequences from gene families, including those from well-known families hemoglobin, olfactory, myosin and HOX genes, thus avoiding alignment of possibly paralogous sequences. The current phylogenomic analysis of 3,012 genes (2,844,615 nucleotides) from a total of 22 species yielded statistically significant support for most relationships. While some major clades were confirmed using genomic sequence data, the placement of the treeshrew, bat and the relationship between Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra and Afrotheria remained problematic to resolve despite the size of the alignment. Phylogenomic analysis of divergence times dated the basal placental mammal splits at 95-100 million years ago. Many of the following divergences occurred only a few (2-4) million years later. Relationships with narrow divergence time intervals received unexpectedly limited support even from the phylogenomic analyses. Conclusion: The narrow temporal window within which some placental divergences took place suggests that inconsistencies and limited resolution of the mammalian tree may have their natural explanation in speciation processes such as lineage sorting, introgression from species hybridization or hybrid speciation. These processes obscure phylogenetic analysis, making some parts of the tree difficult to resolve even with genome data.	2008	10.1186/1471-2148-8-162		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	says introgression is a possibility but doesn't actually claim its happening	FALSE			FALSE

Previous mitochondrial studies have revealed a polyphyletic pattern suggesting the possible existence of two distinct species. To assess this issue, we have sequenced 16 nuclear genes and one mitochondrial fragment (cytochrome b gene + control region) for most species of the tribe Tragelaphini, including seven bushbuck individuals belonging to the two divergent mtDNA haplogroups, Scriptus and Sylvaticus. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the Scriptus lineage is a sister-group of Sylvaticus in the nuclear tree, whereas it is related to Tragelaphus angasii in the mitochondrial tree. This mito-nuclear discordance indicates that the mitochondrial genome of Scriptus was acquired by introgression after one or several past events of hybridization between bushbuck and an extinct species closely related to T. angasii. The division into two bushbuck species is supported by the analyses of nuclear markers and by the karyotype here described for T. scriptus (2n = 57 M/58F), which is strikingly distinct from the one previously found for T. sylvaticus (2n = 33 M/34F). Molecular dating estimates suggest that the two species separated during the Early Pleistocene after an event of interspecific hybridization, which may have mediated massive chromosomal rearrangements in the common ancestor of T. scriptus.	2018	10.1016/j.ympev.2018.08.006		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Hassanin, Alexandre; Ropiquet, Anne	Resolving a zoological mystery: the kouprey is a real species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	The kouprey is a rare and enigmatic forest ox discovered by scientists in Cambodia only in 1937. Numerous morphological hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the kouprey: that it is a species closely related to banteng and gaur, two other wild oxen of southeast Asia; a morphologically divergent species placed in a separate genus, named Novibos; a wild species linked to aurochs and domestic cattle; a vicariant population of banteng; a feral cattle; or a hybrid of banteng with either zebu cattle, gaur or water buffalo. In a recent paper, which gained a lot of media coverage, Galbreath et al. analysed mitochondrial DNA sequences and concluded that the kouprey never existed as a wild, natural species, and that it was a feral hybrid between banteng and zebu cattle. Here we analyse eight DNA markers-three mitochondrial regions and five nuclear fragments - representing an alignment of 4582 nucleotides for the holotype of the kouprey and all related species. Our results demonstrate that the kouprey is a real and naturally occurring species, and show that Cambodian populations of banteng acquired a mitochondrial genome of kouprey by natural introgressive hybridization during the Pleistocene epoch.	2007	10.1098/rspb.2007.0830		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	doesn't actually claim there is introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Population Genomic Analysis of North American Eastern Wolves (Canis lycaon) Supports Their Conservation Priority Status	GENES	The threatened eastern wolf is found predominantly in protected areas of central Ontario and has an evolutionary history obscured by interbreeding with coyotes and gray wolves, which challenges its conservation status and subsequent management. Here, we used a population genomics approach to uncover spatial patterns of variation in 281 canids in central Ontario and the Great Lakes region. This represents the first genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset with substantial sample sizes of representative populations. Although they comprise their own genetic cluster, we found evidence of eastern wolf dispersal outside of the boundaries of protected areas, in that the frequency of eastern wolf genetic variation decreases with increasing distance from provincial parks. We detected eastern wolf alleles in admixed coyotes along the northeastern regions of Lake Huron and Lake Ontario. Our analyses confirm the unique genomic composition of eastern wolves, which are mostly restricted to small fragmented patches of protected habitat in central Ontario. We hope this work will encourage an innovative discussion regarding a plan for managed introgression, which could conserve eastern wolf genetic material in any genome regardless of their potential mosaic ancestry composition and the habitats that promote them.	2018	10.3390/genes9120606		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

This increase raises concerns due to wild boar impact on crops and natural ecosystems and as potential vector of diseases. Additionally, wild boar can hybridize with domestic pigs, which could increase health risks and alter wild boar adaptive potential. We analysed 47,148 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in wild boar from Europe (292) and the Near East (16), and commercial (44) and local (255) pig breeds, to discern patterns of hybridization across Europe. We identified 33 wild boars with more than 10% domestic ancestry in their genome, mostly concentrated in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Serbia. This difference is probably due to contrasting practices, with free-ranging vs. industrial farming but more samples would be needed to investigate larger geographic patterns. Our results suggest hybridization has occurred over a long period and is still ongoing, as we observed recent hybrids. Although wild and domestic populations have maintained their genetic distinctiveness, potential health threats raise concerns and require implementation of management actions and farming practices aimed at reducing contact between wild and domestic pigs.	2018	10.1038/s41598-018-35865-8		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

M. m. domesticus is the more widespread of the two subspecies, occupying the western and southern coast of Norway, while M. m. musculus is found along Norway's southeastern coast and east from there to Sweden. Two sections of the hybrid zone between the two subspecies were localized in Norway. However, hybrid forms also occur well away from that hybrid zone, the most prevalent of which are mice with a M. m. musculus-type Y chromosome and an otherwise M. m. domesticus genome. MtDNA D-loop sequences of the mice revealed a complex phylogeography within M. m. domesticus, reflecting passive human transport to Norway, probably during the Viking period. M. m. musculus may have colonized earlier. If so, that leaves open the possibility that M. m. domesticus replaced M. m. musculus from much of Norway, with the widely distributed hybrids a relict of this process. Overall, the effects of hybridization are evident in house mice throughout Norway.	2010	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04874.x		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	just on mtDNA	FALSE			FALSE	
Juric, Ivan; Aeschbacher, Simon; Coop, Graham	The Strength of Selection against Neanderthal Introgression	PLOS GENETICS	Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans. After hybridization, on average, selection appears to have removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. Quantifying the strength and causes of this selection against Neanderthal ancestry is key to understanding our relationship to Neanderthals and, more broadly, how populations remain distinct after secondary contact. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral D and segregating at high frequency D in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.	2016	10.1371/journal.pgen.1006340		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	looking at selection against introgression not introgression itsel	FALSE			FALSE	
La Morgia, Valentina; Venturino, Ezio	Understanding hybridization and competition processes between hare species: Implications for conservation and management on the basis of a mathematical model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING	Hybridization and introgression frequently occur in animal communities, both in nature or caused by human actions. In the genus Lepus (Mammals, Lagomorphs) genetic mixing has been widely documented and it probably affected the population dynamics of species, particularly during climatic oscillations. We thus propose and investigate a mathematical model, with the aim to describe and predict the outcome of interspecific interactions in a three-population system including European (Lepus europaeus), mountain (Lepus timidus) and hybrid hares.& para;& para;Our results show that the three-population system can survive at a stable level, but equilibria involving only parental species could also be feasible. This implies that, depending on initial conditions, the mountain hare could suffer from the competition with European and hybrid hares and its population could disappear in the near future. Under climate change scenarios, the conditions for coexistence will become even more restrictive, mountain hare populations could be depressed and finally collapse.& para;& para;Thus, at present the hybridization phenomenon does not necessarily represent a threat to the conservation of the unique genomes of the parental species, but climate change and human intervention, namely the introduction of European hares in the range of the Alpine mountain species, could result in an increase in the contact zones between populations, finally promoting hybridization and biotic homogenization.

The Evolution of Polymorphic Hybrid Incompatibilities in House Mice	GENETICS	Resolving the mechanistic and genetic bases of reproductive barriers between species is essential to understanding the evolutionary forces that shape speciation. Intrinsic hybrid incompatibilities are often treated as fixed between species, yet there can be considerable variation in the strength of reproductive isolation between populations. The extent and causes of this variation remain poorly understood in most systems. We investigated the genetic basis of variable hybrid male sterility (HMS) between two recently diverged subspecies of house mice, Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus. We found that polymorphic HMS has a surprisingly complex genetic basis, with contributions from at least five autosomal loci segregating between two closely related wild-derived strains of M. m. musculus. One of the HMS-linked regions on chromosome 4 also showed extensive introgression among inbred laboratory strains and transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in hybrid crosses. Using additional crosses and whole genome sequencing of sperm pools, we showed that TRD was limited to hybrid crosses and was not due to differences in sperm motility between M. m. musculus strains. Based on these results, we argue that TRD likely reflects additional incompatibilities that reduce hybrid embryonic viability. In some common inbred strains of mice, selection against deleterious interactions appears to have unexpectedly driven introgression at loci involved in epistatic hybrid incompatibilities. The highly variable genetic basis to F1 hybrid incompatibilities between closely related mouse lineages argues that a thorough dissection of reproductive isolation will require much more extensive sampling of natural variation than has been commonly utilized in mice and other model systems.	2018	10.1534/genetics.118.300840		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Doesn't actually report D values but mentions a genome wide averge 	FALSE			FALSE	
Lin, Dana; Bi, Ke; Conroy, Christopher J.; Lacey, Eileen A.; Schraiber, Joshua G.; Bowie, Rauri C. K.	Mito-nuclear discordance across a recent contact zone for California voles	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	To examine the processes that maintain genetic diversity among closely related taxa, we investigated the dynamics of introgression across a contact zone between two lineages of California voles (Microtus californicus). We tested the prediction that introgression of nuclear loci would be greater than that for mitochondrial loci, assuming ongoing gene flow across the contact zone. We also predicted that genomic markers would show a mosaic pattern of differentiation across this zone, consistent with genomes that are semi-permeable. Using mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences and genome-wide loci developed via ddRAD-seq, we analyzed genetic variation for 10 vole populations distributed along the central California coast; this transect included populations from within the distributions of both parental lineages as well as the putative contact zone. Our analyses revealed that (1) the two lineages examined are relatively young, having diverged ca.8.5-54kya, (2) voles from the contact zone in Santa Barbara County did not include F1 or early generation backcrossed individuals, and (3) there appeared to be little to no recurrent gene flow across the contact zone. Introgression patterns for mitochondrial and nuclear markers were not concordant; only mitochondrial markers revealed evidence of introgression, putatively due to historical hybridization. These differences in genetic signatures are intriguing given that the contact zone occurs in a region of continuous vole habitat, with no evidence of past or present physical barriers. Future studies that examine specific isolating mechanisms, such as microhabitat use and mate choice, will facilitate our understanding of how genetic boundaries are maintained in this system.	2018	10.1002/ece3.4129		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

Mao, Xiuguang; Tsagkogeorga, Georgia; Bailey, Sebastian E.; Rossiter, Stephen J.	Genomics of introgression in the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) revealed by transcriptome sequencing	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Recent genomic studies show that introgression can occur at a genome-wide scale among recently diverged lineages. However, introgression is difficult to distinguish from incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and these processes are expected to occur together. Moreover, ncDNA introgression is less easily detected than mtDNA introgression, and as such its prevalence is less well understood. The Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) occurs as three distinct forms on mainland China: the subspecies R. s. septentrionalis and two parapatric clades of R. s. sinicus (Central and East R. s. sinicus). Previous work suggested widespread mtDNA introgression between these subspecies; however, no ncDNA introgression was detected. In this study we sampled the coding genomes of all three forms of R. sinicus in order to perform a more sensitive test for ncDNA introgression against an expected background of ILS. We assembled 3548 nuclear protein-coding genes from these and three congeneric species, and built a high-confidence species tree using maximum likelihood and Bayesian concordance methods. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a mosaic genome for Central R. s. sinicus derived from R. s. septentrionalis and East R. s. sinicus. Nuclear DNA introgression between Central R. s. sinicus and R. s. septentrionalis was supported by three different tests, whereas ILS could not be ruled out completely. Our findings, in line with other recent results, indicate that recently diverged taxa undergo large-scale secondary introgression, and that this process likely operates alongside ILS to give rise to phylogenomic discordances or even mosaic genomes.	2017	10.1093/biolinnean/blx017		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Martincova, Iva; Dureje, Ludovit; Kreisinger, Jakub; Macholan, Milos; Pialek, Jaroslav	Phenotypic effects of the Y chromosome are variable and structured in hybrids among house mouse recombinant lines	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybrid zones between divergent populations sieve genomes into blocks that introgress across the zone, and blocks that do not, depending on selection between interacting genes. Consistent with Haldane's rule, the Y chromosome has been considered counterselected and hence not to introgress across the European house mouse hybrid zone. However, recent studies detected massive invasion of M. m. musculus Y chromosomes into M. m. domesticus territory. To understand mechanisms facilitating Y spread, we created 31 recombinant lines from eight wild-derived strains representing four localities within the two mouse subspecies. These lines were reciprocally crossed and resulting F1 hybrid males scored for five phenotypic traits associated with male fitness. Molecular analyses of 51 Y-linked SNPs attributed 50% of genetic variation to differences between the subspecies and 8% to differentiation within both taxa. A striking proportion, 21% (frequencies of sperm head abnormalities) and 42% (frequencies of sperm tail dissociations), of phenotypic variation was explained by geographic Y chromosome variants. Our crossing design allowed this explanatory power to be examined across a hierarchical scale from subspecific to local intrastrain effects. We found that divergence and variation were expressed diversely in different phenotypic traits and varied across the whole hierarchical scale. This finding adds another dimension of complexity to studies of Y introgression not only across the house mouse hybrid zone but potentially also in other contact zones.	2019	10.1002/ece3.5196		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Identifying pure wildcats and investigating the ancestry of admixed individuals becomes thus a conservation priority. We analyzed 63k cat Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) with multivariate, Bayesian and gene-search tools to better evaluate admixture levels between domestic and wild cats collected in Europe, timing and ancestry proportions of their hybrids and backcrosses, and track the origin (wild or domestic) of the genomic blocks carried by admixed cats, also looking for possible deviations from neutrality in their inheritance patterns. Small domestic ancestry blocks were detected in the genomes of most admixed cats, which likely originated from hybridization events occurring from 6 to 22 generations in the past. We identified about 1,900 outlier coding genes with excess of wild or domestic ancestry compared to random expectations in the admixed individuals. More than 600 outlier genes were significantly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) categories mainly related to social behavior, functional and metabolic adaptive processes (wild-like genes), involved in cognition and neural crest development (domestic-like genes), or associated with immune system functions and lipid metabolism (parental-like genes). These kinds of genomic ancestry analyses could be reliably applied to unravel the admixture dynamics in European wildcats, as well as in other hybridizing populations, in order to design more efficient conservation plans.	2019	10.1038/s41598-019-48002-w		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate introgression summary stats instead did FST and ADMIXTURE plots (Q values)	FALSE			FALSE

Increased genetic marker density reveals high levels of admixture between red deer and introduced Japanese sika in Kintyre, Scotland	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Hybridization is a natural process at species range boundaries, but increasing numbers of species are hybridizing due to direct or indirect human activities. In such cases of anthropogenic hybridization, subsequent introgression can threaten the survival of native species. To date, many such systems have been studied with too few genetic markers to assess the level of threat resulting from advanced backcrossing. Here, we use 44,999 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the ADMIXTURE program to study two areas of Scotland where a panel of 22 diagnostic microsatellites previously identified introgression between native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and introduced Japanese sika (Cervus nippon). In Kintyre, we reclassify 26% of deer from the pure species categories to the hybrid category whereas in the NW Highlands we only reclassify 2%. As expected, the reclassified individuals are mostly advanced backcrosses. We also investigate the ability of marker panels selected on different posterior allele frequency criteria to find hybrids assigned by the full marker set and show that in our data, ancestry informative markers (i.e. those that are highly differentiated between the species, but not fixed) are better than diagnostic markers (those markers that are fixed between the species) because they are more evenly distributed in the genome. Diagnostic loci are concentrated on the X chromosome to the detriment of autosomal coverage.	2020	10.1111/eva.12880		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate introgression summary stats instead did FST and ADMIXTURE plots (Q values)	FALSE			FALSE

At lower elevations, it is common to hybridize yaks with cattle to combine the yak's hardiness with the productivity of cattle. Hybrid males are sterile, however, preventing the establishment of stable hybrid populations, but not a limited introgression after backcrossing several generations of female hybrids to male yaks. Here we inferred bovine haplotypes in the genomes of 76 Mongolian yaks using high-density SNP genotyping and whole-genome sequencing. These yaks inherited similar to 1.3% of their genome from bovine ancestors after nearly continuous admixture over at least the last 1,500 years. The introgressed regions are enriched in genes involved in nervous system development and function, and particularly in glutamate metabolism and neurotransmission. We also identified a novel mutation associated with a polled (hornless) phenotype originating from Mongolian Turano cattle. Our results suggest that introgressive hybridization contributed to the improvement of yak management and breeding.	2017	10.1038/ng.3775		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

Widespread, long-term admixture between grey wolves and domestic dogs across Eurasia and its implications for the conservation status of hybrids	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Hybridisation between a domesticated species and its wild ancestor is an important conservation problem, especially if it results in the introgression of domestic gene variants into wild species. Nevertheless, the legal status of hybrids remains unregulated, partially because of the limited understanding of the hybridisation process and its consequences. The occurrence of hybridisation between grey wolves and domestic dogs is well documented from different parts of the wolf geographic range, but little is known about the frequency of hybridisation events, their causes and the genetic impact on wolf populations. We analysed 61K SNPs spanning the canid genome in wolves from across Eurasia and North America and compared that data to similar data from dogs to identify signatures of admixture. The haplotype block analysis, which included 38 autosomes and the X chromosome, indicated the presence of individuals of mixed wolf-dog ancestry in most Eurasian wolf populations, but less admixture was present in North American populations. We found evidence for male-biased introgression of dog alleles into wolf populations, but also identified a first-generation hybrid resulting from mating between a female dog and a male wolf. We found small blocks of dog ancestry in the genomes of 62% Eurasian wolves studied and melanistic individuals with no signs of recent admixed ancestry, but with a dog-derived allele at a locus linked to melanism. Consequently, these results suggest that hybridisation has been occurring in different parts of Eurasia on multiple timescales and is not solely a recent phenomenon. Nevertheless, wolf populations have maintained genetic differentiation from dogs, suggesting that hybridisation at a low frequency does not diminish distinctiveness of the wolf gene pool. However, increased hybridisation frequency may be detrimental for wolf populations, stressing the need for genetic monitoring to assess the frequency and distribution of individuals resulting from recent admixture.	2018	10.1111/eva.12595		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Uses SRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE	FALSE			FALSE

In this continuum, naturally hybridizing taxa provide a promising avenue for revealing the genetic changes associated with the incipient stages of speciation. To identify such changes between two subspecies of rabbits that display partial reproductive isolation, we studied patterns of allele frequency change across their hybrid zone using whole-genome sequencing. To connect levels and patterns of genetic differentiation with phenotypic manifestations of subfertility in hybrid rabbits, we further investigated patterns of gene expression in testis. Geographic cline analysis revealed 253 regions characterized by steep changes in allele frequency across their natural region of contact. This catalog of regions is likely to be enriched for loci implicated in reproductive barriers and yielded several insights into the evolution of hybrid dysfunction in rabbits: (i) incomplete reproductive isolation is likely governed by the effects of many loci, (ii) protein-protein interaction analysis suggest that genes within these loci interact more than expected by chance, (iii) regulatory variation is likely the primary driver of incompatibilities, and (iv) large chromosomal rearrangements appear not to be a major mechanism underlying incompatibilities or promoting isolation in the face of gene flow. We detected extensive misregulation of gene expression in testis of hybrid males, but not a statistical overrepresentation of differentially expressed genes in candidate regions. Our results also did not support an X chromosome-wide disruption of expression as observed in mice and cats, suggesting variation in the mechanistic basis of hybrid male reduced fertility among mammals.	2018	10.1111/mec.14494		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

Baboons (genus Papio) are Old World monkeys consisting of six readily distinguishable species. Baboon species hybridize in the wild, and prior data imply a complex history of differentiation and introgression. We produced a reference genome assembly for the olive baboon (Papio anubis) and whole-genome sequence data for all six extant species. We document multiple episodes of admixture and introgression during the radiation of Papio baboons, thus demonstrating their value as a model of complex evolutionary divergence, hybridization, and reticulation. These results help inform our understanding of similar cases, including modern humans, Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other ancient hominins.	2019	10.1126/sciadv.aau6947		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

Roos, Christian; Liedigk, Rasmus; Van Ngoc Thinh; Nadler, Tilo; Zinner, Dietmar	The Hybrid Origin of the Indochinese Gray Langur Trachypithecus crepusculus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY	Hybridization among formerly separated lineages is a common phenomenon in almost all groups of organisms, including primates. Indicators of hybridization include discordant phylogenies derived from different genetic markers or from genetic and phenotypic characters. Such conflicting phylogenies have been reported for the Indochinese gray langur, Trachypithecus crepusculus. To further investigate the evolutionary history of this species, we analyzed complete mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes and 12 nuclear loci from several representatives of all four Trachypithecus species groups. Our nuclear DNA (nucDNA) phylogeny agreed with the external appearance of the groups: T. crepusculus clustered with the T. obscurus group, as sister to T. barbei. In contrast, mtDNA data suggested T. crepusculus is sister to the T. francoisi group. Coalescent-based methods favored hybridization as the main reason for the observed gene tree discordance and dated the divergence of T. crepusculus from the T. francoisi group (mtDNA) at ca. 2.45 million years ago (Ma) and from T. barbei (nucDNA) at ca. 0.36Ma. We hypothesize that the most likely explanation for the observed pattern is male-mediated gene flow from T. barbei into an ancestral form of T. crepusculus, followed by nuclear swamping. This predicts that the nuclear genome of T. crepusculus might be highly similar to that of T. barbei, while the original mtDNA genome was retained as a relict of an otherwise extinct species. Our study provides further data about the putative hybrid status of a colobine taxon and highlights the need for multilocus analyses in phylogenetics.	2019	10.1007/s10764-017-0008-4		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE

Diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism markers to identify hybridization between dromedary and Bactrian camels	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES	The technique to produce hybrid Tulu or Nar camels from crosses between dromedary and Bactrian camels is common throughout Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries. Formerly, these hybrids were highly valued as strong and persistent pack animals but today are bred to improve milk or wool quality in the respective species and for camel wrestling. We developed a diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel to identify cryptic ancestry in F-1 hybrids and their backcrosses by selecting loci from whole genome data, which were fixed for different alleles in either dromedary or domestic and wild Bactrian camel. With this SNP panel we are able to identify the hybridization patterns in camels with uncertain origins, support hybrid breeding management and to detect potential rare dromedary introgression in the last wild Bactrian camels in Mongolia and China.	2015	10.1007/s12686-015-0420-z		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Russell, Ty; Cullingham, Catherine; Kommadath, Arun; Stothard, Paul; Herbst, Allen; Coltman, David	Development of a Novel Mule Deer Genomic Assembly and Species-Diagnostic SNP Panel for Assessing Introgression in Mule Deer, White-Tailed Deer, and Their Interspecific Hybrids	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are endemic to a wide variety of habitats in western North America, many of which are shared in sympatry with their closely related sister-species white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), whom they hybridize with in wild populations. Although mule deer meet many ideal conditions for a molecular ecological research species, such as high abundance, ecological importance, and broad dispersal and gene flow, conservation genetic studies have been limited by a relative lack of existing genomic resources and inherent difficulties caused by introgression with white-tailed deer. Many molecular tools currently available for the study of cervids were designed using reference assemblies of divergent model species, specifically cattle (Bos taurus). Bovidae and Cervidae diverged approximately 28 million years ago, therefore, we sought to ameliorate the available resources by contributing the first mule deer whole genome sequence draft assembly with an average genome-wide read depth of 25X, using the white-tailed genome assembly (Ovir.te_1.0) as a reference. Comparing the two assemblies, we identified similar to 33 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion variants. We then verified fixed SNP differences between the two species and developed a 40-loci SNP assay capable of identifying pure mule deer, white-tailed deer, and interspecific hybrids. Assignment capacity of the panel, which was tested on simulated datasets, is reliable up to and including the third backcross hybrid generation. Identification of post-F1 hybrids will be necessary for hybrid zone population studies going forward, and the new mule deer assembly will be a valuable resource for genetic and comparative genomics studies.	2019	10.1534/g3.118.200838		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Salviano, Mauricio Barbosa; Cursino, Marina Suzuki; Zanetti, Eveline dos Santos; Abril, Vanessa Veltrini; Barbanti Duarte, Jose Mauricio	Intraspecific chromosome polymorphisms can lead to reproductive isolation and speciation: an example in red brocket deer (Mazama americana)	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION	The red brocket (Mazama americana) is a South American deer with a wide geographical distribution that presents different chromosomal variants depending on their location. At least six different cytotypes belonging to two distinct evolutionary lineages have been described. This study aimed to verify the existence of postzygotic reproductive isolation between cytotypes of M. americana by comparative evaluation of pure and hybrid males. Seven 18-month-old bucks were submitted to seminal collection and evaluation and testicle histological evaluations. The pure males showed normal parameters for sperm quality and testicular histology. Hybrids from the same evolutionary lineage (<= 3 chromosomes different from the progenitors) showed similar results to pure males, except for the reduced ratio of round spermatids to pachytene spermatocytes. Hybrids between cytotypes of different evolutionary lineages (>= 10 chromosomes different from progenitors) presented azoospermia and evidence of testicular degeneration. Despite the striking morphological similarities, we can conclude that populations with more distinct karyotypes possess an effective reproductive barrier; moreover, there is evidence that reproductive isolation mechanisms exist between some closer karyotypes, corroborating the hypothesis that M. americana is best characterized as a superspecies. Thus, the future description of several new species for this taxon is expected, since the tendency is to establish efficient mechanisms of postzygotic reproductive isolation, preventing the introgression and fusion of genomes from different populations through chromosome variation. Summary Sentence Differences equal to or greater than seven chromosomes produce an effective reproductive isolation between red brocket deer cytotypes and a depression in fertility occurs among karyotypes with at least two chromosome diferences.	2017	10.1093/biolre/iox041		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	Just deer sperm	FALSE			FALSE

Seixas, Fernando A.; Boursot, Pierre; Melo-Ferreira, Jose	The genomic impact of historical hybridization with massive mitochondria DNA introgression	GENOME BIOLOGY	Background: The extent to which selection determines interspecific patterns of genetic exchange enlightens the role of adaptation in evolution and speciation. Often reported extensive interspecific introgression could be selection-driven, but also result from demographic processes, especially in cases of invasive species replacements, which can promote introgression at their invasion front. Because invasion and selective sweeps similarly mold variation, population genetics evidence for selection can only be gathered in an explicit demographic framework The Iberian hare, Lepus granatensis, displays in its northern range extensive mitochondrial DNA introgression from L timidus, an arctic/boreal species that it replaced locally after the last glacial maximum. We use whole-genome sequencing to infer geographic and genomic patterns of nuclear introgression and fit a neutral model of species replacement with hybridization, allowing us to evaluate how selection influenced introgression genome-wide, including for mtDNA. Results: Although the average nuclear and mtDNA introgression patterns contrast strongly, they fit a single demographic model of post-glacial invasive replacement of timidus by granatensis. Outliers of elevated introgression include several genes related to immunity, spermatogenesis, and mitochondrial metabolism. Introgression is reduced on the X chromosome and in low recombining regions. Conclusions: General nuclear and mtDNA patterns of introgression can be explained by purely demographic processes. Hybrid incompatibilities and interplay between selection and recombination locally modulate levels of nuclear introgression. Selection promoted introgression of some genes involved in conflicts, either interspecific (parasites) or possibly cytonuclear. In the latter case, nuclear introgression could mitigate the potential negative effects of alien mtDNA on mitochondrial metabolism and male-specific traits.	2018	10.1186/s13059-018-1471-8		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Sharbrough, Joel; Havird, Justin C.; Noe, Gregory R.; Warren, Jessica M.; Sloan, Daniel B.	The Mitonuclear Dimension of Neanderthal and Denisovan Ancestry in Modern Human Genomes	GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Some human populations interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans, resulting in substantial contributions to modern-human genomes. Therefore, it is now possible to use genomic data to investigate mechanisms that shaped historical gene flow between humans and our closest hominin relatives. More generally, in eukaryotes, mitonuclear interactions have been argued to play a disproportionate role in generating reproductive isolation. There is no evidence of mtDNA introgression into modern human populations, which means that all introgressed nuclear alleles from archaic hominins must function on a modern-human mitochondrial background. Therefore, mitonuclear interactions are also potentially relevant to hominin evolution. We performed a detailed accounting of mtDNA divergence among hominin lineages and used population-genomic data to test the hypothesis that mitonuclear incompatibilities have preferentially restricted the introgression of nuclear genes with mitochondrial functions. We found a small but significant underrepresentation of introgressed Neanderthal alleles at such nuclear loci. Structural analyses of mitochondrial enzyme complexes revealed that these effects are unlikely to be mediated by physically interacting sites in mitochondrial and nuclear gene products. We did not detect any underrepresentation of introgressed Denisovan alleles at mitochondrial-targeted loci, but this may reflect reduced power because locus-specific estimates of Denisovan introgression are more conservative. Overall, we conclude that genes involved in mitochondrial function may have been subject to distinct selection pressures during the history of introgression from archaic hominins but that mitonuclear incompatibilities have had, at most, a small role in shaping genome-wide introgression patterns, perhaps because of limited functional divergence in mtDNA and interacting nuclear genes.	2017	10.1093/gbe/evx114		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	looked at introgression scores	FALSE			FALSE

To better understand the genomic architecture and adaptive capabilities of this unique domesticated hybrid, we performed whole genome resequencing and compared the genomic architecture and variation of the Dzo to its progenitors: the cattle and Yak. In total, 33.17 M single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were detected between the Dzo and cattle reference genomes. Even though the Dzo is known to be sterile, no genetic signatures associated with sterility were found on the Dzo Y chromosome. On the contrary, our results suggest that the autosomal DMC1 locus (Chromosome 5. 110729098. C>CT) plays a role in the sterility of Dzo, which warrants further exploration of its functions. We integrated the whole genome resequencing data of cattle and Yak to obtain candidate genes with a high degree of variation that might be associated with altitudinal adaptation. We found that the EPAS1 gene, which encodes hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha, exhibited significant variation (Chromosome 11.28664187 C>T) between Yak and cattle, and may play a key role in the genetic basis of altitudinal adaptation. In addition, in analyzing differences between the Dzo, Yak, and cattle genomes, we uncovered several additional genomic signatures relevant to high altitude adaptation and meat and milk production. These findings underscore the need for further studies to improve ruminant stock for sustainable agriculture on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau..	2018	10.9775/kvfd.2018.20022		Mammals			TRUE	FALSE	Did not calculate stats of intrerest 	FALSE			FALSE	
Zinner, Dietmar; Arnold, Michael L.; Roos, Christian	Is the New Primate Genus Rungwecebus a Baboon?	PLOS ONE	Background: In 2005, a new primate species from Tanzania, the kipunji, was described and recognized as a member of the mangabey genus Lophocebus. However, molecular investigations based upon a number of papionins, including a limited sample of baboons of mainly unknown geographic origin, identified the kipunji as a sister taxon to Papio and not as a member of Lophocebus. Accordingly, the kipunji was separated into its own monotypic genus, Rungwecebus. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compare available mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data from the voucher specimen of Rungwecebus to other papionin lineages, including a set of geographically proximal (parapatric) baboon samples. Based on mitochondrial sequence data the kipunji clusters with baboon lineages that lie nearest to it geographically, i.e. populations of yellow and chacma baboons from south-eastern Africa, and thus does not represent a sister taxon to Papio. Nuclear data support a Papio+Rungwecebus clade, but it remains questionable whether Rungwecebus represents a sister taxon to Papio, or whether it is nested within the genus as depicted by the mitochondrial phylogeny. Conclusions/Significance: Our study clearly supports a close relationship between Rungwecebus and Papio and might indicate that the kipunji is congeneric with baboon species. However, due to its morphological and ecological uniqueness Rungwecebus more likely represents a sister lineage to Papio and experienced later introgressive hybridization. Presumably, male (proto-)kipunjis reproduced with sympatric female baboons. Subsequent backcrossing of the hybrids with kipunjis would have resulted in a population with a nuclear kipunji genome, but which retained the yellow/chacma baboon mitochondrial genome. Since only one kipunji specimen was studied, it remains unclear whether all members of the new genus have been impacted by intergeneric introgression or rather only some populations. Further studies with additional Rungwecebus samples are necessary to elucidate the complete evolutionary history of this newly-described primate genus.	2009	10.1371/journal.pone.0004859		Mammals			TRUE	TRUE	doesn't actually claim there is introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Hassanin, Alexandre; An, Junghwa; Ropiquet, Anne; Trung Thanh Nguyen; Couloux, Arnaud	Combining multiple autosomal introns for studying shallow phylogeny and taxonomy of Laurasiatherian mammals: Application to the tribe Bovini (Cetartiodactyla, Bovidae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Mitochondrial sequences are widely used for species identification and for studying phylogenetic relationships among closely related species or populations of the same species. However, many studies of mammals have shown that the maternal history of the mitochondrial genome can be discordant with the true evolutionary history of the taxa. In such cases, the analyses of multiple nuclear genes can be more powerful for deciphering interspecific relationships. Here, we designed primers for amplifying 13 new exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) autosomal loci for studying shallow phylogeny and taxonomy of Laurasiatherian mammals. Three criteria were used for the selection of the markers: gene orthology, a PCR product length between 600 and 1200 nucleotides, and different chromosomal locations in the bovine genome. Positive PCRs were obtained from different species representing the orders Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Chiroptera, Perissodactyla and Pholidota. The newly developed markers were analyzed in a phylogenetic study of the tribe Bovini (the group containing domestic and wild cattle, bison, yak, African buffalo, Asian buffalo, and saola) based on 17 taxa and 18 nuclear genes, representing a total alignment of 13,095 nucleotides. The phylogenetic results were compared to those obtained from analyses of the complete mitochondrial genome and Y chromosomal genes. Our analyses support a basal divergence of the saola (Pseudoryx) and a sister-group relationship between yak and bison. These results contrast with recent molecular studies but are in better agreement with morphology. The comparison of pairwise nucleotide distances shows that our nuDNA dataset provides a good signal for identifying taxonomic levels, such as species, genera, subtribes, tribes and subfamilies, whereas the mtDNA genome fails because of mtDNA introgression and higher levels of homoplasy. Accordingly, we conclude that the genus Bison should be regarded as a synonym of Bos, with the European bison relegated to a subspecies rank within Bos bison. We compared our molecular dating estimates to the fossil record in order to propose. a biogeographic scenario for the evolution of Bovini during the Neogene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Gompert, Zachariah; Buerkle, C. Alex	Analyses of genetic ancestry enable key insights for molecular ecology	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Gene flow and recombination in admixed populations produce genomes that are mosaic combinations of chromosome segments inherited from different source populations, that is, chromosome segments with different genetic ancestries. The statistical problem of estimating genetic ancestry from DNA sequence data has been widely studied, and analyses of genetic ancestry have facilitated research in molecular ecology and ecological genetics. In this review, we describe and compare different model-based statistical methods used to infer genetic ancestry. We describe the conceptual and mathematical structure of these models and highlight some of their key differences and shared features. We then discuss recent empirical studies that use estimates of genetic ancestry to analyse population histories, the nature and genetic basis of species boundaries, and the genetic architecture of traits. These diverse studies demonstrate the breadth of applications that rely on genetic ancestry estimates and typify the genomics-enabled research that is becoming increasingly common in molecular ecology. We conclude by identifying key research areas where future studies might further advance this field.	2013	10.1111/mec.12488		Meta-analysis			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Folk, Ryan A.; Soltis, Pamela S.; Soltis, Douglas E.; Guralnick, Robert	New prospects in the detection and comparative analysis of hybridization in the tree of life	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Assessing the relative importance of the various pathways to diversification is a central goal of biodiversity researchers. For plant biologists, and increasingly across the spectrum of biological sciences, among these pathways of interest is hybridization. New methodological developments are moving the field away from questions of whether natural hybridization occurs or hybrids can persist and toward more direct assessments of the long-term impact of hybridization on diversification and genome organization. Advances in theory and new data, especially phylogenomic data, have changed the face of this field, revealing extensive occurrences of hybridization at both shallow and deep levels, but lacking is a synthesis of these advancements. Here we provide an overview of methods that have been proposed for detecting hybridization with molecular data and advocate a time-extended, comparative view of reticulate evolution. In particular, we pose three overarching questions, newly placed within reach, that are critical for advancing our understanding of hybridization pattern and process: (1) How often is introgression biased toward certain genomes and loci, and is this bias selectively neutral? (2) What are the relative rates of formation of hybrid species and introgressants, and how does this compare to their subsequent fates? (3) Has the frequency of hybridization increased under historical periods of greater dynamism in climate and geographic range, such as the Pleistocene?	2018	10.1002/ajb2.1018		meta-analysis in plants (seems quite relevant)			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Mitchell, Nora; Campbell, Lesley G.; Ahern, Jeffrey R.; Paine, Kellen C.; Giroldo, Aelton B.; Whitney, Kenneth D.	Correlates of hybridization in plants	EVOLUTION LETTERS	Hybridization is a biological phenomenon increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary process in both plants and animals, as it is linked to speciation, radiation, extinction, range expansion and invasion, and allows for increased trait diversity in agricultural and horticultural systems. Estimates of hybridization frequency vary across taxonomic groups, but causes of this variation are unknown. Here, we ask on a global scale whether hybridization is linked to any of 11 traits related to plant life history, reproduction, genetic predisposition, and environment or opportunity. Given that hybridization is not evenly distributed across the plant tree of life, we use phylogenetic generalized least squares regression models and phylogenetic path analysis to detect statistical associations between hybridization and plant traits at both the family and genus levels. We find that perenniality and woodiness are each weakly associated with an increased frequency of hybridization in univariate analyses, but path analysis suggests that the direct linkage is between perenniality and increased hybridization (with woodiness having only an indirect relationship with hybridization via perenniality). Weak associations between higher rates of hybridization and higher outcrossing rates, abiotic pollination syndromes, vegetative reproductive modes, larger genomes, and less variable genome sizes are detectable in some cases but not others. We argue that correlational evidence at the global scale, such as that presented here, provides a robust framework for forming hypotheses to examine and test drivers of hybridization at a more mechanistic level.		10.1002/evl3.146		meta-analysis in plants (seems quite relevant)			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Balao, Francisco; Luis Garcia-Castano, Juan	AFLPsim: an R package to simulate and detect dominant markers under selection in hybridizing populations	PLANT METHODS	Background: In spite of a large diversity of approaches to investigate loci under selection from a population genetic perspective, very few programs have been specifically designed to date to test selection in hybrids using dominant markers. In addition, simulators of dominant markers are very scarce and they do not usually take into account hybridization. Results: Here, we present a new, multifunctional, R package for dominant genetic markers, AFLPsim. This package can simulate dominant markers in hybridizing populations and implements genome scan methods for detecting outlier dominant loci in hybrids. In addition, it includes tools for further manipulating the results, plotting them and other tasks. We describe and tabulate the major functions implemented in AFLPsim. In addition, we provide some demonstration of its use and we perform a comparative study with other software. Finally, we conclude by briefly describing the input and output formats. Conclusions: The R package AFLPsim application provides several useful tools in the context of hybridization studies. It can simulate dominant markers in hybridizing populations and predict their demographic evolution. In addition, we implement a new genome scan method for detecting outlier dominant loci in hybrids, which shows a rather high sensitivity and is very conservative in comparison with Gagnaire et al.'s, BAYESCAN and introgress.

Baum, David A.	Concordance trees, concordance factors, and the exploration of reticulate genealogy	TAXON	Reticulate evolution, whether due to lateral gene transfer, introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, or hybrid speciation, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, yet systematists have few tools for analyzing and summarizing the resulting genealogical discordance. Here I argue that a primary concordance tree, a tree built from clades that are true of a plurality of the genome, provides a useful summary of the dominant phylogenetic history for a group of organisms. Residual historical signals can also be extracted in the form of secondary, tertiary, etc. concordance trees, which are built from clades that are present in the genome but contradict clades on the primary concordance tree. Clades on concordance trees can be annotated with their concordance factor (CF), the proportion of the genome for which the clade is true. Concordance trees can potentially be estimated either from population histories or from multilocus molecular datasets. In the latter case one can use the recently developed Bayesian concordance analysis to obtain point estimates and credibility intervals on CF's. I argue that the concepts of concordance trees and concordance factors inform the debate on how to integrate information from multiple independent datasets and help clarify the nature of the boundary between reticulate and divergent genealogy.	2007	10.1002/tax.562013		Methods			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

The use of cytogenetic tools for studies in the crop-to-wild gene transfer scenario	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Interspecific hybridization in plants is an important evolutionary phenomenon involved in the dynamics of speciation that receives increasing interest in the context of possible gene escapes from transgenic crop varieties. Crops are able to cross-pollinate with a number of wild related species and exchange chromosome segments through homoeologous recombination. In this paper, we review a set of cytogenetic techniques that are appropriate to document the different steps required for the stable introgression of a chromosome segment from a donor species (i.e., the crop) into a recipient species (i.e., the wild). Several examples in hybrids and derivatives are given to illustrate how these approaches may be used to evaluate the potential for gene transfer between crops and wild relatives. Different techniques, from classical chromosome staining methods to recent developments in molecular cytogenetics, can be used to differentiate genomes and identify the chromosome regions eventually involved in genetic exchanges. Some clues are also given for the study of fertility restoration in the interspecific hybrid forms. Copyright (c) 2008 S.

Gompert, Zachariah; Buerkle, C. Alex	Bayesian estimation of genomic clines	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	We developed a Bayesian genomic cline model to study the genetic architecture of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between hybridizing lineages. This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture. 'Outlier' loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline parameters, and 'outlier' loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process.	2011	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05074.x		Methods			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Gompert, Zachariah; Buerkle, C. Alex	INTROGRESS: a software package for mapping components of isolation in hybrids	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	A new software package (introgress) provides functions for analysing introgression of genotypes between divergent, hybridizing lineages, including estimating genomic clines from multi-locus genotype data and testing for deviations from neutral expectations. The software works with co-dominant, dominant and haploid marker data, and does not require fixed allelic differences between parental populations for the sampled genetic markers. Permutation and parametric procedures generate neutral expectations for introgression and provide a basis for significance tests of observed genomic clines. The software also implements maximum likelihood estimates of hybrid index from genotypic data and a number of graphical analyses. The package is an extension of the R statistical software, is written in the R language and is freely available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; http://cran.r-project.org/). In this study, we describe introgress and demonstrate its use with a sample data set.	2010	10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02733.x		Methods			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Kim, Joungyoun; Anthony, Nicola M.; Larget, Bret R.	A Bayesian Method for Estimating Evolutionary History	BAYESIAN ANALYSIS	Phylogeography is the study of evolutionary history among populations in a species associated with geographic genetic variation. This paper examines the phylogeography of three African gorilla subspecies based on two types of DNA sequence data. One type is HV1, the first hyper-variable region in the control region of the mitochondrial genome. The other type is nuclear mitochondrial DNA (Numt DNA), which results from the introgression of a copy of HV1 from the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome. Numt and HV1 sequences evolve independently when in different organelles, but they share a common evolutionary history at the same locus in the mitochondrial genome prior to introgression. This study estimates the evolutionary history of gorilla populations in terms of population divergence times and effective population sizes. Also, this study estimates the number of introgression events. The estimates are obtained in a Bayesian framework using novel Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The method is based on a hybrid coalescent process that combines separate coalescent processes for HV1 and Numt sequences along with a transfer model for introgression events within a single population tree. This Bayesian method for the analysis of Numt and HV1 sequences is the first approach specifically designed to model the evolutionary history of homologous multi-locus sequences within a population tree framework. The data analysis reveals highly discordant estimates of the divergence time between eastern and western gorilla populations for HV1 and Numt sequences. The discordant east-west split times are evidence of male-mediated gene flow between east and west long after female gorillas stopped this migration. In addition, the analysis estimates multiple independent introgression events.	2012	10.1214/12-BA732		Methods			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Ropiquet, Anne; Li, Blaise; Hassanin, Alexandre	SuperTRI: A new approach based on branch support analyses of multiple independent data sets for assessing reliability of phylogenetic inferences	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES	Supermatrix and supertree are two methods for constructing a phylogenetic tree by using multiple data sets. However, these methods are not a panacea, as conflicting signals between data sets can lead to misinterpret the evolutionary history of taxa. In particular, the supermatrix approach is expected to be misleading if the species-tree signal is not dominant after the combination of the data sets. Moreover, most current supertree methods suffer from two limitations: (i) they ignore or misinterpret secondary (non-dominant) phylogenetic signals of the different data sets; and (ii) the logical basis of node robustness measures is unclear. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach, called SuperTRI, which is based on the branch support analyses of the independent data sets, and where the reliability of the nodes is assessed using three measures: the supertree Bootstrap percentage and two other values calculated from the separate analyses: the mean branch support (mean Bootstrap percentage or mean posterior probability) and the reproducibility index. The SuperTRI approach is tested on a data matrix including seven genes for 82 taxa of the family Bovidae (Mammalia, Ruminantia), and the results are compared to those found with the supermatrix approach. The phylogenetic analyses of the supermatrix and independent data sets were done using four methods of tree reconstruction: Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and unweighted and weighted maximum parsimony. The results indicate, firstly, that the SuperTRI approach shows less sensitivity to the four phylogenetic methods, secondly, that it is more accurate to interpret the relationships among taxa, and thirdly, that interesting conclusions on introgression and radiation can be drawn from the comparisons between SuperTRI and supermatrix analyses.

An effective method for interspecific introgression identification based on SNPs	CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES	Natural hybrids are usually detected after observation of intermediate morphological traits in specimens collected in sympatric areas of the parental species. However, the plasticity of external morphology may hinder introgressive hybrids, demanding an effective tool other than morphology to identify them, such as standardized molecular markers. In this paper we present a reliable method based on identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms of mitochondrial and nuclear genes used as a DNA barcode to indicate parental genome origin and detect hybrids. We also discuss the potential of this methodology in recognizing introgression (backcrossing) and bidirectional hybridization compared to other techniques.	2014	10.1007/s12686-014-0187-7		Methods			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Blischak, Paul D.; Chifman, Julia; Wolfe, Andrea D.; Kubatko, Laura S.	HyDe: A Python Package for Genome-Scale Hybridization Detection	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY	The analysis of hybridization and gene flow among closely related taxa is a common goal for researchers studying speciation and phylogeography. Many methods for hybridization detection use simple site pattern frequencies from observed genomic data and compare them to null models that predict an absence of gene flow. The theory underlying the detection of hybridization using these site pattern probabilities exploits the relationship between the coalescent process for gene trees within population trees and the process of mutation along the branches of the gene trees. For certain models, site patterns are predicted to occur in equal frequency (i.e., their difference is 0), producing a set of functions called phylogenetic invariants. In this article, we introduce HyDe, a software package for detecting hybridization using phylogenetic invariants arising under the coalescent model with hybridization.

Gompert, Z.; Buerkle, C. A.	bgc: Software for Bayesian estimation of genomic clines	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	Introgression in admixed populations can be used to identify candidate loci that might underlie adaptation or reproductive isolation. The Bayesian genomic cline model provides a framework for quantifying variable introgression in admixed populations and identifying regions of the genome with extreme introgression that are potentially associated with variation in fitness. Here we describe the bgc software, which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the joint posterior probability distribution of the parameters in the Bayesian genomic cline model and designate outlier loci. This software can be used with next-generation sequence data, accounts for uncertainty in genotypic state, and can incorporate information from linked loci on a genetic map. Output from the analysis is written to an HDF5 file for efficient storage and manipulation. This software is written in C++.

Schumer, Molly; Cui, Rongfeng; Rosenthal, Gil G.; Andolfatto, Peter	simMSG: an experimental design tool for high-throughput genotyping of hybrids	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	Hybridization between closely related species, whether naturally occurring or laboratory generated, is a useful tool for mapping the genetic basis of the phenotypic traits that distinguish species. The development of next-generation sequencing techniques has greatly improved our ability to assign ancestry to hybrid genomes. One such next-generation sequencing technique, multiplexed shotgun genotyping (or MSG), can be a powerful tool for genotyping hybrids. However, it is difficult a priori to predict the accuracy of MSG in natural hybrids because accuracy depends on ancestry tract length and number of ancestry informative markers. Here, we present a simulator, ` simMSG', that will allow researchers to design MSG experiments and show that in many cases MSG can accurately assign ancestry to hundreds of thousands of sites in the genomes of natural hybrids. The simMSG tool can be used to design experiments for diverse applications including QTL mapping, genotyping introgressed lines or admixture mapping.	2016	10.1111/1755-0998.12434		Methods dev			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Wringe, Brendan F.; Stanley, Ryan R. E.; Jeffery, Nicholas W.; Anderson, Eric C.; Bradbury, Ian R.	parallelnewhybrid: an R package for the parallelization of hybrid detection using NEWHYBRIDS	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	Hybridization among populations and species is a central theme in many areas of biology, and the study of hybridization has direct applicability to testing hypotheses about evolution, speciation and genetic recombination, as well as having conservation, legal and regulatory implications. Yet, despite being a topic of considerable interest, the identification of hybrid individuals, and quantification of the (un)certainty surrounding the identifications, remains difficult. Unlike other programs that exist to identify hybrids based on genotypic information, NEWHYBRIDS is able to assign individuals to specific hybrid classes (e.g. F-1, F-2) because it makes use of patterns of gene inheritance within each locus, rather than just the proportions of gene inheritance within each individual. For each comparison and set of markers, multiple independent runs of each data set should be used to develop an estimate of the hybrid class assignment accuracy. The necessity of analysing multiple simulated data sets, constructed from large genome-wide data sets, presents significant computational challenges. To address these challenges, we present parallel-newhybrid, an R package designed to decrease user burden when undertaking multiple NEWHYBRIDS analyses. parallelnewhybrid does so by taking advantage of the parallel computational capabilities inherent in modern computers to efficiently and automatically execute separate NEWHYBRIDS runs in parallel. We show that parallelization of analyses using this package affords users several-fold reductions in time over a traditional serial analysis. parallelnewhybrid consists of an example data set, a README and three operating system-specific functions to execute parallel NEWHYBRIDS analyses on each of a computer's c cores. parallelnewhybrid is freely available on the long-term software hosting site GITHUB (www.github.com/bwringe/parallelnewhybrid).	2017	10.1111/1755-0998.12597		Methods Dev			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Gompert, Zachariah	A Continuous Correlated Beta Process Model for Genetic Ancestry in Admixed Populations	PLOS ONE	Admixture and recombination create populations and genomes with genetic ancestry from multiple source populations. Analyses of genetic ancestry in admixed populations are relevant for trait and disease mapping, studies of speciation, and conservation efforts. Consequently, many methods have been developed to infer genome-average ancestry and to deconvolute ancestry into continuous local ancestry blocks or tracts within individuals. Current methods for local ancestry inference perform well when admixture occurred recently or hybridization is ongoing, or when admixture occurred in the distant past such that local ancestry blocks have fixed in the admixed population. However, methods to infer local ancestry frequencies in isolated admixed populations still segregating for ancestry do not exist. In the current paper, I develop and test a continuous correlated beta process model to fill this analytical gap. The method explicitly models autocorrelations in ancestry frequencies at the population-level and uses discriminant analysis of SNP windows to take advantage of ancestry blocks within individuals. Analyses of simulated data sets show that the method is generally accurate such that ancestry frequency estimates exhibited low root-mean-square error and were highly correlated with the true values, particularly when large (+/- 10 or +/- 20) SNP windows were used. Along these lines, the proposed method outperformed post hoc inference of ancestry frequencies from a traditional hidden Markov model (i.e., the linkage model in structure), particularly when admixture occurred more distantly in the past with little on-going gene flow or was followed by natural selection. The reliability and utility of the method was further assessed by analyzing genetic ancestry in an admixed human population (Uyghur) and three populations from a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. Considerable variation in ancestry frequencies was detected within and among chromosomes in the Uyghur, with a large region of excess French ancestry harboring a gene with a known disease association. Similar variation was detected in the mouse hybrid zone, with notable constancy in regions of excess ancestry among admixed populations. By filling what has been an analytical gap, the proposed method should be a useful tool for many biologists. A computer program (popanc), written in C++, has been developed based on the proposed method and is available on-line at http://sourceforge.net/projects/popanc/.	2016	10.1371/journal.pone.0151047		Methods dev + used on Mammals			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Flouri, Tomas; Jiao, Xiyun; Rannala, Bruce; Yang, Ziheng	A Bayesian Implementation of the Multispecies Coalescent Model with Introgression for Phylogenomic Analysis	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Recent analyses suggest that cross-species gene flow or introgression is common in nature, especially during species divergences. Genomic sequence data can be used to infer introgression events and to estimate the timing and intensity of introgression, providing an important means to advance our understanding of the role of gene flow in speciation. Here, we implement the multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression model, an extension of the multispecies-coalescent model to incorporate introgression, in our Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo program BPP. The multispecies-coalescent-withintrogression model accommodates deep coalescence (or incomplete lineage sorting) and introgression and provides a natural framework for inference using genomic sequence data. Computer simulation confirms the good statistical properties of the method, although hundreds or thousands of loci are typically needed to estimate introgression probabilities reliably. Reanalysis of data sets from the purple cone spruce confirms the hypothesis of homoploid hybrid speciation. We estimated the introgression probability using the genomic sequence data from six mosquito species in the Anopheles gambiae species complex, which varies considerably across the genome, likely driven by differential selection against introgressed alleles.	2020	10.1093/molbev/msz296		Methods dev- tested on plants + mosquito			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Pfeifer, Bastian; Kapan, Durrell D.	Estimates of introgression as a function of pairwise distances	BMC BIOINFORMATICS	BackgroundResearch over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows.ResultsWe introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity d(xy) and Patterson's D. The resulting statistic, the distance fraction (d(f)), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published f(d) and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on GitHub (pievos101/PopGenome) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework.ConclusionWe present a new distance based statistic d(f) that avoids the pitfalls of Patterson's D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.	2019	10.1186/s12859-019-2747-z		Methods dev- tested on plants + mosquito			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Shea, Daniel J.; Shimizu, Motoki; Nishida, Namiko; Fukai, Eigo; Abe, Takashi; Fujimoto, Ryo; Okazaki, Keiichi	IntroMap: a signal analysis based method for the detection of genomic introgressions	BMC GENETICS	Background: Breeding programs often rely on marker-assisted tests or variant calling of next generation sequence (NGS) data to identify regions of genomic introgression arising from the hybridization of two plant species. In this paper we present IntroMap, a bioinformatics pipeline for the screening of candidate plants through the application of signal processing techniques to NGS data, using alignment to a reference genome sequence (annotation is not required) that shares homology with the recurrent parental cultivar, and without the need for de novo assembly of the read data or variant calling. Results: We show the accurate identification of introgressed genomic regions using both in silico simulated genomes, and a hybridized cultivar data set using our pipeline. Additionally we show, through targeted marker-based assays, validation of the IntroMap predicted regions for the hybrid cultivar. Conclusions: This approach can be used to automate the screening of large populations, reducing the time and labor required, and can improve the accuracy of the detection of introgressed regions in comparison to a marker-based approach. In contrast to other approaches that generally rely upon a variant calling step, our method achieves accurate identification of introgressed regions without variant calling, relying solely upon alignment.	2017	10.1186/s12863-017-0568-5		Methods development for making introgression lines			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Gompert, Zachariah; Buerkle, C. Alex	A powerful regression-based method for admixture mapping of isolation across the genome of hybrids	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	We propose a novel method that uses natural admixture between divergent lineages (hybridization) to investigate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and adaptive introgression. Our method employs multinomial regression to estimate genomic clines and to quantify introgression for individual loci relative to the genomic background (clines in genotype frequency along a genomic admixture gradient). Loci with patterns of introgression that deviate significantly from null expectations based on the remainder of the genome are potentially subject to selection and thus of interest to understanding adaptation and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Using simulations, we show that different forms of selection modify these genomic clines in predictable ways and that our method has good power to detect moderate to strong selection for multiple forms of selection. Using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our method generally has a low false positive rate, except when genetic drift is particularly pronounced (e.g. low population size, low migration rates from parental populations, and substantial time since initial admixture). Additional individual-based simulations reveal that moderate selection against heterozygotes can be detected as much as 50 cm away from the focal locus directly experiencing selection, but is not detected at unlinked loci. Finally, we apply our analytical method to previously published data sets from a mouse (Mus musculus and M. domesticus) and two sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris and H. annuus) hybrid zones. This method should be applicable to numerous species that are currently the focus of research in evolution and ecology and should help bring about new insights regarding the processes underlying the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04098.x		Methods/Plants			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Lexer, Christian; Joseph, Jeffrey; van Loo, Marcela; Prenner, Gerhard; Heinze, Berthold; Chase, Mark W.; Kirkup, Don	The use of digital image-based morphometrics to study the phenotypic mosaic in taxa with porous genomes	TAXON	Rapid recent developments in DNA sequencing and genetic marker technologies call for the establishment of cost-effective, automated phenotyping assays for evolutionary biology and systematics, so that the effects of DNA polymorphisms and epigenetic changes on the phenotype call be evaluated. We discuss the use of digital image-based morphometrics in evolutionary biology and systematics with special emphasis oil Studies of taxa with porous genomes, i.e., taxa that do not conform to the traditional view of whole-genome isolation between species. We outline the phenomenon of the 'phenotypic mosaic' in taxa with porous genomes using well-documented examples from the literature and describe three important challenges arising for taxonomists: (1) character conflict in phylogenetic studies, (2) biased sampling of traits in morphological Studies, and (3) cryptic ecological speciation. We demonstrate the use of geometric morphometrics using a combined molecular and morphometric dataset from an interspecific hybrid zone between two divergent Eurasian species of Populus, P. alba (white poplar) and P. tremula (European aspen). Elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA)-based morphometric data were collected for 527 leaf specimens from 84 trees with known genomic composition as determined by a set of 30 nuclear DNA microsatellites. In addition, to demonstrate the case of scoring functionally relevant phenotypes via digital image analysis, quantitative differences in leaf reflectance were examined and their structural basis determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The EFA results indicate a heritable inter-individual component for symmetric aspects and all important intra-individual component for asymmetric aspects of variation in leaf outlines. Symmetric traits displayed a striking variety of phenotypes in hybrids compared to their parental species, consistent with the notion of the phenotypic mosaic. Linear discriminant analysis of these morphometric traits revealed (1) clear differentiation between parental species and (2) divergence between recombinant hybrids and their sympatric backcross parent P. alba, mediated primarily by two P. tremula-like and two transgressive traits. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of geometric morphometrics to interrogate multiple independent phenotypic characters and detect individual traits affected by introgression and divergence in taxa with porous genomes. Digital image-based morphometrics holds great promise for large-scale Studies of relationships between DNA polymorphism and phenotypes in evolutionary biology.	2009	10.1002/tax.582003		Methods/Plants			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Arnold, Michael L.; Fogarty, Nicole D.	Reticulate Evolution and Marine Organisms: The Final Frontier?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES	The role that reticulate evolution (i.e., via lateral transfer, viral recombination and/or introgressive hybridization) has played in the origin and adaptation of individual taxa and even entire clades continues to be tested for all domains of life. Though falsified for some groups, the hypothesis of divergence in the face of gene flow is becoming accepted as a major facilitator of evolutionary change for many microorganisms, plants and animals. Yet, the effect of reticulate evolutionary change in certain assemblages has been doubted, either due to an actual dearth of genetic exchange among the lineages belonging to these clades or because of a lack of appropriate data to test alternative hypotheses. Marine organisms represent such an assemblage. In the past half-century, some evolutionary biologists interested in the origin and trajectory of marine organisms, particularly animals, have posited that horizontal transfer, introgression and hybrid speciation have been rare. In this review, we provide examples of such genetic exchange that have come to light largely as a result of analyses of molecular markers. Comparisons among these markers and between these loci and morphological characters have provided numerous examples of marine microorganisms, plants and animals that possess the signature of mosaic genomes.	2009	10.3390/ijms10093836		Methods/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Hossain, Khwaja G.; Jackson, Scott A.; Kianian, Shahryar F.	Genome Structure and Chromosome Function	PLANT CYTOGENETICS: GENOME STRUCTURE AND CHROMOSOME FUNCTION	Aneuploidy refers to the loss or gain of individual chromosomes or loss of a portion of an individual chromosome from the normal chromosome set. The resulting gene-dosage imbalance may or may not noticeably affect phenotype. Although its phenotypic manifestations are usually apparent, information about the underlying alterations in structure, expression, and interphase organization of unbalanced chromosome sets is still sparse. Aneuploidy is the most common chromosomal aberration in plants, and aneuploids are valuable for the study of chromosome evolution, phenotypic manifestation of chromosome loss or gain, and mapping genes and genome. Breeding programs intended to transfer desirable genes from one species to another produce addition lines as intermediate crossing products. Such aneuploids can be used for further introgression, but their abnormal recombination and segregation interfere with production of stable introgression lines. They can have specific morphological characteristics, but more often additional confirmation is needed. Their genetic and cytogenetic properties make them powerful tools for fundamental research on regulation of homeologous recombination, distribution of chromosome-specific markers and repetitive DNA sequences, and regulation of heterologous gene expression. Recent advancements and availability of genomic resources have widened the scope for their use. They make possible assignment of individual linkage groups to specific chromosomes and can improve identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and underlying DNA components/sequences.	2012	10.1007/978-0-387-70869-0_2	10.1007/978-0-387-70869-0	Methods/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Some breeding strategies based on evaluation of combining ability have been produced, and are still extensively used in hybrid breeding. In this review, the genetic basis underlying these breeding strategies is discussed, and a potential genetic control of general combining ability (GCA) is postulated. We suggested that GCA and the yields of inbred lines might be genetically controlled by different sets of loci on the maize genome that are transmitted into offspring. Different inbred lines might possess different favorable alleles for GCA. In hybrids, loci involved in multiple pathways, which are directly or indirectly associated with yield performance, might be regulated by GCA loci. In addition, a case of GCA mapping using a set of testcross progeny from introgression lines is provided.	2012	10.1016/S1671-2927(12)60781-0		Methods/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Petit, Remy J.; Excoffier, Laurent	Gene flow and species delimitation	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	A defining feature of species is that their constituting populations are connected by gene flow. However, interspecific gene flow (introgression) can affect species integrity. If some genome components were less prone to introgression than others, they should be particularly suitable to delimitate species. Recent simulation studies have predicted a negative correlation between intra- and interspecific gene flow, suggesting that markers associated with the most dispersing sex should better delimitate species. A review of studies of introgression in species with sex-biased dispersal largely confirms this prediction. Hence, species delimitation should be more effective with markers experiencing high levels of gene flow, a simple but not widely appreciated prediction.	2009	10.1016/j.tree.2009.02.011		Methods/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Twyford, A. D.; Ennos, R. A.	Next-generation hybridization and introgression	HEREDITY	Hybridization has a major role in evolution-from the introgression of important phenotypic traits between species, to the creation of new species through hybrid speciation. Molecular studies of hybridization aim to understand the class of hybrids and the frequency of introgression, detect the signature of ancient hybridization, and understand the behaviour of introgressed loci in their new genomic background. This often involves a large investment in the design and application of molecular markers, leading to a compromise between the depth and breadth of genomic data. New techniques designed to assay a large sub-section of the genome, in association with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, will allow genome-wide hybridization and introgression studies in organisms with no prior sequence data. These detailed genotypic data will unite the breadth of sampling of loci characteristic of population genetics with the depth of sequence information associated with molecular phylogenetics. In this review, we assess the theoretical and methodological constraints that limit our understanding of natural hybridization, and promote the use of NGS for detecting hybridization and introgression between non-model organisms. We also make recommendations for the ways in which emerging techniques, such as pooled barcoded amplicon sequencing and restriction site-associated DNA tags, should be used to overcome current limitations, and enhance our understanding of this evolutionary significant process.

Chan, KMA; Levin, SA	Leaky prezygotic isolation and porous genomes: Rapid introgression of maternally inherited DNA	EVOLUTION	Accurate phylogenies are crucial for understanding evolutionary processes, especially species diversification. It is commonly assumed that "good" species are sufficiently isolated genetically that gene genealogies represent accurate phylogenies. However, it is increasingly clear that good species may continue to exchange genetic material through hybridization (introgression). Many studies of closely related species reveal introgression of some genes without others, often with more rapid introgression of maternally inherited chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA (cpDNA, mtDNA). We seek a general explanation for this biased introgression using simple models of common reproductive isolating barriers (RIBs). We compare empirically informed models of prezygotic isolation (for pre- and post-insemination mechanisms of both female choice and male competition) with postzygotic isolation and demonstrate that rate of introgression depends critically upon type of RIB and mode of genetic inheritance (maternal versus biparental versus paternal). Our frequency-dependent prezygotic RIBs allow much more rapid introgression of biparentally and maternally inherited genes than do commonly modeled postzygotic RIBs (especially maternally inherited DNA). After considering the specific predictions in the context of empirical observations, we conclude that our model of prezygotic RIBs is a general explanation for biased introgression of maternally inherited genomic components. These findings suggest that we should use extreme caution when interpreting single gene genealogies as species phylogenies, especially for cpDNA and mtDNA.	2005			Model			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Ghenu, Ana-Hermina; Blanckaert, Alexandre; Butlin, Roger K.; Kulmuni, Jonna; Bank, Claudia	Conflict between heterozygote advantage and hybrid incompatibility in haplodiploids (and sex chromosomes)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	In many diploid species, the sex chromosomes play a special role in mediating reproductive isolation. In haplodiploids, where females are diploid and males haploid, the whole genome behaves similarly to the X/Zchromosomes of diploids. Therefore, haplodiploid systems can serve as a model for the role of sex chromosomes in speciation and hybridization. A previously described population of Finnish Formica wood ants displays genome-wide signs of ploidally and sexually antagonistic selection resulting from hybridization. Here, hybrid females have increased survivorship but hybrid males are inviable. To understand how the unusual hybrid population may be maintained, we developed a mathematical model with hybrid incompatibility, female heterozygote advantage, recombination and assortative mating. The rugged fitness landscape resulting from the co-occurrence of heterozygote advantage and hybrid incompatibility results in a sexual conflict in haplodiploids, which is caused by the ploidy difference. Thus, whereas heterozygote advantage always promotes long-term polymorphism in diploids, we find various outcomes in haplodiploids in which the population stabilizes either in favour of males, females or via maximizing the number of introgressed individuals. We discuss these outcomes with respect to the potential long-term fate of the Finnish wood ant population and provide approximations for the extension of the model to multiple incompatibilities. Moreover, we highlight the general implications of our results for speciation and hybridization in haplodiploids versus diploids and how the described fitness relationships could contribute to the outstanding role of sex chromosomes as hotspots of sexual antagonism and genes involved in speciation.	2018	10.1111/mec.14482		Model			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Quilodran, Claudio S.; Currat, Mathias; Montoya-Burgos, Juan I.	Effect of hybridization with genome exclusion on extinction risk	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY	Human-induced habitat changes may lead to the breakdown of reproductive barriers between distantly related species. This phenomenon may result in fertile first-generation hybrids (F-1) that exclude the genome of one parental species during gametogenesis, thus disabling introgression. The species extinction risk associated with hybridization with genome exclusion is largely underappreciated because the phenomenon produces only F-1 hybrid phenotype, leading to the misconception that hybrids are sterile and potentially of minor conservation concern. We used a simulation model that integrates the main genetic, demographic, and ecological processes to examine the dynamics of hybridization with genome exclusion. We showed that this mode of hybridization may lead to extremely rapid extinction when the process of genome exclusion is unbalanced between the interbreeding species and when the hybridization rate is not negligible. The coexistence of parental species was possible in some cases of asymmetrical genome exclusion, but show this equilibrium was highly vulnerable to environmental variation. Expanding the exclusive habitat of the species at risk allowed its persistence. Our results highlight the extent of possible extinction risk due to hybridization with genome exclusion and suggest habitat management as a promising conservation strategy. In anticipation of serious threats to biodiversity due to hybridization with genome exclusion, we recommend a detailed assessment of the reproductive status of hybrids in conservation programs. We suggest such assessments include the inspection of genetic content in hybrid gametes. Efectos de la Hibridacion con Exclusion Genomica sobre el Riesgo de Extincion Los cambios en el habitat inducidos por el humano pueden derivar en la disrupcion de las barreras reproductivas entre especies relacionadas lejanamente. Este fenomeno puede resultar en hibridos fertiles de primera generacion (F-1) que excluyen el genoma de una de las especies parentales durante la gametogenesis, inhabilitando asi la introgresion. El riesgo de extincion de la especie asociado con la hibridacion con exclusion genomica es poco apreciado debido a que el fenomeno produce solamente el fenotipo hibrido F-1, lo que conduce al malentendido de que los hibridos son esteriles y potencialmente de menor interes para la conservacion. Usamos un modelo de simulacion que integra a los principales procesos geneticos, demograficos y ecologicos para examinar las dinamicas de hibridacion con exclusion genomica. Mostramos que este modo de hibridacion puede llevar a una extincion extremadamente rapida cuando el proceso de exclusion genomica no esta balanceado entre las especies que se cruzan y cuando la tasa de hibridacion no es insignificante. La coexistencia de especies parentales fue posible en algunos casos de exclusion genomica asimetrica, pero mostraron que este equilibrio era altamente vulnerable a la variacion ambiental. La expansion del habitat exclusivo de las especies en riesgo permitio su persistencia. Nuestros resultados resaltan el alcance del riesgo de una posible extincion por causa de la hibridacion con exclusion genomica y sugieren al manejo del habitat como una estrategia de conservacion prometedora. En anticipacion a amenazas serias para la biodiversidad debidas a la hibridacion con exclusion genomica, recomendamos una evaluacion detallada del estado reproductivo de los hibridos dentro de programas de conservacion. Sugerimos que dichas evaluaciones incluyan la inspeccion del contenido genetico en los gametos hibridos. Resumen ?? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Currat, Mathias; Ruedi, Manuel; Petit, Remy J.; Excoffier, Laurent	The hidden side of invasions: Massive introgression by local genes	EVOLUTION	Despite hundreds of reports involving both plants and animals, the mechanisms underlying introgression remain obscure, even if some form of selection is frequently invoked. Introgression has repeatedly been reported in species that have recently colonized a new habitat, suggesting that demographic processes should be given more attention for understanding the mechanisms of introgression. Here we show by spatially explicit simulations that massive introgression of neutral genes takes place during the invasion of an occupied territory if interbreeding is not severely prevented between the invading and the local species. We also demonstrate that introgression occurs almost exclusively from the local to the invading species, especially for populations located far away from the source of the invasion, and this irrespective of the relative densities of the two species. This pattern is strongest at markers experiencing reduced gene flow, in keeping with the observation that organelle genes are often preferentially introgressed across species boundaries. A survey of the literature shows that a majority of published empirical studies of introgression during range expansions, in animals and in plants, follow the predictions of our model. Our results imply that speciation genes can be identified by comparing genomes of interfertile native and invading species pairs.	2008	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00413.x		Model/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Hvala, John A.; Frayer, Megan E.; Payseur, Bret A.	Signatures of hybridization and speciation in genomic patterns of ancestry	EVOLUTION	Genomes sampled from hybrid zones between nascent species provide important clues into the speciation process. With advances in genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, it is now feasible to measure variation in gene flow with high genomic resolution. This progress motivates the development of conceptual and analytical frameworks for hybrid zones that complement well-established dine approaches. We extend the perspective that genomic distributions of ancestry are sensitive indicators of hybridization history. We use simulations to examine the behavior of the number of ancestry junctions-a simple summary of genomic patterns-in hybrid zones under increasingly realistic scenarios. Neutral simulations revealed that ancestry junction number is shaped by population structure, migration rate, and population size. Modeling multiple genetic architectures of hybrid dysfunction, with an emphasis on epistitic hybrid incompatibilities, showed that selection reduces junction number near loci that confer reproductive barriers. The magnitude of this signature was affected by the form of selection, dominance, and genomic location (autosome vs. sex chromosome) of incompatible loci. Our results suggest that researchers can identify loci involved in reproductive isolation by scanning hybrid genomes for local reductions in junction number. We outline necessary directions for future theory and method development to realize this goal.	2018	10.1111/evo.13509		Model/Sim (about recombination! V. useful!)			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Fusco, Diana; Uyenoyama, Marcy K.	Sex-Specific Incompatibility Generates Locus-Specific Rates of Introgression Between Species	GENETICS	Disruption of interactions among ensembles of epistatic loci has been shown to contribute to reproductive isolation among various animal and plant species. Under the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, such interspecific incompatibility arises as a by-product of genetic divergence in each species, and the Orr-Turelli model indicates that the number of loci involved in incompatible interactions may "snowball" over time. We address the combined effect of multiple incompatibility loci on the rate of introgression at neutral marker loci across the genome. Our analysis extends previous work by accommodating sex specificity: differences between the sexes in the expression of incompatibility, in rates of crossing over between neutral markers and incompatibility loci, and in transmission of markers or incompatibility factors. We show that the evolutionary process at neutral markers in a genome subject to incompatibility selection is well approximated by a purely neutral process with migration rates appropriately scaled to reflect the influence of selection targeted to incompatibility factors. We confirm that in the absence of sex specificity and functional epistasis among incompatibility factors, the barrier to introgression induced by multiple incompatibility factors corresponds to the product of the barriers induced by the factors individually. A new finding is that barriers to introgression due to sex-specific incompatibility depart in general from multiplicativity. Our partitioning of variation in relative reproductive rate suggests that such departures derive from associations between sex and incompatibility and between sex and neutral markers. Concordant sex-specific incompatibility (for example, greater impairment of male hybrids or longer map lengths in females) induces lower barriers (higher rates of introgression) than expected under multiplicativity, and discordant sex-specific incompatibility induces higher barriers.	2011	10.1534/genetics.111.130732		Models			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Meng, Chen; Kubatko, Laura Salter	Detecting hybrid speciation in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting using gene tree incongruence: A model	THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY	The application of phylogenetic inference methods, to data for a set of independent genes sampled randomly throughout the genome, often results in substantial incongruence in the single-gene phylogenetic estimates. Among the processes known to produce discord between single-gene phylogenies, two of the best studied in a phylogenetic context are hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. Much recent attention has focused on the development of methods for estimating species phylogenies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, but phylogenetic models that allow for hybridization have been more limited. Here we propose a model that allows incongruence in single-gene phylogenies to be due to both hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting, with the goal of determining the contribution of hybridization to observed gene tree incongruence in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. Using our model, we propose methods for estimating the extent of the role of hybridization in both a likelihood and a Bayesian framework. The performance of our methods is examined using both simulated and empirical data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2009	10.1016/j.tpb.2008.10.004		Models			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Takahasi, K. Ryo; Matsuo, Takashi; Takano-Shimizu-Kouno, Toshiyuki	Two types of cis-trans compensation in the evolution of transcriptional regulation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Because distant species often share similar macromolecules, regulatory mutations are often considered responsible for much of their biological differences. Recently, a large portion of regulatory changes has been attributed to cis-regulatory mutations. Here, we examined an alternative possibility that the putative contribution of cis-regulatory changes was, in fact, caused by compensatory action of cis- and trans-regulatory elements. First, we show by stochastic simulations that compensatory cis- trans evolution maintains the binding affinity of a transcription factor at a constant level, thereby spuriously exaggerating the contribution of cis-regulatory mutations to gene expression divergence. This exaggeration was not observed when changes in the binding affinity were compensated by variable transcription factor concentration. Second, using reciprocal introgressions of Drosophila, we show that relative expression of heterozygous alleles from two distinct species often varied significantly between different species backgrounds, indicating the possible action of cis-trans compensation. Taken together, we propose that cis-trans hybrid incompatibilities are accumulating much faster than generally considered.	2011	10.1073/pnas.1105814108		Models			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Nosil, Patrik; Funk, Daniel J.; Ortiz-Barrientos, Daniel	Divergent selection and heterogeneous genomic divergence	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Levels of genetic differentiation between populations can be highly variable across the genome, with divergent selection contributing to such heterogeneous genomic divergence. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly physically linked to them may exhibit stronger differentiation than neutral regions with weak or no linkage to such loci. Divergent selection can also increase genome-wide neutral differentiation by reducing gene flow (e.g. by causing ecological speciation), thus promoting divergence via the stochastic effects of genetic drift. These consequences of divergent selection are being reported in recently accumulating studies that identify: (i) 'outlier loci' with higher levels of divergence than expected under neutrality, and (ii) a positive association between the degree of adaptive phenotypic divergence and levels of molecular genetic differentiation across population pairs ['isolation by adaptation' (IBA)]. The latter pattern arises because as adaptive divergence increases, gene flow is reduced (thereby promoting drift) and genetic hitchhiking increased. Here, we review and integrate these previously disconnected concepts and literatures. We find that studies generally report 5-10% of loci to be outliers. These selected regions were often dispersed across the genome, commonly exhibited replicated divergence across different population pairs, and could sometimes be associated with specific ecological variables. IBA was not infrequently observed, even at neutral loci putatively unlinked to those under divergent selection. Overall, we conclude that divergent selection makes diverse contributions to heterogeneous genomic divergence. Nonetheless, the number, size, and distribution of genomic regions affected by selection varied substantially among studies, leading us to discuss the potential role of divergent selection in the growth of regions of differentiation (i.e. genomic islands of divergence), a topic in need of future investigation.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03946.x		Models/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Correa, Alberto S.; Cordeiro, Erick M. G.; Omoto, Celso	Agricultural insect hybridization and implications for pest management	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE	Biological invasions, the expansion of agricultural frontiers, and climate change favor encounters of divergent lineages of animals and plants, increasing the likelihood of hybridization. However, hybridization of insect species and its consequences for agroecosystems have not received sufficient attention. Gene exchange between distinct and distant genetic pools can improve the survival and reproduction of insect pests, and threaten beneficial insects in disturbed agricultural environments. Hybridization may be the underlying explanation for the recurrent pest outbreaks and control failures in putative hybrid zones, as suspected for bollworm, corn borer, whiteflies, and stink bugs. Reliable predictions of the types of changes that can be expected in pest insect genomes and fitness, and of their impacts on the fate of species and populations remain elusive. Typical steps in pest management, such as insect identification, pest monitoring, and control are likely affected by gene flow and adaptive introgression mediated by hybridization, and we do not have ways to respond to or mitigate the problem. To address the adverse effects of farming intensification and global trade, we must ensure that current integrated pest management programs incorporate up-to-date monitoring and diagnostic tools. The rapid identification of hybrids, quantification of levels of introgression, and in-depth knowledge of what genes have been transferred may help to explain and predict insect population outbreaks and control failures in the future.

Nouhaud, Pierre; Blanckaert, Alexandre; Bank, Claudia; Kulmuni, Jonna	Understanding Admixture: Haplodiploidy to the Rescue	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	Hybridization has broad evolutionary consequences, from fueling or counteracting speciation to facilitating adaptation to novel environments. Hybridization and subsequent introgression appear widespread along the tree of life. However, our understanding of how distinct evolutionary forces shape admixed genomes and the fate of introgressed genetic variants remains scarce. Most admixture research in animals has focused on diploid organisms. Wepropose that haplodiploid organisms can help resolve open questions about the genomic consequences of hybridization in natural populations. The ploidy difference between haploid males and diploid females, the availability of genome-wide male haplotypes, and ongoing cases of admixture make haplodiploid organisms promising models to improve our knowledge with regards to the evolution of hybrid genomes.	2020	10.1016/j.tree.2019.08.013		Opinion/Review			FALSE	TRUE		FALSE			FALSE	
Atyame, Celestine M.; Delsuc, Frederic; Pasteur, Nicole; Weill, Mylene; Duron, Olivier	Diversification of Wolbachia Endosymbiont in the Culex pipiens Mosquito	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The alpha-proteobacteria Wolbachia are among the most common intracellular bacteria and have recently emerged as important drivers of arthropod biology. Wolbachia commonly act as reproductive parasites in arthropods by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a type of conditional sterility between hosts harboring incompatible infections. In this study, we examined the evolutionary histories of Wolbachia infections, known as wPip, in the common house mosquito Culex pipiens, which exhibits the greatest variation in CI crossing patterns observed in any insect. We first investigated a panel of 20 wPip strains for their genetic diversity through a multilocus scheme combining 13 Wolbachia genes. Because Wolbachia depend primarily on maternal transmission for spreading within arthropod populations, we also studied the variability in the coinherited Cx. pipiens mitochondria. In total, we identified 14 wPip haplotypes, which all share a monophyletic origin and clearly cluster into five distinct wPip groups. The diversity of Cx. pipiens mitochondria was extremely reduced, which is likely a consequence of cytoplasmic hitchhiking driven by a unique and recent Wolbachia invasion. Phylogenetic evidence indicates that wPip infections and mitochondrial DNA have codiverged through stable cotransmission within the cytoplasm and shows that a rapid diversification of wPip has occurred. The observed pattern demonstrates that a considerable degree of Wolbachia diversity can evolve within a single host species over short evolutionary periods. In addition, multiple signatures of recombination were found in most wPip genomic regions, leading us to conclude that the mosaic nature of wPip genomes may play a key role in their evolution.	2011	10.1093/molbev/msr083		Other			TRUE	TRUE	wolbachia introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Oleastro, Monica; Rocha, Raquel; Vale, Filipa F.	Population genetic structure of Helicobacter pylori strains from Portuguese-speaking countries	HELICOBACTER	Background: The human gastric colonizer Helicobacter pylori is useful to track human migrations given the agreement between the bacterium phylogeographic distribution and human migrations. As Portugal was an African and Brazilian colonizer for over 400 years, we hypothesized that Portuguese isolates were likely genetically closer with those from countries colonized by Portuguese in the past. We aimed to characterize the population structure of several Portuguese-speaking countries, including Portugal, Brazil, Angola, and Cape Verde. Materials and Methods: We included strains isolated in Portugal from Portuguese and from former Portuguese colonies. These strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for seven housekeeping genes. We also retrieved from Multi Locus Sequence Typing Web site additional housekeeping gene sequences, namely from Angola and Brazil. Results: We provided evidence that strains from Portuguese belong to hpEurope and that the introgression of hpEurope in non-European countries that speak Portuguese is low, except for Brazil and Cape Verde, where hpEurope accounted for one quarter and one half of the population, respectively. We found genetic similarity for all strains from Portuguese-speaking countries that belong to hpEurope population. Moreover, these strains showed a predominance of ancestral Europe 2 (AE2) over ancestral Europe 1 (AE1), followed by ancestral Africa 1. Conclusions: H. pylori is a useful marker even for relative recent human migration events and may become rapidly differentiated from founder populations. H. pylori from Portuguese-speaking countries assigned to hpEurope appears to be a hybrid population resulting from the admixture of AE1, AE2 and ancestral hpAfrica1.	2017	10.1111/hel.12382		Other			TRUE	TRUE	introgression as disease movement	FALSE			FALSE	
Lindsey, A. R. I.; Stouthamer, R.	The effects of outbreeding on a parasitoid wasp fixed for infection with a parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia symbiont	HEREDITY	Trichogramma wasps can be rendered asexual by infection with the maternally inherited symbiont Wolbachia. Previous studies indicate the Wolbachia strains infecting Trichogramma wasps are host-specific, inferred by failed horizontal transfer of Wolbachia to novel Trichogramma hosts. Additionally, Trichogramma can become dependent upon their Wolbachia infection for the production of female offspring, leaving them irreversibly asexual, further linking host and symbiont. We hypothesized Wolbachia strains infecting irreversibly asexual, resistant to horizontal transfer Trichogramma would show adaptation to a particular host genetic background. To test this, we mated Wolbachia-dependent females with males from a Wolbachia-naive population to create heterozygous wasps. We measured sex ratios and fecundity, a proxy for Wolbachia fitness, produced by heterozygous wasps, and by their recombinant offspring. We find a heterozygote advantage, resulting in higher fitness for Wolbachia, as wasps will produce more offspring without any reduction in the proportion of females. While recombinant wasps did not differ in total fecundity after 10 days, recombinants produced fewer offspring early on, leading to an increased female-biased sex ratio for the whole brood. Despite the previously identified barriers to horizontal transfer of Wolbachia to and from Trichogramma pretiosum, there were no apparent barriers for Wolbachia to induce parthenogenesis in these non-native backgrounds. This is likely due to the route of infection being introgression rather than horizontal transfer, and possibly the co-evolution of Wolbachia with the mitochondria rather than the nuclear genome. These results help to elucidate the mechanisms by which Wolbachia adapt to hosts and the evolution of host-symbiont phenotypes.	2017	10.1038/hdy.2017.53		Other			TRUE	TRUE	experimental cross, I think	FALSE			FALSE	
Martinez-Rodriguez, Paloma; Bella, Jose L.	Chorthippus parallelus and Wolbachia: Overlapping Orthopteroid and Bacterial Hybrid Zones	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS	Wolbachia is a well-known endosymbiotic, strictly cytoplasmic bacterium. It establishes complex cytonuclear relations that are not necessarily deleterious to its host, but that often result in reproductive alterations favoring bacterial transmission. Among these alterations, a common one is the cytoplasmic incompatibility (Cl) that reduces the number of descendants in certain crosses between infected and non-infected individuals. This Cl induced by Wolbachia appears in the hybrid zone that the grasshoppers Chorthippus parallelus parallelus (Cpp) and C. p. erythropus (Cpe) form in the Pyrenees: a reputed model in evolutionary biology. However, this cytonuclear incompatibility is the result of sophisticated processes of the co-divergence of the genomes of the bacterial strains and the host after generations of selection and coevolution. Here we show how these genome conflicts have resulted in a finely tuned adjustment of the bacterial strain to each pure orthopteroid taxon, and the striking appearance of another, newly identified recombinant Wolbachia strain that only occurs in hybrid grasshoppers. We propose the existence of two superimposed hybrid zones: one organized by the grasshoppers, which overlaps with a second, bacterial hybrid zone. The two hybrid zones counterbalance one another and have evolved together since the origin of the grasshopper's hybrid zone.	2018	10.3389/fgene.2018.00604		Other			TRUE	TRUE	no introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Lane, CE; Saunders, GW	Molecular investigation reveals epi/endophytic extrageneric kelp (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) gametophytes colonizing Lessoniopsis littoralis thalli	BOTANICA MARINA	A recent molecular investigation of kelp systematics revealed mitochondrial sequences that gave phylogenies inconsistent with those based on nuclear and chloroplast sequences for the species Lessoniopsis littoralis. Sequence from the mitochondrial nad6 region placed L. littoralis in the middle of a clade of Alaria species in our trees, whereas Rubisco and nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences resolved L. littoralis within the Alariaceae, but distinct from Alaria. To resolve these conflicting results, the nad6 region was sequenced from additional samples of L. littoralis. The resulting data variously placed L. littoralis with Macrocystis integrifolia, Nereocystis luetkeana, and an additional Alaria isolate. A series of hypotheses were devised and explored to effectively exclude introgression via hybridization as a viable explanation for our observations. Rather, molecular and microscopy data revealed that gametophytes of Alaria, Macrocystis and Nereocystis epi/endophytically, colonize the older portions of the thallus of L. littoralis. A substantial primer mismatch, unique to L. littoralis, was uncovered subsequently explaining why nad6 sequences from only Alaria, Macrocystis and Nereocystis were amplified from L. littoralis sporophyte samples, although the DNA from the gametophytes likely represented only a small percentage of the total DNA extracted.	2005	10.1515/BOT.2005.056		Other			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Elias, MCQB; Vargas, N; Tomazi, L; Pedroso, A; Zingales, B; Schenkman, S; Briones, MRS	Comparative analysis of genomic sequences suggests that Trypanosoma cruzi CL Brener contains two sets of non-intercalated repeats of satellite DNA that correspond to T. cruzi I and T. cruzi II types	MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY	Approximately 10% of the Trypanosoma cruzi. genome is formed by a satellite DNA, composed by 195-bp repeats organized in 30 +/- 10 kb clusters in some, but not all chromosomes. Here, the satellite DNA of six representative T. cruzi strains was sequenced and used for phylogenetic inference. The results show that CL Brener contains satellite repeats from T. cruzi I and T. cruzi II strains, although type II sequences are more abundant. The presence of types I and II sequences extends previous propositions that genetic exchange between the two major T. cruzi lineages have occurred in CL Brener, although our data accommodate alternative scenarios of hybridization within T. cruzi II, as proposed by others. Altogether, present data suggest a complex origin for CL Brener. Sequence analysis of satellites isolated from chromosomal bands indicates that satellite DNA sequences are not chromosome specific. Neighbor analysis of in tandem satellite DNAs containing up to five repeats shows that each cluster contains only one type of sequence. Consequently, clusters with intercalated types I and II repeats were not found. We propose that the CL Brener genome contains large pieces of satellite DNA originated mainly from chromosomes of T. cruzi II with introgression of T. cruzi I lineage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Hamilton, Jill A.; Miller, Joshua M.	Adaptive introgression as a resource for management and genetic conservation in a changing climate	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY	Current rates of climate change require organisms to respond through migration, phenotypic plasticity, or genetic changes via adaptation. We focused on questions regarding species' and populations' ability to respond to climate change through adaptation. Specifically, the role adaptive introgression, movement of genetic material from the genome of 1 species into the genome of another through repeated interbreeding, may play in increasing species' ability to respond to a changing climate. Such interspecific gene flow may mediate extinction risk or consequences of limited adaptive potential that result from standing genetic variation and mutation alone, enabling a quicker demographic recovery in response to changing environments. Despite the near dismissal of the potential benefits of hybridization by conservation practitioners, we examined a number of case studies across different taxa that suggest gene flow between sympatric or parapatric sister species or within species that exhibit strong ecotypic differentiation may represent an underutilized management option to conserve evolutionary potential in a changing environment. This will be particularly true where advanced-generation hybrids exhibit adaptive traits outside the parental phenotypic range, a phenomenon known as transgressive segregation. The ideas presented in this essay are meant to provoke discussion regarding how we maintain evolutionary potential, the conservation value of natural hybrid zones, and consideration of their important role in adaptation to climate.	2016	10.1111/cobi.12574		Perspective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Wielstra, Ben	Historical hybrid zone movement: More pervasive than appreciated	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY	Hybrid zones are established where two divergent populations meet and interbreed, but experience some reproductive isolation. If one population expands its range at the expense of the other, their hybrid zone moves. While hybrid zone movement is generally considered to be uncommon and insignificant, recent studies challenge this idea. The commonality of contemporary hybrid zone movement-with shifts in hybrid zones tracked over years to decennia-cannot be disputed, given the many examples available. Cases of historical hybrid zone movement-covering centuries or millennia of mobility-are accumulating, with movement having been inferred from five lines of evidence: (1) range shifts documented in the fossil/pollen record; (2) distribution dynamics derived from species distribution modelling; (3) enclaves of a displaced population persisting inside the range of an expanding one; (4) a peak of linkage disequilibrium at the leading edge of a moving hybrid zone; and (5) genome-wide genetic traces of a displaced population, left behind in an expanding one. While most of these lines of evidence are not straightforward to interpret and/or broadly applicable, the latter-a genomic footprint of hybrid zone movement-promises to be particularly suitable to determine whether a hybrid zone has been on the move since its inception. I argue that historical hybrid zone movement is likely to be prevalent and deserves wider acknowledgement in historical biogeography.	2019	10.1111/jbi.13600		perspective/review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Gurushidze, Maia; Fritsch, Reinhard M.; Blattner, Frank R.	Phylogenetic analysis of Allium subg. Melanocrommyum infers cryptic species and demands a new sectional classification	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Allium subgenus Melanocrommyum (Alliaceae) from Eurasia comprises about 150 mostly diploid species adapted to and conditions. The group is taxonomically complicated with different and contradictory taxonomic treatments, and was thought to include a considerable number of hybrid species, as the taxa show an admixture of assumed morphological key characters. We studied the phylogeny of the subgenus, covering all existing taxonomic groups and their entire geographic distribution. We analyzed sequences of the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) for multiple individuals of more than 100 species. Phylogenetic analyses of cloned and directly sequenced PCR products confirmed the monophyly of the subgenus, while most sections were either para- or polyphyletic. The splits of the large sections are supported by differences in the anatomy of flower nectaries. ITS data (i) demand a new treatment at sectional level, (ii) do not support the hypotheses of frequent gene flow among species, (iii) indicate that multiple rapid radiations occurred within different monophyletic groups of the subgenus, and (iv) detected separately evolving lineages within three morphologically clearly defined species (cryptic species). In two cases these lineages were close relatives, while in Allium darwasicum they fall in quite different clades in the phylogenetic tree. Fingerprint markers show that this result is not due to ongoing introgression of rDNA (ITS capture) but that genome-wide differences between both lineages exist. Thus, we report one of the rare cases in plants where morphologically indistinguishable diploid species occurring in mixed populations are non-sister cryptic species. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The taxonomic status of Solanum ruiz-lealii Brucher (rzl), a diploid species endemic to Mendoza province, Argentina, is controversial. It has been described as a new species of non-hybrid origin and as a natural hybrid between S. kurtzianum Bitt. & Wittm. (ktz) and S. chacoense Bitt. (chc). The hypothesis of the hybrid origin of rzl is examined systematically for the first time by phenetic analyses of morphological and molecular (SSR markers) data, and cytological analyses of interspecific hybrids. The morphological, cytological and molecular data are congruent, and suggest that rzl is not a recent natural hybrid between the ktz and the chc populations studied but has probably originated by divergence of chc, or by hybridization between chc and another taxon.	2005	10.1007/s00606-005-0299-3		Plants			TRUE	FALSE		FALSE	NOT INCLUDED; PCA/phylogeny; trying to assess whether a species was of hybrid origin, didn't find evidence		FALSE

No evidence of contemporary interploidy gene flow between the closely related European woodland violets Viola reichenbachiana and V.riviniana (sect. Viola, Violaceae)	PLANT BIOLOGY	Viola reichenbachiana (2n=4x=20) and V.riviniana (2n=8x=40) are closely related species widely distributed in Europe, often sharing the same habitat throughout their overlapping ranges. It has been suggested in numerous studies that their high intraspecific morphological variability and plasticity might have been further increased by interspecific hybridisation in contact zones, given the sympatry of the species and the incomplete sterility of their hybrid. The aims of this study were to: (i) confirm that V.reichenbachiana and V.riviniana have one 4x genome in common, and (ii) determine the impact of hybridisation and introgression on genetic variation of these two species in selected European populations. For our study, we used 31 Viola populations from four European countries, which were analysed using AFLP and sequencing of a variable plastid intergenic spacer, trnH-psbA. Our analysis revealed that V.reichenbachiana exhibited larger haplotype diversity, having three species-specific haplotypes versus one in V.riviniana. The relationships among haplotypes suggest transfer of common haplotypes into V.riviniana from both V.reichenbachiana and hypothetically the other, now extinct, parental species. AFLP analysis showed low overall genetic diversity of both species, with V.riviniana showing higher among-population diversity. None of the morphologically designated hybrid populations had additive AFLP polymorphisms that would have indicated recent hybridisation. Also, kinship coefficients between both species did not indicate gene flow. V.riviniana showed significant population subdivision and significant isolation by distance, in contrast to V.reichenbachiana. The results indicate lack of gene flow between species, high influence of selfing on genetic variability, as well as probably only localised introgression toward V.riviniana.	2017	10.1111/plb.12571		Plants			TRUE	FALSE		FALSE	NOT INCLUDED; structure, PCA etc (did not find evidence for introgression)		FALSE	
Jiang, Jiefeng; Mou, Tongmin; Yu, Huihui; Zhou, Fasong	Molecular breeding of thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines of rice for blast resistance using Pi2 gene	RICE	Background: Blast disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the big problems in rice production in China, especially for high yield hybrid varieties made from a two-line system in which thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines are used. In this study, we report the introgression of a rice blast resistance gene Pi2 from VE6219 into C815S, an elite rice TGMS line, leading to the development of blast resistant TGMS lines through marker assisted selection (MAS) and phenotypic selection approaches. Results: Four new TGMS lines with blast resistance gene Pi2 were developed from C815S (an elite TGMS line susceptible to the blast, used as recurrent parent) and VE6219 (a blast resistant line harboring Pi2, used as donor parent). The pathogenicity assays inoculated with 53 blast prevalent isolates in glasshouse showed that the blast resistant frequency of the four TGMS lines was 94.3%-98.1% that is equivalent to blast resistant donor parent VE6219. The field evaluation of the new lines and hybrids made from them at a blast epidemic site also showed high resistant levels against the blast. The genetic background of the newly developed TGMS lines were examined using a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array (RICE6K) that turned out more than 83% of the genomic markers were derived from the recurrent parent. The critical temperature points of fertility-sterility alteration of the new TGMS lines were between 22 degrees C and 23 degrees C of daily mean temperature, which is similar to that of C815S. The complete male sterility under natural growth conditions at Wuhan last more than 80 days. Their agronomic and grain quality traits meet the requirement for two-line hybrid rice production. Conclusions: The broad-spectrum and durable rice blast resistant gene Pi2 was introgressed into the elite TGMS line C815S background. The newly developed TGMS lines can be practically used for two-line hybrid rice breeding and must play an important role in sustainable rice production in China.	2015	10.1186/s12284-015-0048-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	experimental cross/plants	FALSE			FALSE	
Cara, Nicolas; Soledad Ferrer, Maria; Williams Masuelli, Ricardo; Lucila Camadro, Elsa; Federico Marfil, Carlos	Epigenetic consequences of interploidal hybridisation in synthetic and natural interspecific potato hybrids	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	Interploidal hybridisation can generate changes in plant chromosome numbers, which might exert effects additional to the expected due to genome merger per se (that is genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic novelties). Wild potatoes are suitable to address this question in an evolutionary context. To this end, we performed genetic (AFLP and single sequence repeart (SSR)), epigenetic (MSAP), and cytological comparisons in: (1) natural populations of the diploid cytotype of the hybrid taxonomic species Solanum x rechei (2n = 2x, 3x) and its parental species, the triploid cytotype of Solanum microdontum (2n = 2x, 3x) and Solanum kurtzianum (2n = 2x); and (2) newly synthesised intraploidal (2x x 2x) and interploidal (3x x 2x) S. microdontum x S. kurtzianum hybrids. Aneuploidy was detected in S. x rechei and the synthetic interploidal progeny; this phenomenon might have originated the significantly higher number of methylation changes observed in the interploidal vs the intraploidal hybrids. The wide epigenetic variability induced by interploidal hybridisation is consistent with the novel epigenetic pattern established in S. x rechei compared to its parental species in nature. These results suggest that aneuploid potato lineages can persist throughout the short term, and possibly medium term, and that differences in parental ploidy resulting in aneuploidy are an additional source of epigenetic variation.	2019	10.1111/nph.15706		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Iqball, Muhammad Zafar; Cheng, Mingjun; Su, Yuegu; Li, Yang; Jiang, Weiming; Li, Huaxiong; Zhao, Yanli; Wen, Xiaodong; Zhang, Lei; Ali, Asif; Rong, Tingzhao; Tang, Qilin	Allopolyploidization facilitates gene flow and speciation among corn, Zea perennis and Tripsacum dactyloides	PLANTA	Main conclusionTripsacum dactyloides is closely related to Zea mays since Zea perennis and the MTP tri- species hybrid have four possible reproductive modes.Eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides L.) and tetraploid perennial teosinte (Zea perennis) are well known to possess genes conferring resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses as well as adaptation to flood and aluminum toxic soils. However, plant breeders have been hampered to utilize these and other beneficial traits for maize improvement due to sterility in their hybrids. By crossing a tetraploid maize-inbred line x T. dactyloides, a female fertile hybrid was produced that was crossed with Z. perennis to yield a tri-genomic female fertile hybrid, which was backcrossed with diploid maize to produce BC1 and BC2. The tri-genomic hybrid provided a new way to transfer genetic material from both species into maize by utilizing conventional plant breeding methods. On the basis of cytogenetic observations using multi-color genomic in situ hybridization, the progenies were classified into four groups, in which chromosomes could be scaled both up and down with ease to produce material for varying breeding and genetic purposes via apomixis or sexual reproduction. In the present study, pathways were found to recover maize and to obtain specific translocations as well as a speedy recovery of the T. dactyloides-maize addition line in a second backcross generation. However, phenotypes of the recovered maize were in most cases far from maize as a result of genetic load from T. dactyloides and Z. perennis, and could not be directly used as a maize-inbred line but could serve as an intermediate material for maize improvement. A series of hybrids was produced (having varying chromosome number, constitution, and translocations) with agronomic traits from all three parental species. The present study provides an application of overcoming the initial interspecific barriers among these species. Moreover, T. dactyloides is closely related to Z. mays L. ssp. mays since Z. perennis and the MTP tri- species hybrid have four possible reproductive modes.	2019	10.1007/s00425-019-03136-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Pastova, Ladislava; Belyayev, Alexander; Mahelka, Vaclav	Molecular cytogenetic characterisation of Elytrigia xmucronata, a natural hybrid of E. intermedia and E. repens (Triticeae, Poaceae)	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Interspecific hybridisation resulting in polyploidy is one of the major driving forces in plant evolution. Here, we present data from the molecular cytogenetic analysis of three cytotypes of Elytrigia xmucronata using sequential fluorescence (5S rDNA, 18S rDNA and pSc119.2 probes) and genomic in situ hybridisation (four genomic probes of diploid taxa, i.e., Aegilops, Dasypyrum, Hordeum and Pseudoroegneria). Results: The concurrent presence of Hordeum (descended from E. repens) and Dasypyrum + Aegilops (descended from E. intermedia) chromosome sets in all cytotypes of E. xmucronata confirmed the assumed hybrid origin of the analysed plants. The following different genomic constitutions were observed for E. xmucronata. Hexaploid plants exhibited three chromosome sets from Pseudoroegneria and one chromosome set each from Aegilops, Hordeum and Dasypyrum. Heptaploid plants harboured the six chromosome sets of the hexaploid plants and an additional Pseudoroegneria chromosome set. Nonaploid cytotypes differed in their genomic constitutions, reflecting different origins through the fusion of reduced and unreduced gametes. The hybridisation patterns of repetitive sequences (5S rDNA, 18S rDNA, and pSc119.2) in E. xmucronata varied between and within cytotypes. Chromosome alterations that were not identified in the parental species were found in both heptaploid and some nonaploid plants. Conclusions: The results confirmed that both homoploid hybridisation and heteroploid hybridisation that lead to the coexistence of four different haplomes within single hybrid genomes occur in Elytrigia allopolyploids. The chromosomal alterations observed in both heptaploid and some nonaploid plants indicated that genome restructuring occurs during and/or after the hybrids arose. Moreover, a specific chromosomal translocation detected in one of the nonaploids indicated that it was not a primary hybrid. Therefore, at least some of the hybrids are fertile. Hybridisation in Triticeae allopolyploids clearly and significantly contributes to genomic diversity. Different combinations of parental haplomes coupled with chromosomal alterations may result in the establishment of unique lineages, thus providing raw material for selection.	2019	10.1186/s12870-019-1806-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytotype evolution	FALSE			FALSE	
Abbasi, F. M.; Ahmad, H.; Perveen, F.; Inamullah; Sajid, M.; Brar, D. S.	Assessment of genomic relationship between Oryza sativa and Oryza australinesis	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY	The genomic relationship between Oryza sativa (2n = 24 AA) and Oryza australinesis (2n = 24 EE) has not been established. Genomic relationship between these two species was assessed by using three strategies: genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), meiotic chromosome pairing, pollen and spikelet sterility. The hybrid was produced between these two species at the International Rice Research Institute using embryo rescue technique. The chromosome pairing was examined in pollen mother cells of O. australinesis, O. sativa and the hybrid between O. sativa and O. australinesis. The hybrid was highly sterile with pollen stain ability being 0.05%. Both parents showed regular meiosis with normal chromosome pairing. The F1 hybrid exhibited limited chromosome pairing. On an average, 0-4 bivalents and 16-24 univalents were recorded at metaphase-1. The most frequent configuration was two bivalent and twenty univalent. The chromosomes of O. australiensis appeared larger and darkly stained. For genomic in situ hybridization, genomic DNA from O. australiensis was used as probe for the mitotic and meiotic chromosomes of the hybrid between O. sativa and O. australiensis. GISH revealed unequivocal discrimination of O. australiensis chromosomes that appeared yellow due to hybridization signal from O. sativa chromosomes that fluoresced red due to counterstaining with propidium iodide (PI). No cross hybridization was examined between the labeled genomic DNA of O. australiensis and the chromosomes of O. sativa. The paired chromosomes were discriminated as autosyndetic and allosyndetic pairing. Meiotic and mitotic chromosomes of the O. australiensis and O. sativa, in the hybrid were discriminated by GISH for the first time. Results showed that both genomes were highly divergent.	2010			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics/manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Genomic affinity between Oryza sativa and Oryza brachyantha as revealed by in situ hybridization and chromosome pairing	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY	Genomic affinity between Oryza sativa (2n = 24 AA), and Oryza brachyantha (2n = 24 FF) was assessed by using three strategies: genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), meiotic chromosome pairing, pollen and spikelet sterility. The chromosome pairing was examined in pollen mother cells of O. brachyantha, O. sativa and the hybrid between O. sativa and O. brachyantha. The hybrid was highly sterile with no pollen stain ability. Both parents showed regular meiosis with normal chromosome pairing. The F1 hybrid exhibited limited chromosome pairing. On an average, 0-2 bivalents and 20-24 univalents were recorded at metaphase-1 and 0 - 1 univalent at diakinesis. The most frequent configuration was two bivalents and twenty univalent. The meiosis was highly irregular showing unequal distribution of chromosomes at anaphase, formation of multipolar bodies and variation in the cell cycle of both genomes. GISH revealed unequivocal discrimination of O. brachyantha chromosomes as appeared red from O. sativa chromosomes that fluoresced yellow. No cross hybridization was examined between the labeled genomic DNA of O. brachyantha and the chromosomes of O. sativa. Mitotic chromosomes of O. brachyantha and O. sativa, in the hybrid, were discriminated by GISH. High sterility in this hybrid could be due to abnormal meiosis and lack of pairing.	2010			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Introduction of alien genes requires hybridization followed by meiotic pairing and recombination between the chromosomes of cultivated and wild species. Attempts have been made to visualize the genomic constitution of wide-cross derivatives. Genomic in situ hybridization was used to detect Oryza australiensis chromosomes and introgressed segment from O. australiensis into the Oryza sativa background. Genomic DNA from O. australiensis was labeled with biotin-14-dATP and hybridized to the homologous chromosomes in hybrids, back cross progenies, monosomic alien addition line (MAAL) and introgression line. The probe hybridization fluoresced green and non-labeled O. sativa chromosomes appeared red due to counterstaining with propidium iodide (PI). This differential painting of chromosomes unequivocally detected the O. australiensis chromatin introgressed into the O. sativa genome. The probe produced uniform labeling pattern over the entire length of all the O. australiensis chromosomes. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) detected 12 O. australiensis chromosomes in the hybrid, O. sativa x O. australiensis in BC1 progenies, and a single chromosome in MAAL. Small segment of O. australiensis was localized on the chromosome 12 of the introgression line. However, results showed that GISH is a powerful technique to be used as an aid in selecting segregating progenies.	2010			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Acquadro, Alberto; Barchi, Lorenzo; Gramazio, Pietro; Portis, Ezio; Vilanova, Santiago; Comino, Cinzia; Plazas, Mariola; Prohens, Jaime; Lanteri, Sergio	Coding SNPs analysis highlights genetic relationships and evolution pattern in eggplant complexes	PLOS ONE	Brinjal (Solanum melongena), scarlet (S. aethiopicum) and gboma (S. macrocarpon) eggplants are three Old World domesticates. The genomic DNA of a collection of accessions belonging to the three cultivated species, along with a representation of various wild relatives, was characterized for the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a genotype-by-sequencing approach. A total of 210 million useful reads were produced and were successfully aligned to the reference eggplant genome sequence. Out of the 75,399 polymorphic sites identified among the 76 entries in study, 12,859 were associated with coding sequence. A genetic relationships analysis, supported by the output of the FastSTRUCTURE software, identified four major sub-groups as present in the germplasm panel. The first of these clustered S. aethiopicum with its wild ancestor S. anguivi; the second, S. melongena, its wild progenitor S. insanum, and its relatives S. incanum, S. lichtensteinii and S. linneanum; the third, S. macrocarpon and its wild ancestor S. dasyphyllum; and the fourth, the New World species S. sisymbriifolium, S. torvum and S. elaeagnifolium. By applying a hierarchical FastSTRUCTURE analysis on partitioned data, it was also possible to resolve the ambiguous membership of the accessions of S. campylacanthum, S. violaceum, S. lidii, S. vespertilio and S. tomentsum, as well as to genetically differentiate the three species of New World Origin. A principal coordinates analysis performed both on the entire germplasm panel and also separately on the entries belonging to sub-groups revealed a clear separation among species, although not between each of the domesticates and their respective wild ancestors. There was no clear differentiation between either distinct cultivar groups or different geographical provenance. Adopting various approaches to analyze SNP variation provided support for interpretation of results. The genotyping-by-sequencing approach showed to be highly efficient for both quantifying genetic diversity and establishing genetic relationships among and within cultivated eggplants and their wild relatives. The relevance of these results to the evolution of eggplants, as well as to their genetic improvement, is discussed.	2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0180774		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

To elucidate this question, we analyzed advanced generations of intergeneric hybrids, derived from an initial pollination of known oilseed rape varieties (Brassica napus, AACC, 2n = 38) by a local population of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum, RrRr, 2n = 18). After five generations of recurrent pollination, 307 G5 plants with a chromosome number similar to wild radish were genotyped using 105 B. napus specific markers well distributed along the chromosomes. They revealed that 49.8% of G5 plants carried at least one B. napus genomic region. According to the frequency of B. napus markers (0-28%), four classes were defined: Class 1 (near zero frequency), with 75 markers covering similar to 70% of oilseed rape genome; Class 2 (low frequency), with 20 markers located on 11 genomic regions; Class 3 (high frequency), with eight markers on three genomic regions; and Class 4 (higher frequency), with two adjacent markers detected on A10. Therefore, some regions of the oilseed rape genome are more prone than others to be introgressed into wild radish. Inheritance and growth of plant progeny revealed that genomic regions of oilseed rape could be stably introduced into wild radish and variably impact the plant fitness (plant height and seed number). Our results pinpoint that novel technologies enabling the targeted insertion of transgenes should select genomic regions that are less likely to be introgressed into the weed genome, thereby reducing gene flow.	2017	10.1534/genetics.117.201715		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Adamowski, Eleniza De Victor; Pagliarini, Maria Suely; Do Valle, Cacilda Borges	Meiotic behaviour in three interspecific three-way hybrids between Brachiaria ruziziensis and B. brizantha (Poacene : Paniceae)	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	The meiotic behaviour of three three-way interspecific promising hybrids (H17, H27, and H34) was evaluated. These hybrids resulted from the crosses between B. ruziziensis X B. brizantha and crossed to another B. brizantha. Two half-sib hybrids (H27 and H34) presented an aneuploid chromosome number (2n = 4x = 33), whereas hybrid H17 was a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 36), as expected. Chromosome paired predominantly as multivalents suggesting that genetic recombination and introgression of specific target genes from B. brizantha into B. ruziziensis can be expected. Arrangement of parental genomes in distinct metaphase plates was observed in H27 and H34, which have different male genitors. Hybrids H 17 and H34 have the same male genitor, but did not display this abnormality. In H 17, abnormalities were more frequent from anaphase H, when many laggard chromosomes appeared, suggesting that each genome presented a different genetic control for meiotic phase timing. Despite the phylogenetic proximity among these two species, these three hybrids presented a high frequency of meiotic abnormalities, mainly those related to irregular chromosome segregation typical of polyploids, H34, 69.1%; H27, 56.1% and H17, 44.9%. From the accumulated results obtained through cytological studies in Brachiaria hybrids, it is evident that cytogenetical analysis is of prime importance in determining which genotypes can continue in the process of cultivar development and which can be successfully used in the breeding. Hybrids with high frequency of meiotic abnormalities can seriously compromise seed production, a key trait in assuring adoption of a new apomictic cultivar of Brachiaria for pasture formation.	2008			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Genomic composition and yield heterosis of the partial inter-specific hybrid rice between Oryza sativa L. and Oryza glaberrima Steud.	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE	Development of partial inter-specific hybrid (PIH) rice is a promising approach for exploiting inter-specific heterosis between Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa. In the present study, the relationship between genetic distance (GD) of parental lines and yield performance of the PIHs was assessed using partial diallel crosses between three indica male sterile lines and 14 introgression lines (ILs) with different fragments of O. glaberrima genes. Twenty two out of the 42 PIHs expressed positive heterobeltiosis (i.e., the F-I hybrid showed superiority over the better parent in the target trait) for panicle number, spikelet number, thousand grain weight and grain yield/plant. The proportion of O. glaberrima genome in the ILs ranged from 0.03 to 0.41, as revealed by 16 informative simple sequence repeat markers. Significant positive correlations were found between the proportion of O. glaberrima genome of the ILs and the GD between the ILs and the three different female parents. Heterosis of spikelet number per panicle in the hybrids was positively proportional with the O. glaberrima genome content of the parental ILs, while that of fertile grain percentage was negatively proportional to the O. glaberrima genome proportion. On average, the PIHs with higher grain yield and highest heterobeltiosis were obtained from the ILs carrying between 0.15 and 0.30 of O. glaberrima genome. The results indicated that a small proportion (<0.15) of the O. glaberrima genome in the ILs might limit heterosis expression of spikelet number per panicle, while a very large proportion (>0.30) of the O. glaberrima genome decreased the grain filling percentage in the PIHs, thus an intermediate range of O. glaberrima genome proportion should be more suitable for breeding heterotic PIHs. The exploitation of inter-specific heterosis between O. glaberrima and O. sativa has potential value for heterotic breeding in rice.	2016	10.1017/S002185961500026X		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Ahmadikhah, Asadollah; Mirarab, Mehdi; Pahlevani, Mohammad Hadi; Nayyeripasand, Leila	Marker-Assisted Backcrossing to Develop an Elite Cytoplasmic Male Sterility Line in Rice	PLANT GENOME	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a cornerstone of hybrid production in many crops. In three-line hybrid systems, use of CMS, maintainer, and fertility restorer lines is necessary for production of hybrid seeds. Limited resources of CMS and low variation of CMS lines cause genetic vulnerability to pathogens. Therefore, diversifying the CMS sources is indispensible for a sustainable production system of hybrid seed. In this study, we attempted for the first time to transfer CMS into maintainer line Yosen B in restricted generations using the marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) method. The resultant F-1 hybrid of IR68897 A/Yosen B cross was backcrossed to Yosen B, and CMS plants in each backcross generation (from BC1F1 to BC3F1) were selected based on phenotyping test and MABC. Molecular assessment of backcross progenies was conducted using a mitochondrial CMS-specific marker and 34 polymorphic nuclear simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers in early generations (from BC1F1 to BC2F1) and was continued using 9 additional SSRs and 82 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers in BC3F1. A MABC strategy could successfully recover the recurrent parent genome (RPG) in BC3F1 generation, and decreased heterozygosity of final CMS plants. Restorability test with known wild-abortive restorer lines (viz. IR36 and IR24) showed that combination of Yosen A x IR24 could produce highly fertile F-1 hybrid. Evaluation of some important agronomic traits of the final CMS line (BC4F1) at field condition showed that it was comparable to the original maintainer fertile counterpart. Phenotypic and marker-assisted selections could considerably decrease the time needed for full recovery of RPG so that final CMS line could show a high similarity to original fertile counterpart.	2015	10.3835/plantgenome2014.07.0031		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ahmed, Fahim; Rafii, Mohd Y.; Ismail, Mohd Razi; Juraimi, Abdul Shukor; Rahim, Harun Abdul; Tanweer, Fatah Abro; Latif, Mohammad Abdul	Recurrent parent genome recovery in different populations with the introgression of Sub1 gene from a cross between MR219 and Swarna-Sub1	EUPHYTICA	Recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery is the most important step of marker assisted backcross breeding. This breeding approach is used to develop new varieties by inserting a particular gene of interest into the background of a modern variety, and removing undesirable segments linked with the target allele, which can survive after many generations of backcrossing. The marker assisted backcrossing technique is the most effective way to minimize the limitation of conventional breeding, and recover the parental genome within 2-3 generations. MR219, A modern rice variety of Malaysia (susceptible to submergence) was crossed with a high-yielding submergence tolerant variety Swarna-Sub1 (donor) to produce a new submergence tolerant rice variety. Foreground selection for the sub1 gene was done using tightly linked markers. Estimation of RPG recovery was conducted in earlier generations with previously screened polymorphic SSR markers. A total of 385 SSR markers were tested to identify the polymorphism between the parents and 88 of them found to be polymorphic. Background analysis revealed 65.55-77.8 and 78.79-95.5 % recovery in BC1F1 and BC2F1 generations, respectively. In the BC2F2 generation the average RPG recovery was 95.37 % and that for the selected plant was 96.3 %. This study revealed the usefulness of marker assisted backcrossing for the quick recovery of a parental genome in a backcrossing population.	2016	10.1007/s10681-015-1554-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Aitken, K. S.; Li, J. -C.; Jackson, P.; Piperidis, G.; McIntyre, C. L.	AFLP analysis of genetic diversity within Saccharum officinarum and comparison with sugarcane cultivars	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH	Molecular diversity among 421 clones of cultivated sugarcane and wild relatives was analysed using AFLP markers. Of these clones, 270 were Saccharum officinarum and 151 were either cultivars produced by the Australian breeding program or important parents used in the breeding program. The S. of. cinarum clones were obtained from a collection that contained clones from all the major regions where S. of. cinarum is grown. Five AFLP primer combinations generated 657 markers ofwhich 614 were polymorphic. All clones contained a large number of markers; a result of the polyploid nature and heterozygosity of the genome. S. of. cinarum clones from New Guinea displayed greater diversity than S. of. cinarum clones from other regions. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that New Guinea is the centre of origin of this species. The S. of. cinarum clones from Hawaii and Fiji formed a separate group and may correspond to clones that have been introgressed with other members of the ` Saccharum complex'. Greater diversity was found in the cultivars than in the S. of. cinarum clones due to the introgression of S. spontaneum chromatin. These cultivars clustered as expected based on pedigree. The major contribution of clones QN66- 2008 and Nco310 to Australian sugarcane cultivars divided the cultivars into 2 main groups. Although only a fewS. of. cinarum clones are known to have been used in the breeding of current cultivars, about 90% of markers present in the S. of. cinarum clone collection ( 2n= 80) were also present in the cultivar collection. This suggests that most of the observed genetic diversity in S. of. cinarum has been captured in Australian sugarcane germplasm.	2006	10.1071/AR05391		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	estimated diversity of sugarcane lines, including introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Aitken, Karen; Li, Jingchuan; Piperidis, George; Cai Qing; Fan Yuanhong; Jackson, Phillip	Worldwide Genetic Diversity of the Wild Species Saccharum spontaneum and Level of Diversity Captured within Sugarcane Breeding Programs	CROP SCIENCE	Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is grown in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and produces 80% of the world's sucrose primarily for human consumption but is increasingly used as a feedstock for biofuel. Commercial cultivars are hybrids between two species, Saccharum officinarum L. and S. spontaneum L. Saccharum spontaneum is the wild species with generally low sucrose levels and is used to introgress traits such as high yield, increased disease resistance, and ratooning. Molecular markers generated across the Saccharum genome were used to analyze diversity across 430 S. spontaneum accessions collected from 21 different countries and 255 cultivars from two breeding programs. A total of 724 markers were used for principle coordinate and cluster analysis, which revealed two main clusters that corresponded to accessions collected north or south of the Tropic of Cancer. The majority of the accessions clustered according to country of origin. Genetic similarity ranged from 0.25 to 0.54, with the highest diversity in accessions collected in Indonesia, followed by China, India, and Thailand, and the lowest in the Philippines. The diversity in the cultivar collection was lower than in the S. spontaneum accessions, as expected. Despite the low number of S. spontaneum clones used for breeding varieties, 51 to 80% of markers were captured in the breeding populations, although many at a low frequency. This is due to the high heterozygosity of sugarcane related to high ploidy and the introgression programs that have been performed in a number of sugarcane breeding programs. The genetic similarity was highest within the breeding program, and there remains large amounts of unexplored diversity in the wild germplasm. Diversity analysis could be used to guide the selection of wild S. spontaneum accessions, along with phenotypic data for introgression into breeding programs to increase genetic diversity.	2018	10.2135/cropsci2017.06.0339		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Two allooctoploids (RRAAAACC and AACCRRCC) were produced from each F, hybrid by chromosome doubling. From successive backcrosses to B. napus, MAL plants were first obtained in BC2, generation and the R. sativus-derived chromosome was identified by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The nine chromosomes of R-genome in the MAL plants were clearly classified by each chromosome-specific RAPD markers. As a result, alloplasmic (radish cytoplasm) B. napus-R. sativus MAL having 8 types (a-i, except for h-type) and autoplasmic (rape cytoplasm) MAL with complete 9 types (a-i) were obtained in BC3 and BC4 generations. These alloplasmic and autoplasmic MAL plants were showed differences in their morphological, physiological and cytogenetical characters. From the survey of favorable traits, it was suggested that the a-type had fertility restoring gene(s) for male sterility in alloplasmic line and the g-type had a gene controlling white color petal. These two MALs are useful materials for exploring agronomic traits located on each chromosome of radish and for promoting the introgression of promising radish gene(s) to B. napus.	2009	10.1270/jsbbs.59.109		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Akond, A. S. M. G. Masum; Watanabe, N.; Furuta, Y.	Comparative genetic diversity of Triticum aestivum-Triticum polonicum introgression lines with long glume and Triticum petropavlovskyi by AFLP-based assessment	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	Genetic diversity of a set of introgression lines of Triticum aestivum L./T. polonicum L. with long glume and T. petropavlovskyi Udacz. et Migusch. were analyzed by Amplified Fragments Length Polymorphism (AFLP). Small-scale bulk breeding method was applied throughout until F-6 generation to develop the introgression lines. Thirty-eight hexapolid F-7 plants with long glume phenotype and their parents were subjected to AFLP analysis by four primer combinations. A total of 47 polymorphic loci were detected between the parents, 15 of them were introgressed across the 38 lines. It was hypothesized that approximately 50% of A or B genomes associated polymorphic loci were introgressed. The variation of introgression lines was limited within the diversity between their parents, T. aestivum L. cv. Novosibirskaya 67 (N67) and T. polonicum L. cv. IC12196. N67 was closer to 38 introgression lines than that of IC12196. The UPGMA cluster and principal coordinate analysis (PCO) grouping showed 0.84 to 0.98 similarity values between N67 and the introgression lines. Eleven T. petropavlovskyi accessions were distinguished from introgression lines with UPGMA clusters and PCO groupings, and T. petropavlovskyi was located between the introgressions lines and IC12196. Several introgression lines resembled with T. petropavlovskyi for awning and glume length. The genetic variation among 38 introgression lines was much wider than that of T. petropavlovskyi. We concluded that T. petropavlovskyi was established by intensive selection of hybrid between T. aestivum/T. polonicum.	2008	10.1007/s10722-007-9221-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Genetic Introgression from Glycine tomentella to Soybean to Increase Seed Yield	CROP SCIENCE	Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeding in the United States currently relies on a narrow genetic base. Glycine tomentella Hayata (2n = 78), native to Australia, is a perennial relative in the tertiary gene pool of soybean. No effort has been devoted to using this species to increase seed yield. The objectives of this research were (i) to identify high-yielding lines derived from backcrosses between the soybean cultivar Dwight (2n = 40) and G. tomentella PI 441001 (2n = 78) and to compare their agronomic performance with that of the recurrent parent, and (ii) to determine associations between G. tomentella introgressions and agronomic traits. PI 441001 was crossed to Dwight and immature seed rescue was used to produce a sterile F-1 plant. Amphidiploid plants (2n = 118) were produced by treating the F-1 hybrid with colchicine. Amphidiploid plants were backcrossed to Dwight and a series of backcrosses were made to obtain lines with 2n = 40 chromosomes, which were self-fertile and genetically stable. Preliminary yield testing was used to select 180 lines in maturity groups II, III, and IV that had yields greater than or less than that of the recurrent parent. Yield data collected in two replication tests at six to eight locations in 2013 and 2014 identified experimental lines in all three maturity groups that were higher yielding than the recurrent parent. All experimental and parental lines were genotyped, revealing an average of 1% G. tomentella introgression. Significant associations were detected between G. tomentella introgressions and time of flowering, height, lodging, and yield.	2018	10.2135/cropsci2017.07.0445		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Albarouki, Emad; Peterson, Angela	Molecular and morphological characterization of Crataegus L. species (Rosaceae) in southern Syria	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	The systematics of the genus Crataegus ( Rosaceae) have been considered problematic owing to the fact that hybridization, introgression, polyploidy and apomixis may occur in this genus. A study of the Crataegus species from the Arab mountains, Sweida Province, Syria, has been undertaken based on both plastid DNA sequences ( trn L-trnF, psb A-trn H) and morphological data. In the investigated region, three morphologically distinguishable Crataegus species: C. azarolus var. aronia L., C. x sinaica Boiss. ssp. sinaica and C. monogyna var. monogyna Jacq. were investigated. Crataegus azarolus can be clearly distinguished morphologically from C. monogyna by the colour, size and structure of fruits, the number of pyrenes, the flowering and ripening time, the density of thorns, the tree shape and also the leaf shape. According to our morphological data, in Syria, C. coloursinaica is variable and could represent a hybrid of C. azarolus x C. monogyna; the cp DNA sequence analysis showed sequences corresponding to C. monogyna as the plausible mother of the hybrid.

Amidou, N'Diaye; Michel, Noirot; Serge, Hamon; Valerie, Poncet	Genetic basis of species differentiation between Coffea liberica Hiern and C-canephora Pierre: Analysis of an interspecific cross	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	The phenotypic and genetic differentiation between the two related Coffea species (C. liberica Hiern and C. canephora Pierre) was examined. These species differed markedly in terms of leaf, inflorescence, fruit and seed characters. A genetic map of the interspecific cross Coffea liberica x C. canephora was constructed on the basis of 72 BC1 hybrids. Eighty-three AFLP markers, four inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and five microsatellites corresponding to Coffea liberica species-specific markers were mapped into 16 linkage groups. The total length of the map was 1502.5 cM, with an average of 16.3 cM between markers and an estimated genome coverage of 81%. The two species were evaluated relative to 16 quantitative traits and found to be significantly different for 15 of them. Eight QTLs were detected, associated with variations in petiole length, leaf area, number of flowers per inflorescence, fruit shape, fruit disc diameter, seed shape and seed length. Results on segregation distortion and the under-representation of particular markers were interpreted in terms of genome differentiation. The implications for the introgression of QTLs involved in advantageous morphological traits (number of flowers per inflorescence, fruit and seed shape) are discussed.	2007	10.1007/s10722-006-9195-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
An, Hongzhou; Hu, Mei; Li, Pengfei; Geng, Guangdong; Zhang, Qingqin; Zhang, Suqin	Chromosomal Behavior during Meiosis in the Progeny of Triticum timopheevii x Hexaploid Wild Oat	PLOS ONE	The meiotic behavior of pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the F-2 and F-3 progeny from Triticum timopheevii x hexaploid wild oat was investigated by cytological analysis and sequential C-banding-genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in the present study. A cytological analysis showed that the chromosome numbers of the F-2 and F-3 progeny ranged from 28 to 41. A large number of univalents, lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges and micronuclei were found at the metaphase I, anaphase I, anaphase II and tetrad stages in the F-2 and F-3 progeny. The averages of univalents were 3.50 and 2.73 per cell, and those of lagging chromosomes were 3.37 and 1.87 in the F-2 and F-3 progeny, respectively. The PMC meiotic indices of the F-2 and F-3 progeny were 12.22 and 20.34, respectively, indicating considerable genetic instability. A sequential C-banding-GISH analysis revealed that some chromosomes and fragments from the hexaploid wild oat were detected at metaphase I and anaphase I in the progeny, showing that the progeny were of true intergeneric hybrid origin. The alien chromosomes 6A, 7A, 3C and 2D were lost during transmission from F-2 to F-3. In addition, partial T. timopheevii chromosomes appeared in the form of univalents or lagging chromosomes, which might result from large genome differences between the parents, and the wild oat chromosome introgression interfered with the wheat homologues' normally pairing.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0126398		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Apolinarska, B.; Wisniewska, H.; Wojciechowska, B.	Aegilops-rye amphiploids and substitution rye used for introgression of genetic material into rye (Secale cereale L.)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS	The valuable genes of Aegilops biuncialis, Ae. ovata, Ae. kotschyi, and Ae. variabilis were transferred to rye, by crossing Aegilops-rye amphiploids with tetraploid and diploid substitution rye. The C-banded karyotype of the BC(1) and BC(2) generations of amphiploids with 4x substitution rye and BC(1) with 2x substitution rye showed great variation in chromosome number and composition. In the BC(1) generation of amphiploids with 4x and 2x substitution rye, seed set success rate and germination rate varied depending on origin. However, plant sterility in all cross combinations of amphiploids with 4x and 2x substitution rye resulted in their elimination from further experiments in the BC(3) and BC(2) generations, respectively. In backcrosses of 4x substitution rye with amphiploids Ae. variabilis x rye 4x, fertile 4x rye plants containing Aegilops chromatin were produced in the BC(2) generation.	2010	10.1007/BF03208871		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Arora, Kanika; Panda, Kusuma Kumari; Mittal, Shikha; Mallikarjuna, Mallana Gowdra; Thirunavukkarasu, Nepolean	In Silico Characterization and Functional Validation of Cell Wall Modification Genes Imparting Waterlogging Tolerance in Maize	BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOLOGY INSIGHTS	Cell wall modification (CWM) promotes the formation of aerenchyma in roots under waterlogging conditions as an adaptive mechanism. Lysigenous aerenchyma formation in roots improves oxygen transfer in plants, which highlights the importance of CWM as a focal point in waterlogging stress tolerance. We investigated the structural and functional compositions of CWM genes and their expression patterns under waterlogging conditions in maize. Cell wall modification genes were identified for 3 known waterlogging-responsive cis-acting regulatory elements, namely, GC motif, anaerobic response elements, and G-box, and 2 unnamed elements. Structural motifs mapped in CWM genes were represented in genes regulating waterlogging stress-tolerant pathways, including fermentation, glycolysis, programmed cell death, and reactive oxygen species signaling. The highly aligned regions of characterized and uncharacterized CWM proteins revealed common structural domains amongst them. Membrane spanning regions present in the protein structures revealed transmembrane activity of CWM proteins in the plant cell wall. Cell wall modification proteins had interacted with ethylene-responsive pathway regulating genes (E3 ubiquitin ligases RNG finger and F-box) in a maize protein-protein interaction network. Cell wall modification genes had also coexpressed with energy metabolism, programmed cell death, and reactive oxygen species signaling, regulating genes in a single coexpression cluster. These configurations of CWM genes can be used to modify the protein expression in maize under waterlogging stress condition. Our study established the importance of CWM genes in waterlogging tolerance, and these genes can be used as candidates in introgression breeding and genome editing experiments to impart tolerance in maize hybrids.	2017	10.1177/1177932217747277		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Arrigo, Nils; de La Harpe, Marylaure; Litsios, Glenn; Zozomova-Lihova, Judita; Spaniel, Stanislav; Marhold, Karol; Barker, Michael S.; Alvarez, Nadir	Is hybridization driving the evolution of climatic niche in Alyssum montanum?	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: After decades of interest, the contribution of hybridization to ecological diversification remains unclear. Hybridization is a potent source of novelty, but nascent hybrid lineages must overcome reproductive and ecological competition from their parental species. Here, we assess whether hybrid speciation is advantageous over alternative modes of speciation, by comparing the geographical and ecological ranges and climatic niche evolutionary rates of stabilized allopolyploid vs. autopolyploids in the Alyssum montanum species complex. METHODS: We combined an extensive review of studies addressing the systematics and genetic diversity of A. montanum s.l., with flow cytometry and cloning of nuclear markers, to establish the ploidy level and putative hybrid nature of 205 populations. The respective geographic distribution and climatic niche evolution dynamics of the allo- and autopolyploids were investigated using multivariate analyses and comparative phylogenetic approaches. KEY RESULTS: As expected by theory, allopolyploids occur mainly along contact zones and are generally spatially overlapping with their diploid counterparts. However, they demonstrate higher rates of niche evolution and expand into different climatic conditions than those of their diploid congeners. In contrast, autopolyploids show lower rates of niche evolution, occupy ecological niches similar to their ancestors and are restricted to less competitive and peripheral geographic areas. CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization thus seems advantageous by promoting ecological niche evolution and more readily allowing escape from competitive exclusion.	2016	10.3732/ajb.1500368		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	comparison of allo vs auto polyploids; did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Atri, Chhaya; Kaur, Beerpal; Sharma, Sanjula; Gandhi, Nikita; Verma, Heena; Goyal, Anna; Banga, S. S.	Substituting nuclear genome of Brassica juncea (L.) Czern & Coss. In cytoplasmic background of Brassica fruticulosa results in cytoplasmic male sterility	EUPHYTICA	Backcross substitution of Brassica juncea (2n = 36; AABB) nucleus into the cytoplasm of a wild crucifer, Brassica fruticulosa helped in development of a new cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system. Male sterility was complete, stable, and expressed as rudimentary anthers containing sterile pollen grains. There was no impact on other floral as well as vegetative characters. All the natural B. juncea genotypes evaluated maintained the sterility. Gene for fertility restoration could be successfully introgressed from cytoplasm donor species. Genomic in situ hybridization studies revealed B. fruticulosa intogression in at least three chromosomes of the recipient species. Genetic studies carried out on F-1, F-2 and test cross progenies derived from hybridizing cytoplasmic male sterile and fertility restoring genotypes revealed a monogenic dominant control for the fertility restoration. Bulked segregant analysis with 588 SSR and 30 ISSR primers allowed identification of putative primers associated with fertility restoration. Co-segregation analysis of ten such primers with Rff gene revealed that Rf was flanked by two markers, namely cnu_m316 and nia_ m22, which were located 27.1 (LOD = 3.0) and 19.7 cM (LOD = 3.0) respectively around the gene in question. Distinctness of new CMS system from the ogura CMS was also demonstrated. This newly developed CMS-fertility-restorer system has a significant potential for hybrid seed production programs in mustard as an alternative to currently popular ogura CMS system.	2016	10.1007/s10681-015-1628-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Attri, Rohit; Rahman, Habibur	Introgression of allelic diversity from genetically distinct variants of Brassica rapa into Brassica napus canola and inheritance of the B. rapa alleles	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE	Broadening of genetic diversity in spring oilseed Brassica napus L. (AACC, 2n = 38) canola is important for continued improvement of this crop. For this, the vast allelic diversity of theAgenome of Brassica rapa L. (AA, 2n = 20) can be utilised. We investigated the prospect of developing canola-quality euploid B. napus lines carrying the alleles of B. rapa from F-2 and BC1 (F-1 x B. napus) populations of three B. napus x B. rapa interspecific crosses involving one B. napus and three genetically distinct B. rapa parents. In meiosis, the F-1 AAC hybrid was expected to show normal segregation for the A genome chromosomes, whereas a range of C chromosomes from zero to nine was expected to be included in the gametes due to random segregation of this haploid set of chromosomes. Subsequent self-pollination, theoretically, should have eliminated the unpaired C chromosomes and resulted in a majority of B. rapa type. However, no B. rapa-type progeny were detected, and all progeny in the F-8 conformed to be B. napus type. Correlation between parent and offspring generation, grown in greenhouse or field, was weak to moderate for seed glucosinolate content; however, the simpler genetic control of this trait, involving only theAgenome loci, allowed the development of low-glucosinolate lines from this interspecific cross. Of the theoretical number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker alleles of B. rapa expected to be present in F-4 and F-8 populations, about 45% were detected in these populations, suggesting that the loss of these marker alleles occurred prior to the F-4 generation. Loss of several SSR loci was also detected in these populations, which probably resulted from homoeologous pairing and rearrangements of the chromosomes of the A and C genomes. Genetic diversity analysis performed on the F-8 progeny of two crosses showed that the two populations clustered into distinct groups, which demonstrates that they inherited SSR B. rapa alleles unique to each B. rapa parent. We conclude that B. rapa alleles from diverse sources can be readily incorporated into B. napus progeny by this interspecific crossing method.	2018	10.1071/CP17193		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

(2n=4x=28, (UUXXc)-U-c-X-c-X-c) chromosomes based on FISH analysis and substitution patterns in common wheat x Ae. columnaris introgressive lines	GENOME	Aegilops columnaris is a tetraploid species originated from Ae. umbellulata (2n=2x=14, UU) and a yet unknown diploid grass species. Although Ae. columnaris possesses some agronomically valuable traits, such as heat and drought tolerance and resistance to pests, it has never been used in wheat breeding because of difficulties in producing hybrids and a lack of information on the relationships between Ae. columnaris and common wheat chromosomes. In this paper, we report the development of 57 wheat Ae. columnaris introgressive lines covering 8 of the 14 chromosomes of Aegilops. Based on substitution spectra of hybrids and the results of FISH analysis of the parental Ae. columnaris line with seven DNA probes, we have developed the genetic nomenclature of the U-c and X-c chromosomes. Genetic groups and genome affinities were established for 11 of 14 chromosomes; the classification of the remaining three chromosomes remains unsolved. Each Ae. columnaris chromosome was characterized on the basis of C-banding pattern and the distribution of seven DNA sequences. Introgression processes were shown to depend on the parental wheat genotype and the level of divergence of homoeologous chromosomes. We found that lines carrying chromosome 5X(c) are resistant to leaf rust; therefore, this chromosome could possess novel resistance genes that have never been utilized in wheat breeding.	2018	10.1139/gen-2017-0186		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Badaeva, ED; Pershina, LA; Bil'danova, LL	Cytogenetic analysis of alloplasmic recombinant lines (H-vulgare) - T-aestivum unstable in fertility and viability	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Comparative cytogenetic analysis was performed with four alloplasmic recombinant (Hordeum vulgare)-Triticum aestivum lines differing in morphological traits, number of seeds per spike, and seed plumpness. None of the lines displayed introgression of the barley genetic material: the karyotypes included only common wheat chromosomes. Two lines, 79(B) and 79(D), were cytogenetically stable. Plants of lines 79(A) and 79(C) displayed a high frequency of unbalanced chromosome aberrations, including dicentric and polycentric chromosomes, terminal deletions varying in size, acentric fragments, and multiple unidentifiable translocations. Previous studies of the mitochondrial (mt) genome showed that the two cytologically unstable lines 79(C) and 79(A), which were also unstable in fertility and viability, are characterized by heteroplasmy at the mitochondrial 18S-5S locus (simultaneous presence of barley and wheat mt-fragments). Stable lines 79(B) and 79(D) with normal fertility contained only wheat mitochondrial markers. It was assumed that the substantial instability of the nuclear genome in lines 79(C) and 79(A) was a result of nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility and was associated with heteroplasmy, while elimination or considerable reduction of barley material in the mitochondrial genome stabilized the nuclear genome of lines 79(B) and 79(D). In turn, the instability of the nuclear genome was responsible for a decrease in viability and fertility of plants.	2006	10.1134/S1022795406020074		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted introgression of bacterial blight and blast resistance into DRR17B, an elite, fine-grain type maintainer line of rice	MOLECULAR BREEDING	DRR17A is a stable wild-abortive cytoplasmic male sterile line with medium-slender grain type. DRR17A and its maintainer line DRR17B are highly susceptible to two of the major rice diseases, bacterial blight (BB) and blast. To improve DRR17B for resistance against BB and blast, we have introgressed a major dominant gene each conferring resistance against BB (Xa21) and blast (Pi54) into the maintainer line through marker-assisted backcross breeding using RP-Bio-Patho-2 (a near-isogenic line of Samba Mahsuri possessing Xa21 and Pi54) as the donor parent. PCR-based molecular markers tightly linked to Xa21 and Pi54 were used for foreground selection of the resistance plants at each backcross generation, while molecular markers tightly linked to the major fertility restorer genes, Rf3 and Rf4, were used for negative selection (i.e. selection of plants possessing non-fertility-restoring alleles at the two loci) at BC1 generation. After foreground selection for the target genes at each backcross generation, the 'positive' plants were screened with parental polymorphic markers for identifying backcross plants possessing maximum recovery of DRR17B genome. Marker-assisted backcrossing was continued till BC3 generation, and a single BC3F1 plant possessing the target genes with similar to 94 % recovery of recurrent parent genome was identified and selfed to generate BC(3)F(2)s. A total of six homozygous BC3F2 plants were identified and advanced. At BC3F5, six promising, stable, backcross-derived lines possessing high level of resistance against BB and blast, high yield, short plant stature, fine-grain type, have been identified; their maintenance ability and heterotic potential validated through test crosses and these lines are being converted to CMS lines through marker-assisted breeding.	2015	10.1007/s11032-015-0348-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

QTL mapping reveals the genetic architecture of loci affecting pre- and post-zygotic isolating barriers in Louisiana Iris	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Hybridization among Louisiana Irises has been well established and the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation is known to affect the potential for and the directionality of introgression between taxa. Here we use co-dominant markers to identify regions where QTL are located both within and between backcross maps to compare the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and fitness traits across treatments and years. Results: QTL mapping was used to elucidate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation between Iris fulva and Iris brevicaulis. Homologous co-dominant EST-SSR markers scored in two backcross populations between I. fulva and I. brevicaulis were used to generate genetic linkage maps. These were used as the framework for mapping QTL associated with variation in 11 phenotypic traits likely responsible for reproductive isolation and fitness. QTL were dispersed throughout the genome, with the exception of one region of a single linkage group (LG) where QTL for flowering time, sterility, and fruit production clustered. In most cases, homologous QTL were not identified in both backcross populations, however, homologous QTL for flowering time, number of growth points per rhizome, number of nodes per inflorescence, and number of flowers per node were identified on several linkage groups. Conclusions: Two different traits affecting reproductive isolation, flowering time and sterility, exhibit different genetic architectures, with numerous QTL across the Iris genome controlling flowering time and fewer, less distributed QTL affecting sterility. QTL for traits affecting fitness are largely distributed across the genome with occasional overlap, especially on LG 4, where several QTL increasing fitness and decreasing sterility cluster. Given the distribution and effect direction of QTL affecting reproductive isolation and fitness, we have predicted genomic regions where introgression may be more likely to occur (those regions associated with an increase in fitness and unlinked to loci controlling reproductive isolation) and those that are less likely to exhibit introgression (those regions linked to traits decreasing fitness and reproductive isolation).	2012	10.1186/1471-2229-12-91		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Ballington, James R.	Taxonomic status of rabbiteye blueberry and implications for its further improvement	Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Vaccinium Culture	The specific epithet of the rabbiteye blueberry has recently been changed from Vaccinium ashei Reade to Vaccinium virgatum Aiton, based on prior publication. As presently interpreted, V. virgatum is an extremely variable hcxaploid species that occurs from South Carolina to Georgia and northern Florida and westward to east Texas and Arkansas. The hereditary background of V. virgatum is dominated by the genome of V. tenellum Ait., but also involves introgression from V. corymbosum, V. darrowi, and V. elliottii. Plant habit ranges from stoloniferous with stems 0.2m tall to crown-forming with stems 2+m tall, often within the same population. Leaves and fruit respectively range from nonglaucous and black to glaucous and blue. Taxa formerly designated as V. ashei likely are representative of more highly introgressed subpopulations within the overall range of the species. Hybrid progenies involving wild nonglaucous V. virgatum with glaucous-leaved and fruited cultivated rabbiteye are fully fertile and segregate for the glaucous-leaved and -fruited trait. Trangressive segregation for early ripening is also common in such progenies, along with improved aromatic flavor. Genotypes from the northern end of the range have the potential to improve cold hardiness in future rabbiteye cultivars. Equally as important, this represents a large germplasm reservoir for broadening the germplasm base in a crop where the present base is extremely narrow.	2006	10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.715.7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	conference abstract	FALSE			FALSE	
Baltazar, BM; Sanchez-Gonzalez, JD; de la Cruz-Larios, L; Schoper, JB	Pollination between maize and teosinte: an important determinant of gene flow in Mexico	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Gene flow between maize [Zea mays (L.)] and its wild relatives does occur, but at very low frequencies. Experiments were undertaken in Tapachula, Nayarit, Mexico to investigate gene flow between a hybrid maize, landraces of maize and teosinte (Z. mays ssp. mexicana, races Chalco and Central Plateau). Hybridization, flowering synchrony, pollen size and longevity, silk elongation rates, silk and trichome lengths and tassel diameter and morphology were measured. Hybrid and open-pollinated maize ears produced a mean of 8 and 11 seeds per ear, respectively, when hand-pollinated with teosinte pollen, which is approximately 1 - 2% of the ovules normally produced on a hybrid maize ear. Teosinte ears produced a mean of 0.2 - 0.3 seeds per ear when pollinated with maize pollen, which is more than one-fold fewer seeds than produced on a maize ear pollinated with teosinte pollen. The pollination rate on a per plant basis was similar in the context of a maize plant with 400 - 500 seeds and a teosinte plant with 30 - 40 inflorescences and 9 - 12 fruitcases per inflorescence. A number of other factors also influenced gene-flow direction: (1) between 90% and 95% of the fruitcases produced on teosinte that was fertilized by maize pollen were sterile; (2) teosinte collections were made in an area where incompatibility systems that limit fertilization are present; (3) silk longevity was much shorter for teosinte than for maize (approx. 4 days vs. approx. 11 days); (4) teosinte produced more pollen on a per plant basis than the landraces and commercial hybrid maize; (5) teosinte frequently produced lateral branches with silks close to a terminal tassel producing pollen. Collectively these factors tend to favor crossing in the direction of teosinte to maize. Our results support the hypothesis that gene flow and the subsequent introgression of maize genes into teosinte populations most probably results from crosses where teosinte first pollinates maize. The resultant hybrids then backcross with teosinte to introgress the maize genes into the teosinte genome. This approach would slow introgression and may help explain why teosinte continues to co-exist as a separate entity even though it normally grows in the vicinity of much larger populations of maize.	2005	10.1007/s00122-004-1859-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Barba-Gonzalez, R.; Miller, C. T.; Ramanna, M. S.; van Tuyl, J. M.	Induction of 2n gametes for overcoming F1-sterility in lily and tulip	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM SECTION ORNAMENTALS: BREEDING FOR BEAUTY	For overcoming F1-sterility in interspecific hybrids, mitotic and meiotic polyploidisation is applied in lily and can result in fertile allopolyploids. The mechanism of viable pollen production of mitotic and meiotic polyploidisation is quite different. Mitotic polyploids are obtained by artificial chromosome doubling and results in normal pairing of homologous chromosome set, which enables the formation of 2x gametes during the meiosis. Meiotic polyploidisation, on the other hand, leads in rare cases of restitutional chromosome division, to the formation of unreduced gametes (2n gametes). In contrast to mitotic doubling, homoeologous recombination can occur in these gametes. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to discriminate parental chromosomes in the F1 hybrids and backcross progenies to detect homoeologous recombination. Mitotic polyploidisation showed no homoeologous recombinations between the parental genomes whereas in meiotic polyploids it was detected in a high frequency. The use of 2n gametes is therefore the most promising approach for the introgression of desirable characters in using interspecific hybrids in breeding. In both cases, the frequency of viable gametes appeared to be low and limited to a few F1-hybrids. A new and promising method is developed in which 2ngametes can be induced by the application of laughing gas (N2O). This method proved to be successful in lily and the occurrence of homoeologous recombination, a characteristic of meiotic polyploidisation, was detected. In tulip where the production of mitotic polyploids requires at least five years, it will speed up breeding with interspecific hybrids enormously.	2006	10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.714.11		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted improvement of bacterial blight resistance in parental lines of Pusa RH10, a superfine grain aromatic rice hybrid	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Pusa RH10, the widely cultivated superfine grain aromatic rice hybrid, and its parental lines Pusa6B and PRR78 are susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Pusa1460, a Basmati rice variety, was utilized as the donor for introgressing BB resistance genes xa13 and Xa21 into Pusa6B and PRR78 using a marker-assisted backcross breeding program. The markers RG136 and pTA248 linked to BB resistance genes xa13 and Xa21, respectively, were used for foreground selection. Seventy-four STMS markers polymorphic between Pusa6B and Pusa1460, and 54 STMS markers polymorphic between PRR78 and Pusa1460, were utilized for background selection to recover the recurrent parent genome ranging from 85.14 to 97.30% and 87.04 to 92.81% in the 10 best BC(2)F(5) families of Pusa6B and PRR78, respectively. RM6100, an STMS marker linked to fertility restorer gene (Rf), was used for marker-assisted selection of Rf gene in an improved version of PRR78. The extent of donor segments in the improved version of Pusa6B was estimated to be < 0.97 and < 2.15 Mb in the genomic regions flanking xa13 and Xa21, respectively, whereas in improved PRR78, it was estimated to be < 2.07 and < 3.45 Mb in the corresponding genomic regions. Improved lines of Pusa6B and PRR78 showed yield advantages of up to 8.24 and 5.23%, respectively. The performance of the BB-resistant version of Pusa RH10 produced by intercrossing the improved parental lines was on a par with or superior to the original Pusa RH10.	2010	10.1007/s11032-010-9407-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Its thirteen closely related species, along with four closely allied Solanum species, provide a defined group with diverse mating systems that display complex interspecific reproductive barriers. Several kinds of pre- and postzygotic barriers have already been identified within this clade. Well-developed genetic maps, introgression lines, interspecific bridging lines, and the newly available draft genome sequence of the domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are valuable tools for the genetic analysis of interspecific reproductive barriers. The excellent chromosome morphology of these diploid species allows detailed cytological analysis of interspecific hybrids. Transgenic methodologies, well developed in the Solanaceae, allow the functional testing of candidate reproductive barrier genes as well as live imaging of pollen rejection events through the use of fluorescently tagged proteins. Proteomic and transcriptomics approaches are also providing new insights into the molecular nature of interspecific barriers. Recent progress toward understanding reproductive isolation mechanisms using these molecular and genetic tools is assessed in this review.	2011	10.1007/s00497-010-0155-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	review	FALSE			FALSE	
Begheyn, Rachel F.; Yates, Steven A.; Sykes, Timothy; Studer, Bruno	Genetic Loci Governing Androgenic Capacity in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Immature pollen can be induced to switch developmental pathways from gametogenesis to embryogenesis and subsequently regenerate into homozygous, diploid plants. Such androgenic production of doubled haploids is particularly useful for species where inbreeding is hampered by effective self-incompatibility systems. Therefore, increasing the generally low androgenic capacity of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) germplasm would enable the efficient production of homozygous plant material, so that a more effective exploitation of heterosis through hybrid breeding schemes can be realized. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study in a heterozygous, multiparental population of perennial ryegrass (n = 391) segregating for androgenic capacity. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to interrogate gene- dense genomic regions and revealed over 1,100 polymorphic sites. Between one and 10 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for anther response, embryo and total plant production, green and albino plant production and regeneration. Most traits were under polygenic control, although a major QTL on linkage group 5 was associated with green plant regeneration. Distinct genetic factors seem to affect green and albino plant recovery. Two intriguing candidate genes, encoding chromatin binding domains of the developmental phase transition regulator, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, were identified. Our results shed the first light on the molecular mechanisms behind perennial ryegrass microspore embryogenesis and enable marker-assisted introgression of androgenic capacity into recalcitrant germplasm of this forage crop of global significance.	2018	10.1534/g3.117.300550		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgrssion lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Behera, Tusar K.; Staub, Jack E.; Behera, Snigdha; Delannay, Isabelle Y.; Chen, Jin Feng	Marker-assisted backcross selection in an interspecific Cucumis population broadens the genetic base of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)	EUPHYTICA	Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a major cucurbit vegetable species whose genetic base has been drastically reduced during its domestication. The crop's narrow genetic base (3-12% DNA polymorphism) has resulted from the use of limited genetic material and intense selection during plant improvement. Recently, however, interspecific hybridization has been successful in Cucumis via mating of C. hystrix Chakr. and C. sativus, which resulted in the amphidiploid C. hytivus. We report herein a marker-assisted strategy for increasing genetic diversity in cucumber through introgression backcrossing employing C. hytivus. The comparatively late-flowering but high-yielding, indeterminate, monoecious line WI 7012A (P(1); donor parent) derived from a C. hytivus x C. sativus-derived line (long-fruited Chinese C. sativus cv. Beijingjietou) was initially crossed to the determinate, gynoecious C. sativus line WI 7023A (P(2); recurrent parent 1), and then advanced backcross generation progeny (BC(2)) were crossed with the gynoecious indeterminate line WI 9-6A (P(3); recurrent parent 2). More specifically, a single F(1) individual (P(1) x P(2)) was backcrossed to P(2), and then BC progeny were crossed to P(2) and P(3), where marker-assisted selection (MAS) for genetic diversity (8 mapped and 16 unmapped markers; designated Sel) or no selection (designated NSel) was applied to produce BC(3)P(2) (Sel) and BC(3)P(3) (Sel), and BC(2)P(2) (NSel) and BC(2)P(2)S(1) (NSel) progeny. Relative vegetative growth, number of lateral branches (LB), days to flowering (DF), yield (fruit number), and fruit quality [as measured by length:diameter (L:D) and endocarp:total diameter (E:T) ratios] were assessed in parents and cross-progeny. DF varied from similar to 20 (BC(3)P(2)Sel) to similar to 25 days (BC(2)P(3)Sel) among the populations examined, where progeny derived from P(2) possessed the shortest DF. Differences in cumulative yield among the populations over six harvests were detected, varying from similar to 8 fruits per plant in BC(3)P(2) (Sel) to similar to 39 fruits per plant in BC(2)P(3) (Sel). Although the vigorous vegetative growth of line P(1) was observed in its backcross progeny, highly heterozygous and polymorphic backcross progeny derived from P(3) were comparatively more vigorous and bore many high-quality fruit. Response to selection was detected for LB, DF, L:D, and E:T, but the effectiveness of MAS depended upon the parental lines used. Data indicate that the genetic diversity of commercial cucumber can be increased by introgression of the C. hystrix genome through backcrossing.	2011	10.1007/s10681-010-0315-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Introgression of the low-gossypol seed & high-gossypol plant trait in upland cotton: Analysis of [(Gossypium hirsutum x G. raimondii)A(2)A xA G. sturtianum] trispecific hybrid and selected derivatives using mapped SSRs	MOLECULAR BREEDING	In order to select genotypes of Gossypium hirsutum genetically balanced and expressing the low-gossypol seed & high-gossypol plant trait introgressed from the Australian wild diploid species G. sturtianum, the [(G. hirsutum x G. raimondii)A(2)A xA G. sturtianum] triple hybrid was backcrossed to G. hirsutum and autopollinated to produce backcross and selfed progenies. Two hundred and six mapped SSR markers of G. hirsutum were used to monitor the introgression of SSR alleles specific to G. sturtianum and G. raimondii in the selected progenies. A high level of heterozygosity, varying from 25 to 100%, was observed for all G. sturtianum-specific SSR markers conserved in the most advanced progenies. These results indicate the existence of segregation distortion factors that are associated with the genes controlling the researched trait. This study represents a starting point to map the genes involved in the expression of the trait and better understand its genetic determinism.	2010	10.1007/s11032-009-9331-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Benbouza, Halima; Lognay, George; Scheffler, Jodi; Baudoin, Jean Pierre; Mergeai, Guy	Expression of the "glanded-plant and glandless-seed" trait of Australian diploid cottons in different genetic backgrounds	EUPHYTICA	The expression of the "glanded-plant and glandless-seed" trait was assessed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis methods in different Gossypium hybrids obtained by crossing Australian diploid cottons and various diploid and tetraploid species. Significant variation in the gossypol content in the seed was observed among the analyzed genotypes. HPLC data demonstrated that the gossypol synthesis repression mechanism in the Australian diploid species belonging to C and G genomes was dominant but did not confirm its preferential functioning against A genome species bearing GL(2) locus. About 10% of the produced seeds had total gossypol content lower than the limit imposed by the World Health Organisation (600 ppm) for the use of cotton flour in food and feed. HPLC analysis of the terpenoids aldehyde (TA) contents in the aerial parts of the hybrids showed important qualitative and quantitative variability. This result could indicate a certain separation between pigment gland morphogenesis and terpenoid synthesis mechanisms in cotton.	2009	10.1007/s10681-008-9772-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Bennett, Rick A.; Seguin-Swartz, Ginette; Rahman, Habibur	Broadening Genetic Diversity in Canola Using the C-Genome Species Brassica oleracea L.	CROP SCIENCE	Genetic diversity in spring type canola (Brassica napus L., AACC genome, 2n = 38) cultivars is narrow. Limited effort has been made to utilize genetic diversity from the diploid species Brassica oleracea L. (CC genome, 2n = 18) due to lack of canola quality traits in seeds of this species. The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of introgressing canola quality traits from B. napus into B. oleracea for the purpose of developing canola quality B. oleracea as well as development of B. napus with greater genetic diversity from B. oleracea while retaining canola quality traits. Two inbred (B. napus x B. oleracea) x B. oleracea populations were generated using B. napus 'Hi-Q' and A01-104NA and B. oleracea var. alboglabra (L. H. Bailey) Musil (Chinese kale). These populations were assessed for seed quality, effectiveness of selection based on morphological traits, genetic diversity using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and ploidy levels using flow cytometry and cytological analysis of meiotic chromosomes. Zero-erucic and low glucosinolate types were recovered from a relatively small segregating population. Morphological grouping could not reliably be used to select B. oleracea plants with 2n = 18; all BC 1 S 6 families had nuclear DNA content similar to the B. napus parents. Marker analysis revealed a high level of B. oleracea alleles among backcross lines. These findings suggest that introgression of genetic diversity from the diploid B. oleracea C-genome into stable, canola quality B. napus type lines is feasible and may have great potential in developing genetically diverse spring type varieties.	2012	10.2135/cropsci2011.11.0580		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Bertin, Isabelle; Fish, Lesley; Foote, Tracie N.; Knight, Emilie; Snape, John; Moore, Graham	Development of consistently crossable wheat genotypes for alien wheat gene transfer through fine-mapping of the Kr1 locus	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Breeders can force sexual hybridisation between wheat and related grass species to produce interspecific hybrids containing a dihaploid set of wheat and related chromosomes. This facilitates the introgression of desirable genes into wheat from the secondary gene pool. However, most elite European wheat varieties carry genes that suppress crossability, making the transfer of novel traits from exotic germplasm into elite wheat varieties difficult or impossible. Previous studies have identified at least five crossability loci in wheat. Here, the crossability locus with the largest effect, Kr1 on chromosome arm 5BL, was fine-mapped by developing a series of recombinant substitution lines in which the genome of the normally non-crossable wheat variety 'Hobbit sib' carries a recombinant 5BL chromosome arm containing segments from the crossable variety 'Chinese Spring'. These recombinant lines were scored for their ability to cross with rye over four seasons. Analysis revealed at least two regions on 5BL affecting crossability, including the Kr1 locus. However, the ability to set seed is highly dependent on prevailing environmental conditions. Typically, even crossable wheat lines exhibit little or no seed set when crossed with rye in winter, but show up to 90% seed set from similar crosses made in summer. By recombining different combinations of the two regions affecting crossability, wheat lines that consistently exhibit up to 50% seed set, whether crossed in the UK winter or summer conditions, were generated, thus creating a very important tool for increasing the efficiency of alien wheat transfer programmes.	2009	10.1007/s00122-009-1141-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Bertrand, B; Etienne, H; Lashermes, P; Guyot, B; Davrieux, F	Can near-infrared reflectance of green coffee be used to detect introgression in Coffea arabica cultivars?	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE	Most new coffee cultivars disseminated over the last 1 S years are derived from the Timor Hybrid (Coffea arabica x C canephora). Introgression of genes from the C canephora genome has been estimated at between 9 and 29% of the genome. It has been shown that introgression can have a negative impact on the cup quality of cultivars derived from the Timor Hybrid. Consequently, coffee buyers or roasters may wish to assess whether the coffee they are purchasing comes from introgressed varieties. The possibility of distinguishing between non-introgressed Arabicas and genotypes carrying chromosome fragments introgressed from C canephora was investigated (i) using some classical chemical compounds (caffeine, chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, fat and sucrose) and (ii) using a new approach based on spectra acquired by near-infrared reflectance of green coffee. Near-infrared spectra were obtained for 129 samples from two collections (Nicaragua and Costa Rica) of introgressed and non-introgressed coffee trees. The spectral collections were treated by principal component and factorial discrimination. When the introgressed coffee trees were compared with the non-introgressed trees using the chemical compounds, small but significant differences were found in caffeine, trigonelline and chlorogenic acid contents. However, the small variations in those compounds are not enough to detect introgression. The spectral collections treated by principal component and factorial discrimination made it possible to class from 92.30 to 94.87% of the analysed samples correctly, while the percentages of correctly classified samples in the verification file varied from 88.23 to 94.11%. The NIRS method appears to be an efficient method for determining whether a green coffee comes from an introgressed variety.

Bhat, SR; Vijayan, P; Ashutosh; Dwivedi, KK; Prakash, S	Diplotaxis erucoides-induced cytoplasmic male sterility in Brassica juncea is rescued by the Moricandia arvensis restorer: genetic and molecular analyses	PLANT BREEDING	An alloplasmic cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line of Brassica juncea was developed by repeated backcrossing of the sexual hybrid (Diplotaxis erucoides x Brassica rapa) with B. juncea cv. 'Pusa Bold'. The CMS line is comparable to the B. juncea nuclear donor line for all morphological traits except male fertility. Southern and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) analyses showed that the CMS line carries organellar genomes from the wild species that differ from the organellar genomes of B. juncea. Northern analysis with three mitochondrial gene probes revealed altered atp alpha transcription pattern associated with male sterility. The restorer of CMS (Moricandia arvensis) B. juncea was found to restore male fertility to the new CMS system. The mode of fertility restoration was found to be monogenic and gametophytic. The study identified CAPS markers for the psbB gene that could be useful in quick identification of the erucoides CMS line. Broad similarities and important differences observed at the molecular level between M. arvensis and D. erucoides CMS systems of B. juncea are discussed.	2005	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01184.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Bialozyt, R.; Rathmacher, G.; Niggemann, M.; Ziegenhagen, B.	Reconstructing explicit mating schemes in poplar hybrids - a case study in the Populus nigra L. - Populus x canadensis Moench complex	SILVAE GENETICA	In the plant kingdom, a large percentage of taxa are known to interbreed. If these hybrids are fertile, introgressive gene flow may foster the development of hybrid swarms or even promote gene swamping. Our study focuses on the Eurasian black poplar (Populus nigra L.) which may be threatened by hybridization with the cultivated fertile Euramerican hybrid. Using a combination of taxa specific DNA markers from the chloroplast and the nuclear genome we set up a straightforward and cost efficient method for identification of all possible mating scenarios in the hybrid complex of P. nigra and its cultivar Populus x canadensis Moench. Within a mixed population, we analyzed seed collections from individual trees of both taxa as well as juveniles from natural regeneration for proportions of second-generation hybrids (F2 hybrids) and first generation backcrosses. While F2 hybrids were detected in the seeds only, first generation backcrosses occurred in seeds as well as in juveniles. Due to the meiotic segregation of alleles, a certain amount of such progeny may remain undetected. Based on Mendelian rules, we developed a scheme to adjust the observed proportion of hybrid progeny for these undetected cases. Moreover, the scheme can be used to iteratively add loci necessary to detect poplar hybrids beyond the second hybrid and first generation backcrosses. We questioned whether there is a risk of hybrid swarm formation or swamping of the P. nigra gene pool. We discuss the likelihood of such a scenario and draw conclusions for conservation issues while poplar plantations are increasingly appreciated as renewable resources.	2012	10.1515/sg-2012-0020		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Bouck, A; Peeler, R; Arnold, ML; Wessler, SR	Genetic mapping of species boundaries in Louisiana irises using IRRE retrotransposon display markers	GENETICS	Genetic mapping studies provide insight into the pattern and extent of genetic incompatibilities affecting hybridization between closely related species. Genetic maps of two species of Louisiana Irises, Iris fulva and L brevicaulis, were constructed from transposon-based molecular markers segregating in reciprocal backcross (BC1) interspecific hybrids and used to investigate genomic patterns of species barriers inhibiting introgression. Linkage mapping analyses indicated very little genetic incompatibility between L fulva and L brevicaulis in the form of map regions exhibiting transmission ratio distortion, and this was confirmed using a Bayesian multipoint mapping analysis. These results demonstrate the utility of transposon-based marker systems for genetic mapping studies of wild plant species and indicate that the genomes of I. falva and I. brevicaulis are highly permeable to gene flow and introgression from one another via backcrossing.	2005	10.1534/genetics.105.044552		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Boyaci, H. F.	DEVELOPMENT OF NEW VALUABLE INTROGRESSION LINES FROM THE INTERSPECIFIC CROSS IN EGGPLANT (SOLANUM MELONGENA L.)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH	Genetic diversity in eggplant cultivars has drastically decreased due to developed varieties having similar desirable characteristics. In recent years, the breeders have taken much effort to enrich eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) genome by utilizing local populations and wild relatives similarly to the case of other plant species. In addition, wild relatives make it possible to benefit from their resistance genes which provide tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress factors. In this study, preservation and maintenance of genetic diversity by utilizing wild eggplant species to alleviate the restrictions in eggplant breeding programs caused by the limited genetic background through creating interspecific crosses was established as the main goal. In total, nine species chosen among the wild relatives of eggplant were crossed with two inbred lines developed from Solanum melongena L. Hybrid seed was available only in five crosses. Just, 38 lines developed in F4 stage from Solanum insanum. These lines were examined morphologically by using 27 descriptors. The data was analyzed by NTSYSpc: Numerical Taxonomy and Multivariate Analysis System (Version 2.0) program for understanding their phylogenetic relationship. A high variance changing in between 27% and 97% was observed among them. This result showed that they have good potentials to be used in breeding programs.	2020	10.15666/aeer/1801_17711781		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Brennan, A. C.; Hiscock, S. J.; Abbott, R. J.	Interspecific crossing and genetic mapping reveal intrinsic genomic incompatibility between two Senecio species that form a hybrid zone on Mount Etna, Sicily	HEREDITY	Studies of hybridizing species can reveal much about the genetic basis and maintenance of species divergence in the face of gene flow. Here we report a genetic segregation and linkage analysis conducted on F-2 progeny of a reciprocal cross between Senecio aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius that form a hybrid zone on Mount Etna, Sicily, aimed at determining the genetic basis of intrinsic hybrid barriers between them. Significant transmission ratio distortion (TRD) was detected at 34 (similar to 27%) of 127 marker loci located in nine distinct clusters across seven of the ten linkage groups detected, indicating genomic incompatibility between the species. TRD at these loci could not be attributed entirely to post-zygotic selective loss of F-2 individuals that failed to germinate or flower (16.7%). At four loci tests indicated that pre-zygotic events, such as meiotic drive in F-1 parents or gametophytic selection, contributed to TRD. Additional tests revealed that cytonuclear incompatibility contributed to TRD at five loci, Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities involving epistatic interactions between loci contributed to TRD at four loci, and underdominance (heterozygote disadvantage) was a possible cause of TRD at one locus. Major chromosomal rearrangements were probably not a cause of interspecific incompatibility at the scale that could be examined with current map marker density. Intrinsic genomic incompatibility between S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius revealed by TRD across multiple genomic regions in early-generation hybrids is likely to impact the genetic structure of the natural hybrid zone on Mount Etna by limiting introgression and promoting divergence across the genome.	2014	10.1038/hdy.2014.14		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Brennan, Adrian C.; Harris, Stephen A.; Hiscock, Simon J.	THE POPULATION GENETICS OF SPOROPHYTIC SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY IN THREE HYBRIDIZING SENECIO (ASTERACEAE) SPECIES WITH CONTRASTING POPULATION HISTORIES	EVOLUTION	Hybridization generates evolutionary novelty and spreads adaptive variation. By promoting outcrossing, plant self-incompatibility (SI) systems also favor interspecific hybridization because the S locus is under strong negative frequency-dependent balancing selection. This study investigates the SI mating systems of three hybridizing Senecio species with contrasting population histories. Senecio aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius native to Sicily, form a hybrid zone at intermediate altitudes on Mount Etna, and their neo-homoploid hybrid species, S. squalidus, has colonized disturbed urban habitats in the UK during the last 150 years. We show that all three species express sporophytic SI (SSI), where pollen incompatibility is controlled by the diploid parental genome, and that SSI is inherited and functions normally in hybrids. Large-scale crossing studies of wild sampled populations allowed direct comparison of SSI between species and found that the main impacts of colonization in S. squalidus compared to Sicilian Senecio was a reduced number of S alleles, increased S allele frequencies, and increased interpopulation S allele sharing. In general, many S alleles were shared between species and the S locus showed reduced intra- and interspecific population genetic structure compared to molecular genetic markers, indicative of enhanced effective gene flow due to balancing selection.	2013	10.1111/evo.12033		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Bures, Petr; Smarda, Petr; Rotreklova, Olga; Oberreiter, Michal; Buresova, Michaela; Konecny, Jiri; Knoll, Ales; Fajmon, Karel; Smerda, Jakub	Pollen viability and natural hybridization of Central European species of Cirsium	PRESLIA	Pollen viability was analysed causally between and within Central European Cirsium species and their hybrids to determine (i) how frequently hybrids are fertile and produce viable pollen; (ii) how the pollen viability of hybrids and their parents are related and how this is affected by the genetic distance between parents; (iii) how species promiscuity relates to species pollen viability; (iv) to what extent the pollen viability of a hybrid may predetermine its frequency in nature; (v) how the pollen viability of a hybrid and sympatricity of its parental species are related; and (vii) how the frequency of females in populations of gynodioecious species may affect the observed pollen viability. Altogether, the viability of 656,363 pollen grains was analysed using Alexander's staining (1185 flowers from 301 plants from 67 field populations of 13 pure species and 1693 flowers from 345 plants from 96 field populations of 16 natural hybrids). The particular characters potentially related with pollen viability were estimated using following methods: natural hybrid frequency and species interfertility (by herbarium data), genetic distance (by AFLP), sympatricity (in local scale based on herbaria and literature data; on a global scale using the similarity between digitized maps of natural ranges). The strengths of pre- or postzygotic isolation were estimated for hybridizing species pairs using geographical data and pollen viability analyses. All hermaphrodite plants of the Cirsium hybrids had viable pollen, generally at lower levels than those found in pure species. The pollen viability of a hybrid generally decreased with increasing genetic distance between the parents and when the parental species had lower pollen viability. The pollen viability was decreased in frequently hybridizing species where occasionally individuals of pure species morphology may show decreased pollen viability. In some instances these might represent some unrecognized hybrid back-crosses. In populations of gynodioecious species where females co-occurred, pollen viability (in hermaphrodites) was also lower, indicating some degree of inbreeding depression. Hybrids between sympatric species exhibited higher post-pollination isolation (decrease of pollen viability), which suggests that the reproductive.isolation had been increased by natural selection (effect similar to the Wallace effect). The strength of the postzygotic barrier (based on pollen viability) was generally stronger than that of the prezygotic barrier (based on distribution overlap) in studied hybridizing species pairs.	2010			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not explicitly measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Burkart-Waco, Diana; Josefsson, Caroline; Dilkes, Brian; Kozloff, Nora; Torjek, Otto; Meyer, Rhonda; Altmann, Thomas; Comai, Luca	Hybrid Incompatibility in Arabidopsis Is Determined by a Multiple-Locus Genetic Network	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY	The cross between Arabidopsis thaliana and the closely related species Arabidopsis arenosa results in postzygotic hybrid incompatibility, manifested as seed death. Ecotypes of A. thaliana were tested for their ability to produce live seed when crossed to A. arenosa. The identified genetic variation was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) encoded by the A. thaliana genome that affect the frequency of postzygotic lethality and the phenotypes of surviving seeds. Seven QTLs affecting the A. thaliana component of this hybrid incompatibility were identified by crossing a Columbia x C24 recombinant inbred line population to diploid A. arenosa pollen donors. Additional epistatic loci were identified based on their pairwise interaction with one or several of these QTLs. Epistatic interactions were detected for all seven QTLs. The two largest additive QTLs were subjected to fine-mapping, indicating the action of at least two genes in each. The topology of this network reveals a large set of minor-effect loci from the maternal genome controlling hybrid growth and viability at different developmental stages. Our study establishes a framework that will enable the identification and characterization of genes and pathways in A. thaliana responsible for hybrid lethality in the A. thaliana x A. arenosa interspecific cross.	2012	10.1104/pp.111.188706		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Cryptic Introgression of Dasypyrum villosum Parental DNA in Wheat Lines Derived from Intergeneric Hybridization	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Cytogenetic and DNA molecular analyses have been carried out in 3 wheat introgression lines (ILs; CS x V58, CS x V59, and CS x V60) derived from Triticum aestivum cv. 'Chinese Spring' (CS) x Dasypyrum villosum (Dv) intergeneric hybridization. All lines, which showed several phenotypic differences compared to CS, had the same chromosome number (2n = 42) and structure as CS, and neither chromosomes nor chromatin from Dv were apparently added to their complement. However, Feulgen/DNA cytophotometry showed that there was more nuclear DNA in the lines than in the parental wheat (by 1.85%, 2.76%, and 1.26% in CS x V58, CS x V59, and CS x V60, respectively). Molecular investigation indicated the presence of Dv DNA in the ILs. AFLP analysis of genomic DNA from the ILs, CS, and Dv detected a total of 120 polymorphic bands, of which 7 (5.8%) were present in some or all the ILs and Dv but were absent in CS. PCR amplification, sequence analysis of amplicons, and Southern blot hybridization confirmed the presence of Dv-specific sequences in each of the ILs. These results indicate cryptic introgression of Dv DNA sequences into the genome of the ILs. Some implications of this finding are discussed. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

Cai, Yunfei; Quan, Taiyong; Yu, Yang; Liu, Guanghua; Xiang, Fengning	Genotyping and metabolite characterization of somatic hybrids between Arabidopsis thaliana and Swertia mussotii	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT	Symmetric and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced asymmetric fusions between Swertia mussotii and Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts generated > 100 putative hybrid cell lines. Of these, 65 were shown to have a hybrid origin, based on molecular markers, chromosome number, and morphology. An assay directed at the A. thaliana CACTA transposon family detected only three positive lines among the 65 hybrid calli tested. The CACTA sequence amplified from clone D14 was highly homologous with CAC2, indicating that the chromosome content of the hybrid cell lines was largely inherited from S. mussotii. Profiles of secondary metabolites identified a number of S. mussotii- or A. thaliana-specific compounds, as well as significant proportions of compounds not represented in the profile of either parent.	2015	10.1007/s11627-015-9680-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Calafiore, R.; Rigano, M. M.; Raiola, A.; Aliberti, A.; Barone, A.	Marker-assisted pyramiding of quantitative trait loci controlling fruit quality traits in tomato	IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOLECULAR MARKERS IN HORTICULTURE	Tomato consumption is considered fundamental for human health for its high nutritional value, mainly ascribed to antioxidant metabolites. In the last few years, we have focused our research on deciphering the genetic control of antioxidant compounds in tomato fruits and to produce superior genetic materials with an increased amount of bioactive compounds in the red ripe berry. For this purpose, we used introgression lines (ILs) obtained from the wild species Solanum pennellii, and we selected lines IL7-3 and IL12-4 for their high content of hydrophilic antioxidants in the fruit. These lines were crossed to combine the identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and obtain superior hybrids. A set of species-specific molecular markers was used to clearly distinguish the wild S. pennellii from the cultivated Solanum lycopersicum genome. In the present work, we describe the selection of one double homozygous hybrid (DHO22) and its multilevel characterization in comparison with its parental genotypes and with the cultivated genotype M82. The selected hybrid DHO22 exhibits high contents of ascorbic acid and phenolics, combined with good performances in terms of yield and other fruit quality traits, and clearly resembles the cultivated genotype M82. In future, this line could be used as pre-breeding material to obtain a new cultivar improved for nutritional traits.	2018	10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1203.11		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Campbell, Lesley G.; Teitel, Zachary; Miriti, Maria N.	Contemporary evolution and the dynamics of invasion in crop-wild hybrids with heritable variation for two weedy life-histories	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Gene flow in crop-wild complexes between phenotypically differentiated ancestors may transfer adaptive genetic variation that alters the fecundity and, potentially, the population growth (lambda) of weeds. We created biotypes with potentially invasive traits, early flowering or long leaves, in wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) and F-5 crop-wild hybrid (R. sativus x R. raphanistrum) backgrounds and compared them to randomly mated populations, to provide the first experimental estimate of long-term fitness consequences of weedy life-history variation. Using a life table response experiment design, we modeled lambda of experimental, field populations in Pellston, MI, and assessed the relative success of alternative weed strategies and the contributions of individual vital rates (germination, survival, seed production) to differences in lambda among experimental populations. Growth rates (lambda) were most influenced by seed production, a trait altered by hybridization and selection, compared to other vital rates. More seeds were produced by wild than hybrid populations and by long-leafed than early-flowering lineages. Although we did not detect a biotype by selection treatment effect on lambda, lineages also exhibited contrasting germination and survival strategies. Identifying life-history traits affecting population growth contributes to our understanding of which portions of the crop genome are most likely to introgress into weed populations.	2016	10.1111/eva.12366		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Canady, MA; Meglic, V; Chetelat, RT	A library of Solanum lycopersicoides introgression lines in cultivated tomato	GENOME	A set of introgression lines (ILs), containing individual chromosome segments from the wild nightshade Solanum lycopersicoides bred into the genetic background of cultivated tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), has been developed. A primary group of 56 lines was selected for maximum representation of the S. lycopersicoides genome (similar to 96% of the total map units), homozygosity, and a minimum number of introgressed segments per line. A secondary set of 34 lines provides increased map resolution in certain regions. Approximately 34% of the lines were sterile in the homozygous condition, but could be maintained by heterozygotes. To facilitate identification of segregating ILs, restriction fragment length polymorphism probes were converted to higher throughput cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers, which supplement allozyme and morphological loci. Strong segregation distortion was observed in F-2 progeny of heterozygous ILs, with an excess of L. esculentum alleles in most regions. For introgressions on distal chromosome 1L, a preferential transmission of S. lycopersicoides alleles was observed in the male germ line. Homozygous ILs generally yielded less seed from self pollination than corresponding heterozygotes, indicating that sterility effects were recessive. This IL library provides a novel resource for genetic studies of traits found in S. lycopersicoides.	2005	10.1139/G05-032		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Canady, Michael A.; Ji, Yuanfu; Chetelat, Roger T.	Homeologous recombination in Solanum lycopersicoides introgression lines of cultivated tomato	GENETICS	A library of "introgression lines" containing Solanum lycopersicoides chromosome segments in the genetic background of cultivated tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) was used to study factors affecting homeologous recombination. Recombination rates were estimated in progeny of 43 heterozygous introgressions and whole-chromosome substitution lines, together representing 11 of the 12 tomato chromosomes. Recombination within homeologous segments was reduced to as little as 0-10% of expected frequencies. Relative recombination rates were positively correlated with the length of introgressed segments on the tomato map. The highest recombination (up to 40-50% of normal) was observed in long introgressions or substitution lines. Double-introgression lines containing two homeologous segments on opposite chromosome arms were synthesized to increase their combined length. Recombination was higher in the double than in the single segment lines, despite a preference for crossovers in the region of homology between segments. A greater increase in homeologous recombination was obtained by crossing the S. lycopersicoides introgression lines to L. pennellii-a phylogenetically intermediate species-or to L. esculentum lines containing single L. pennellii segments on the same chromosome. Recombination rates were highest in regions of overlap between S. lycopersicoides and L. pennellii segments. The potential application of these results to breeding with introgression lines is discussed.	2006	10.1534/genetics.106.065144		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Cao, Aqin; Jin, Jie; Li, Shaoqing; Wang, Jianbo	Integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling in rice backcrossed progenies (BC2F12) with different plant height	PLOS ONE	Inter-specific hybridization and backcrossing commonly occur in plants. The use of progeny generated from inter-specific hybridization and backcrossing has been developed as a novel model system to explore gene expression divergence. The present study investigated the analysis of gene expression and miRNA regulation in backcrossed introgression lines constructed from cultivated and wild rice. High-throughput sequencing was used to compare gene and miRNA expression profiles in three progeny lines (L1710, L1817 and L1730), with different plant heights resulting from the backcrossing of introgression lines (BC2F12) and their parents (O. sativa and O. longistaminata). A total of 25,387 to 26,139 mRNAs and 379 to 419 miRNAs were obtained in these rice lines. More differentially expressed genes and miRNAs were detected in progeny/O. longistaminata comparison groups than in progeny/O. sativa comparison groups. Approximately 80% of the genes and miRNAs showed expression level dominance to O. sativa, indicating that three progeny lines were closer to the recurrent parent, which might be influenced by their parental genome dosage. Approximately 16% to 64% of the differentially expressed miRNAs possessing coherent target genes were predicted, and many of these miRNAs regulated multiple target genes. Most genes were up-regulated in progeny lines compared with their parents, but down-regulated in the higher plant height line in the comparison groups among the three progeny lines. Moreover, certain genes related to cell walls and plant hormones might play crucial roles in the plant height variations of the three progeny lines. Taken together, these results provided valuable information on the molecular mechanisms of hybrid backcrossing and plant height variations based on the gene and miRNA expression levels in the three progeny lines.	2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0184106		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Whole Plastome Sequencing Within Silene Section Psammophilae Reveals Mainland Hybridization and Divergence With the Balearic Island Populations	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships within Caryophyllaceae tribe Sileneae has been obscured by hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. Silene is the largest genus in the Caryophyllaceae, and unraveling its evolutionary history has been particularly challenging. In order to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the five species in Silene section Psammophilae, we have performed a genome skimming approach to acquire the complete plastid genome (cpDNA), nuclear ribosomal cistron (nrDNA), and partial mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). We have included 26 populations, representing the range of each species' distribution. This section includes five morphologically similar species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands (Ibiza and Formentera), yet some of them occupy distinct edaphic habitats (e.g. maritime sands, calcareous sandstones). In addition to phylogeographic analyses, genetic structuring using the chloroplast data set was inferred with Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), and a partial Mantel test. Reference-guided assembly of 50 bp single-end and 250 bp paired-end Illumina reads produced the nearly complete cpDNA genome (154 kbp), partial mtDNA genome (from 81 to 114 kbp), and the nrDNA cistron (6.4 kbp). Selected variable regions of the cpDNA and mtDNA assemblies were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses of the mainland populations reveal incongruence among the three genomes. None of the three data sets produced relationships consistent with taxonomy or geography. In contrast, Silene cambessedesii, present in the Balearic Islands, is the only species that forms a strongly supported monophyletic clade in the cpDNA genome and is strongly differentiated with respect to the remaining taxa of the Iberian Peninsula. These results contrast with those obtained for mainland populations. Across the entire analysis, only one well-supported mainland clade of Silene littorea and Silene stockenii emerges from the southern region of the Iberian Peninsula. DAPC and AMOVA results suggest the absence of genetic structure among mainland populations of Silene section Psammophilae, whereas partial Mantel test discarded spatial correlation of genetic differentiation. The widespread incongruence between morphology-based taxonomic boundaries and phylogeography suggests a history of interspecific hybridization, in which only a substantial geographic barrier, like isolation by the Mediterranean Sea, was sufficient to create and maintain species boundaries in Silene section Psammophilae.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.01466		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	*quantify introgression with structure-like analyses	FALSE			FALSE	
Carputo, Domenico; Castaldi, Luigi; Caruso, Immacolata; Aversano, Riccardo; Monti, Luigi; Frusciante, Luigi	Resistance to frost and tuber soft rot in near-pentaploid Solanum tuberosum- S-commersonii hybrids	BREEDING SCIENCE	The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the tolerance to low temperatures and tuber soft rot in sexual near-pentaploid hybrids between incongruent 2x (1EBN) Solanum commersonii (CMM) and 4x (4EBN) S. tuberosum (TBR). For freezing resistance, killing temperatures both under non-acclimated and under acclimated conditions were determined using the ion leakage procedure. Values for the hybrids were distributed between the wild and cultivated parental values. Some hybrids displayed an acclimation capacity close to 2.5 degrees C, typical of hardy species. Artificial inoculation of tubers with Pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum (formerly Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora) provided evidence of variability in disease response. Highly resistant hybrids were identified. After conventional phenotypic selection, wild genome content was estimated based on the presence of CMM-specific AFLP fragments. Seven primer combinations were used (Eco-AGGIMse-CAA; Eco-ACCIMse-CAT; Eco-ACTIMse-CAC; Eco-ACTIMse-CAG; EcoACT/Mse-CAA; Eco-ACTIMse-CAT; Eco-AGGIMse-CAG). The percentages of CMM-specific AFLPs ranged frorn 4.3% to 56.7%, with an average value of 28.1 %. AFLP analysis was employed for the selection of the hybrids to be used for further breeding objectives.	2007	10.1270/jsbbs.57.145		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Caseys, Celine; Glauser, Gaetan; Stoelting, Kai N.; Christe, Camille; Albrectsen, Benedicte R.; Lexer, Christian	Effects of interspecific recombination on functional traits in trees revealed by metabolomics and genotyping-by-resequencing	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY	Background: Understanding the potential and limits of recombination in adaptive evolution is of great interest to evolutionary biology. New (ultra-) high-throughput technologies in metabolomics and genomics hold great promise for addressing these questions, but their use in interspecific hybrids remains largely unexplored. Aims: Our goal was to test if recombination between the highly divergent genomes of Populus alba and P. tremula has the potential to contribute to the standing variation for functionally important chemical traits. Methods: We studied the metabolomes of interspecific hybrids by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and initiated the characterisation of hybrid genomes by restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Results: UHPLC-QTOF-MS indicated a complex 'mosaic' of chemical traits in recombinant hybrids and pointed to a heritable component for many of these. RAD sequencing confirmed the recombinant nature of natural hybrids previously characterised by microsatellites and suggested a complex history of recombination. Conclusions: It is likely that hybridisation has affected these species' genomes over several glacial cycles. Recombination holds great potential to create functionally relevant chemical variation in these trees. Nevertheless, correlations between chemical traits are not entirely broken up in recombinant hybrids, suggesting limits to adaptive evolution by genetic exchange.	2012	10.1080/17550874.2012.748850		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	pseudo admixture mapping	FALSE			FALSE	
Castillo, Almudena; Atienza, Sergio G.; Martin, Azahara C.	Fertility of CMS wheat is restored by two Rf loci located on a recombined acrocentric chromosome	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) results from incompatibility between nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, and is characterized by the inability to produce viable pollen. The restoration of male fertility generally involves the introgression of nuclear genes, termed restorers of fertility (Rf). CMS has been widely used for hybrid seed production in many crops but not in wheat, partly owing to the complex genetics of fertility restoration. In this study, an acrocentric chromosome that restores pollen fertility of CMS wheat in Hordeum chilense cytoplasm (msH1 system) is studied. The results show that this chromosome, of H. chilense origin and named H(ch)ac, originated from a complex reorganization of the short arm of chromosomes 1H(ch) (1H(ch)S) and 6H(ch) (6H(ch)S). Diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers and cytological analysis indicate that H(ch)ac is a kind of 'zebra-like 'chromosome composed of chromosome 1H(ch)S and alternate fragments of interstitial and distal regions of chromosome 6H(ch)S. PCR-based markers together with FISH, GISH, and meiotic pairing analysis support this result. A restorer of fertility gene, named Rf6H(ch)S, has been identified on the short arm of chromosome 6H(ch)S. Moreover, restoration by the addition of chromosome 1H(ch)S has been observed at a very low frequency and under certain environmental conditions. Therefore, the results indicate the presence of two Rf genes on the acrocentric chromosome: Rf6H(ch)S and Rf1H(ch)S, the restoration potential of Rf6H(ch)S being greater. The stable and high restoration of pollen fertility in the msH1 system is therefore the result of the interaction between these two restorer genes.	2014	10.1093/jxb/eru388		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Castillo, Almudena; Ramirez, Maria C.; Martin, Azahara C.; Kilian, Andrzej; Martin, Antonio; Atienza, Sergio G.	High-throughput genotyping of wheat-barley amphiploids utilising diversity array technology (DArT)	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Hordeum chilense, a native South American diploid wild barley, is one of the species of the genus Hordeum with a high potential for cereal breeding purposes, given its high crossability with other members of the Triticeae tribe. Hexaploid tritordeum (xTritordeum Ascherson et Graebner, 2n=6x=42, AABBH(ch)H(ch)) is the fertile amphiploid obtained after chromosome doubling of hybrids between Hordeum chilense and durum wheat. Approaches used in the improvement of this crop have included crosses with hexaploid wheat to promote D/H-ch chromosome substitutions. While this approach has been successful as was the case with triticale, it has also complicated the genetic composition of the breeding materials. Until now tritordeum lines were analyzed based on molecular cytogenetic techniques and screening with a small set of DNA markers. However, the recent development of DArT markers in H. chilense offers new possibilities to screen large number of accessions more efficiently. Results: Here, we have applied DArT markers to genotype composition in forty-six accessions of hexaploid tritordeum originating from different stages of tritordeum breeding program and to H. chilense-wheat chromosome addition lines to allow their physical mapping. Diversity analyses were conducted including dendrogram construction, principal component analysis and structure inference. Euploid and substituted tritordeums were clearly discriminated independently of the method used. However, dendrogram and Structure analyses allowed the clearest discrimination among substituted tritordeums. The physically mapped markers allowed identifying these groups as substituted tritordeums carrying the following disomic substitutions (DS): DS1D (1H(ch)), DS2D (2H(ch)), DS5D (5H(ch)), DS6D (6H(ch)) and the double substitution DS2D (2H(ch)), DS5D (5H(ch)). These results were validated using chromosome specific EST and SSR markers and GISH analysis. Conclusion: In conclusion, DArT markers have proved to be very useful to detect chromosome substitutions in the tritordeum breeding program and thus they are expected to be equally useful to detect translocations both in the tritordeum breeding program and in the transference of H. chilense genetic material in wheat breeding programs.	2013	10.1186/1471-2229-13-87		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Segregation distortion and genome-wide digenic interactions affect transmission of introgressed chromatin from wild cotton species	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	This study reports transmission genetics of chromosomal segments into Gossypium hirsutum from its most distant euploid relative, Gossypium mustelinum . Mutilocus interactions and structural rearrangements affect introgression and segregation of donor chromatin. Wild allotetraploid relatives of cotton are a rich source of genetic diversity that can be used in genetic improvement, but linkage drag and non-Mendelian transmission genetics are prevalent in interspecific crosses. These problems necessitate knowledge of transmission patterns of chromatin from wild donor species in cultivated recipient species. From an interspecific cross, Gossypium hirsutum x Gossypium mustelinum, we studied G. mustelinum (the most distant tetraploid relative of Upland cotton) allele retention in 35 BC3F1 plants and segregation patterns in BC3F2 populations totaling 3202 individuals, using 216 DNA marker loci. The average retention of donor alleles across BC3F1 plants was higher than expected and the average frequency of G. mustelinum alleles in BC3F2 segregating families was less than expected. Despite surprisingly high retention of G. mustelinum alleles in BC3F1, 46 genomic regions showed no introgression. Regions on chromosomes 3 and 15 lacking introgression were closely associated with possible small inversions previously reported. Nonlinear two-locus interactions are abundant among loci with single-locus segregation distortion, and among loci originating from one of the two subgenomes. Comparison of the present results with those of prior studies indicates different permeability of Upland cotton for donor chromatin from different allotetraploid relatives. Different contributions of subgenomes to two-locus interactions suggest different fates of subgenomes in the evolution of allotetraploid cottons. Transmission genetics of G. hirsutum x G. mustelinum crosses reveals allelic interactions, constraints on fixation and selection of donor alleles, and challenges with retention of introgressed chromatin for crop improvement.	2017	10.1007/s00122-017-2952-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Developing a maize genotype with a combination of higher lysine and tryptophan, along with beta-carotene, can help alleviate the problem of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) and vitamin A deficiency (VAD). This study is aimed at improving lysine and tryptophan content by transferring opaque-2 (o2) gene from donor HKI163 to beta-carotene-rich inbred lines viz., UMI1200 beta(+) and UMI1230 beta+. For this purpose, F-1, BC1F1, BC2F1, BC2F2, and BC2F3 plants were developed using an o2 line HKI163 and two beta-carotene-rich inbred lines, UMI1200 beta(+) and UMI1230 beta(+), as the parents. Foreground selection using the associated marker umc1066 for the o2 gene and the marker crtRB1 3'TE for the crtRB1 gene was used to select the target genes. A total of 236 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers distributed evenly across the maize genome were employed for the background selection. To fix the crtRB1 allele in the BC1F1 stage, individual plants homozygous at the crtRB1 locus and heterozygous at the o2 locus were selected and used for backcrossing to produce BC2F1 plants. Furthermore, the selected heterozygous BC2F1 plants from both crosses were selfed to obtain the BC2F2 plants, which were then selected for the target gene and selfed to generate the BC2F3 lines. From each cross, five improved lines with homozygous marker alleles for the crtRB1 and o2 genes with a recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery ranging from 86.75 to 91.21% in UMI1200 beta(+) xHKI163 and 80.00 to 90.08% in UMI1230 beta(+) xHKI163 were identified. The improved lines had good agronomic performance and possessed high lysine (0.294-0.332%), tryptophan (0.073-0.081%), and beta-carotene (6.12-7.38 mu g/g) content. These improved lines can be used as genetic resources for maize improvement.	2019	10.3389/fgene.2019.00859		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chapman, M. A.; Hiscock, S. J.; Filatov, D. A.	The genomic bases of morphological divergence and reproductive isolation driven by ecological speciation in Senecio (Asteraceae)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Ecological speciation, driven by adaptation to contrasting environments, provides an attractive opportunity to study the formation of distinct species, and the role of selection and genomic divergence in this process. Here, we focus on a particularly clear-cut case of ecological speciation to reveal the genomic bases of reproductive isolation and morphological differences between closely related Senecio species, whose recent divergence within the last similar to 200000years was likely driven by the uplift of Mt. Etna (Sicily). These species form a hybrid zone, yet remain morphologically and ecologically distinct, despite active gene exchange. Here, we report a high-density genetic map of the Senecio genome and map hybrid breakdown to one large and several small quantitative trait loci (QTL). Loci under diversifying selection cluster in three 5 cM regions which are characterized by a significant increase in relative (F-ST), but not absolute (d(XY)), interspecific differentiation. They also correspond to some of the regions of greatest marker density, possibly corresponding to cold-spots' of recombination, such as centromeres or chromosomal inversions. Morphological QTL for leaf and floral traits overlap these clusters. We also detected three genomic regions with significant transmission ratio distortion (TRD), possibly indicating accumulation of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities between these recently diverged species. One of the TRD regions overlapped with a cluster of high species differentiation, and another overlaps the large QTL for hybrid breakdown, indicating that divergence of these species may have occurred due to a complex interplay of ecological divergence and accumulation of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities.	2016	10.1111/jeb.12765		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Chatterjee, Debamalya; Banga, Shashi; Gupta, Mehak; Bharti, Sakshi; Salisbury, Phillip Anthony; Banga, Surinder Singh	Resynthesis of Brassica napus through hybridization between B-juncea and B-carinata	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Key message First report for the resynthesis of Brassica napus by recombining A and C genome from B. juncea and B. carinata , respectively. Also documents B genome introgressions in resynthesized B. napus. Resynthesis of Brassica napus (AACC) was achieved by hybridizing Brassica juncea (AABB) with Brassica carinata (BBCC). This was facilitated by spontaneous chromosome doubling in the F-1 hybrid (ABBC) to yield octaploid (AABBBBCC), elimination of extra B genome chromosomes in the resulting octaploid and in subsequent selfed generations, aided with directed selection for fertile plants having B. napus morphology. Twenty-five plants with varying degrees of resemblance to natural B. napus were identified from 17 A(5) progenies and assayed for cytogenetic stability and genetic diversity. Majority of these plants, except six (2n = 38) were hyperploids (2n = 40-56). The six plants with 2n = 38 were designated as derived B. napus types. These showed an expected meiotic configuration of 19II at metaphase-I, with 19-19 distribution at anaphase-I. Genotyping based on A and C genome specific primers confirmed genetic identity of six derived (2n = 38) B. napus plants with natural types whereas genotyping with B genome specific primers indicated introgression of B genome segments. This was also confirmed by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Strong signals of B genome probe were detected, proving hitherto unreported genetic exchanges between B and A/C chromosomes. These introgressions possibly occurred en route five generations of selfing. Derived plants yielded fertile hybrids in crosses with natural B. napus var. GSC 6. The selfed derived plants as evaluated in A(6) plant to progeny rows were morphologically similar to natural B. napus, and meiotically stable. Agronomic assessment of these progenies revealed variation for key morpho-physiological traits. Of special interest were the progenies with plants having oil content exceeding 47 % as against about 39-41 % in existing cultivars.	2016	10.1007/s00122-016-2677-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chee, PW; Draye, X; Jiang, CX; Decanini, L; Delmonte, TA; Bredhauer, R; Smith, CW; Paterson, AH	Molecular dissection of phenotypic variation between Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense (cotton) by a backcross-self approach: III. Fiber length	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	A backcross-self population from a cross between Gossypium hirsutum and G. barbadense was used to dissect the molecular basis of genetic variation governing 15 parameters that reflect fiber length. Applying a detailed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) map to 3,662 BC3F2 plants from 24 independently derived BC3 families, we detected 28, nine, and eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fiber length, length uniformity, and short fiber content, respectively. For eight, six, and two chromosomal regions containing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for fiber length, length uniformity, and short fiber content (respectively), two-way analysis of variance showed a significant (P < 0.001) among-family genotypic effect. A total of 13, two, and four loci showed genotype X family interaction, illustrating some of the complexities that are likely to be faced in introgression of exotic germplasm into the gene pool of cultivated cotton. Co-location of many QTLs for fiber length, length uniformity, and short fiber content accounted for correlations among these traits, while the discovery of many QTLs unique to each trait suggests that maximum genetic gain will require breeding efforts that target each trait (or an index including all three). The availability of DNA markers linked to G. barbadense QTLs identified in this and other studies promise to assist breeders in transferring and maintaining valuable traits from exotic sources during cultivar development.	2005	10.1007/s00122-005-2062-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Hai-Feng; Wang, Hua; Li, Zai-Yun	Production and genetic analysis of partial hybrids in intertribal crosses between Brassica species (B-rapa, B-napus) and Capsella bursa-pastoris	PLANT CELL REPORTS	Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medic (2n = 4x = 32) is a natural double-low (erucic acid < 1%, glucosinolates < 30 mu mol/g) germplasm and shows high degree of resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Hybridizations were carried out between two Brassica species viz. B. rapa (2n = 20) and B. napus (2n = 38) as female and C. bursa-pastoris as male parent to introduce these desirable traits into cultivated Brassica species. Majority of F-1 plants resembled female parents in morphology and only a few expressed some characters of male parent, including the white petals. Based on cytological observation of somatic cells, the F-1 plants were classified into five types: two types from the cross with B. rapa, type I had 2n = 27-29; type II had 2n = 20; three types from the crosses with B. napus, type III was haploids with 2n = 19; type IV had 2n = 29; type V had 2n = 38. One to two chromosomes of C. bursa-pastoris were detected in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of type I plant by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), together with chromosomal segments in ovary cells and PMCs of some F-1 plants. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) bands specific for the male parent, novel for two parents and absent bands in Brassica parents were generated in majority of F-1 plants, even in Brassica-types and haploids, indicating the introgressions at various levels from C. bursa-pastoris and genomic alterations following hybridization. Some Brassica-type progeny plants had reduced contents of erucic acid and glucosinolates associated with improved resistance to S. sclerotiorum. The cytological and molecular mechanisms behind these results are discussed.	2007	10.1007/s00299-007-0392-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Jian-wen; Lao, Fang-ye; Chen, Xi-wen; Deng, Hai-hua; Liu, Rui; He, Hui-yi; Fu, Cheng; Chen, Yong-sheng; Liu, Fu-ye; Li, Qi-wei; Jackson, Phillip; Aitken, Karen	DNA Marker Transmission and Linkage Analysis in Populations Derived from a Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) x Erianthus arundinaceus Hybrid	PLOS ONE	Introgression of Erianthus arundinaceus has been the focus of several sugarcane breeding programs in the world, because the species has desirable traits such as high biomass production, vigour, ratooning ability and good resistance to environmental stresses and disease. In this study four genetic maps were constructed for two intergeneric populations. The first population (BC1) was generated from a cross between an Erianthus/Saccharum hybrid YC96-40 and a commercial sugarcane variety CP84-1198. The second population (BC2) was generated from a cross between YCE01-116, a progeny of the BC1 cross and NJ57-416, a commercial sugarcane cultivar. Markers across both populations were generated using 35 AFLP and 23 SSR primer pairs. A total of 756 and 728 polymorphic markers were scored in the BC1 and BC2 populations, respectively. In the BC1 population, a higher proportion of markers was derived from the Erianthus ancestor than those from the Saccharum ancestor Badila. In the BC2 population, both the number and proportion of markers derived from Erianthus were approximately half of those in the BC1 population. Linkage analysis led to the construction of 38, 57, 36 and 47 linkage groups (LGs) for YC96-40, CP84-1198, YCE01-116, and NJ57-416, encompassing 116, 174, 97 and 159 markers (including single dose, double dose and bi-parental markers), respectively. These LGs could be further placed into four, five, five and six homology groups (HGs), respectively, based on information from multi-allelic SSR markers and repulsion phase linkages detected between LGs. Analysis of repulsion phase linkage indicated that Erianthus behaved like a true autopolyploid.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0128865		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Liangming; Zhao, Zhigang; Liu, Xi; Liu, Linglong; Jiang, Ling; Liu, Shijia; Zhang, Wenwei; Wang, Yihua; Liu, Yuqiang; Wan, Jianmin	Marker-assisted breeding of a photoperiod-sensitive male sterile japonica rice with high cross-compatibility with indica rice	MOLECULAR BREEDING	The incomplete fertility of japonica x indica rice hybrids has inhibited breeders' access to the substantial heterotic potential of these hybrids. As hybrid sterility is caused by an allelic interaction at a small number of loci, it is possible to overcome it by simple introgression at the major sterility loci. Here we report the use of marker-assisted backcrossing to transfer into the elite japonica cv. Zhendao88 a photoperiod-sensitive male sterility gene from cv. Lunhui422S (indica) and the yellow leaf gene from line Yellow249 (indica). The microsatellite markers RM276, RM455, RM141 and RM185 were used to tag the fertility genes S5, S8, S7 and S9, respectively. Line 509S is a true-breeding photoperiod-sensitive male sterile plant, which morphologically closely resembles the japonica type. Genotypic analysis showed that the genome of line 509S comprises about 92% japonica DNA. Nevertheless, hybrids between line 509S and japonica varieties suffer from a level of hybrid sterility, although the line is highly cross-compatible with indica types, with the resulting hybrids expressing a significant degree of heterosis. Together, these results suggest that segment substitution on fertility loci based on known information and marker-assisted selection are an effective approach for utilizing the heterosis of rice inter-subspecies.	2011	10.1007/s11032-010-9427-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Lin; Guo, Xianpu; Wang, Haibo; Xie, Conghua; Cai, Xingkui; He, Li; Zhou, Jun; Liu, Jun	Tetrasomic inheritance pattern of the pentaploid Solanum chacoense (+) S. tuberosum somatic hybrid (resistant to bacterial wilt) revealed by SSR detected alleles	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE	Protoplast fusion may be used to introgress desirable traits from wild species into cultivated potato which are cross incompatible. However, none of commercial varieties have been developed from hyper-tetraploid somatic hybrids because of the unpredictable heredity associated with irregular chromosome segregation during meiosis. A pentaploid somatic hybrid (SH) from Solanum chacoense + S. tuberosum, 3C28-1, which carries bacterial wilt (BW) resistance from the wild species, was employed in the present research. Gamete genotypes and inheritance pattern of SH 3C28-1 were estimated by counting the chromosome numbers and detecting the parent-specific SSR alleles in a backcross population of SH 3C28-1 x E-Potato 1 (variety) which is BW susceptible. The SSR alleles retained from S. chacoense were analyzed for association with BW resistance and evaluation of wild species genetic background. Our results implied that SH 3C28-1 could produce viable gametes of n = 2x = 24 + a where a aecurrency sign 6, which are compatible with a tetraploid pollen source to yield a high proportion of tetraploids and aneuploids with chromosome numbers between 48 and 54. Sixty-four of 83 SH 3C28-1-specific SSR alleles fit the tetrasomic or disomic/tetrasomic segregation ratio of a tetraploid, suggesting that the pentaploid mainly exhibits tetraploid inheritance pattern. Four (three positive and one negative) alleles were estimated to associate with BW resistance and backcross clones were selected for preserving less wild species genetic background and harboring the resistance. The present research elucidates the inheritance pattern of the pentaploid somatic hybrid to provide a theoretical and applied foundation for use of the pentaploid in potato breeding.	2016	10.1007/s11240-016-1051-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Q	Detection of alien chromatin introgression from Thinopyrum into wheat using S genomic DNA as a probe - A landmark approach for Thinopyrum genome research	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	The introduction of alien genetic variation from the genus Thinopyrum through chromosome engineering into wheat is a valuable and proven technique for wheat improvement. A number of economically important traits have been transferred into wheat as single genes, chromosome arms or entire chromosomes. Successful transfers can be greatly assisted by the precise identification of alien chromatin in the recipient progenies. Chromosome identification and characterization are useful for genetic manipulation and transfer in wheat breeding following chromosome engineering. Genomic in situ hybridization ( GISH) using an S genomic DNA probe from the diploid species Pseudoroegneria has proven to be a powerful diagnostic cytogenetic tool for monitoring the transfer of many promising agronomic traits from Thinopyrum. This specific S genomic probe not only allows the direct determination of the chromosome composition in wheat-Thinopyrum hybrids, but also can separate the Th. intermedium chromosomes into the J, J(S) and S genomes. The J(S) genome, which consists of a modified J genome chromosome distinguished by S genomic sequences of Pseudoroegneria near the centromere and telomere, carries many disease and mite resistance genes. Utilization of this S genomic probe leads to a better understanding of genomic affinities between Thinopyrum and wheat, and provides a molecular cytogenetic marker for monitoring the transfer of alien Thinopyrum agronomic traits into wheat recipient lines.

Chen, S.; Zou, J.; Cowling, W. A.; Meng, J.	Allelic diversity in a novel gene pool of canola-quality Brassica napus enriched with alleles from B. rapa and B. carinata	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE	Brassica napus is an amphidiploid with genome AACC and is relatively deficient in genetic diversity. The abundant genetic diversity in other A- and C-genome Brassica species is a valuable resource to expand the narrow gene pool of B. napus. Recently the A(r) genomic components from Chinese B. rapa (A(r)A(r)) and C(c) genomic components from Ethiopian mustard B. carinata (BBC(c)C(c)) were introgressed into B. napus through interspecific hybridisation, and the A(r)/C(c) components were enriched through two generations of molecular marker-assisted selection. In this study, the simple sequence repeat (SSR) allelic diversity of 29 of these new-type B. napus lines, 12 from the first generation and 17 from the second generation, was compared with 66 international B. napus varieties from Australia, China and other countries. Hierarchical clustering and two-dimensional multidimensional scaling revealed that second generation lines and a few first generation lines, all selected for high A(r)/C(c) components, formed a unique population that was distantly separated from international B. napus. This novel gene pool had significantly higher richness of private SSR alleles and more alleles per SSR marker than the international B. napus varieties. The new-type B. napus lines showed variation in agronomic traits beyond the canola-quality B. napus parent. Many of the lines had low erucic acid and low glucosinolates in the seed (canola quality), indicating that they could be utilised immediately in canola breeding programs.	2010	10.1071/CP09327		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Wei; Yao, Jinbo; Li, Yan; Zhu, Shouhong; Guo, Yan; Fang, Shengtao; Zhao, Lanjie; Wang, Junyi; Yuan, Li; Lu, Youjun; Zhang, Yongshan	Open-Bud Duplicate Loci Are Identified as MML10s, Orthologs of MIXTA-Like Genes on Homologous Chromosomes of Allotetraploid Cotton	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	The open-bud (ob) mutants in cotton display abnormal flower buds with the stigma and upper anthers exposed before blooming. This characteristic is potentially useful for the efficient production of hybrid seeds. The recessive inheritance pattern of the ob phenotype in allotetraploid cotton is determined by duplicated recessive loci (ob1ob1ob2ob2). In this study, ob1, which is a MIXTA-like MYB gene on chromosome D13 (MML10_Dt), was identified by map-based cloning. In Gossypium barbadense (Gb) acc. 3-79, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (G/A) at the splice site of the first intron and an 8-bp deletion in the third exon of MML10_Dt were found, which are the causative mutations at the ob1 loci. A 1783-bp deletion that leads to the loss of the third exon and accounts for the causal variation at the ob2 loci was found in MML10_At of Gossypium hirsutum (Gh) acc. TM-1. The ob phenotype results from the combination of these two loss-of-function loci. Genotyping assays showed that the ob1 and ob2 loci appeared after the formation of allotetraploid cotton and were specific for Gb and Gh, respectively. All Gb lines and most Gh cultivars carry the single corresponding mutant alleles. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed that some of the MYB genes and genes related to cell wall biogenesis, trichome differentiation, cytokinin signal transduction, and cell division were repressed in the ob mutants, which may lead to suppression of petal growth. These findings should be of value for breeding superior ob lines in cotton.	2020	10.3389/fpls.2020.00081		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Xin; Li, Maoteng; Shi, Jiaqin; Fu, Donghui; Qian, Wei; Zou, Jun; Zhang, Chunyu; Meng, Jinling	Gene expression profiles associated with intersubgenomic heterosis in Brassica napus	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	In order to understand the genetic mechanism of heterosis that has been observed in hybrids between Brassica napus and partial new-type B. napus which had exotic genome components from relative species, this study focused on the difference in gene expression patterns among partial new-typed B. napus lines, B. napus cultivars and their hybrids using the cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism technique (cDNA-AFLP) technique. First, three partial new-type B. napus lines were compared with their original parents. One new line contained the exotic genomic components from B. rapa, and the other two new lines were obtained by the introgression of genomic components from B. rapa and B. carinata. The experimental results showed that the introgression of A(r) and C-c genome components from B. rapa and B. carinata led to considerable differences in the gene expression profiles of the partial new-type lines when compared with their parents. Secondly, the gene expression profiles of nine cross-combinations between three partial new-type lines and three B. napus cultivars were compared. Twenty transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) associated with intersubgenomic heterosis were randomly selected and converted into PCR-based molecular markers. Some of them were mapped in the confidence intervals of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and yield-related traits in three segregative populations of B. napus. These results suggested that a proportion of the heterosis-associated TDFs were really responsible for fluctuating seed yield in rapeseed.	2008	10.1007/s00122-008-0842-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression/elite lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Ying; Gong, Biran; Xi, Ling; Tang, Lin; Zhu, Wei; Xu, Lili; Zeng, Jian; Wang, Yi; Fan, Xing; Sha, Lina; Chen, Guoyue; Zhang, Haiqin; Zhou, Yonghong; Kang, Houyang	Effective <bold>introgression</bold> of wheat D-genome chromosomes into hexaploid triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) using trigeneric hybrids	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Given the narrow genetic variability of hexaploid triticale, introgressive hybridization is an efficient means to enrich the available genetic pool. The wheat D-genome chromosomes harbor valuable genes for triticale improvement, such as enhancement of biotic and abiotic stress resistance, bread baking quality, and agronomically useful characters. Introducing the wheat D-genome chromosome into triticale may thus improve its agronomic performance and quality. In the present study, we successfully developed the six hexaploid triticale D-genome chromosome introgression lines derived from wheat-rye-Psathyrostachys huashanica trigeneric hybrids. Genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (GISH and FISH) karyotyping revealed that K16-4173-3, K16-1565-6, K16-1565-7, and K16-601-1 were 2D(2R), 3D(3B), 3D, 5D(3B, 5R), and 5D(5B) chromosome substitution lines, respectively. K16-4121-3 was found to be a disomic chromosome addition line having a pair of 6D chromosomes. In addition, line K16-1566-4 carried 28 A- and B-genome, 12 R-genome (lacking two 4Rs), two 4D, and two 7D chromosomes. Analysis of these lines using wheat simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and rye specific molecular markers confirmed that corresponding triticale B or R chromosomes had been replaced by D chromosomes of wheat, an observation perfectly consistent with the FISH and GISH results. Furthermore, these lines except for K16-601-1 were highly resistant to the stripe rust pathogen prevalent in China, than Zhongsi828 plants at the adult stages. Our data suggest that the use of trigeneric hybrids as a bridge between triticale and amphiploid wild-wheat forms is an effect strategy for transferring D-genome chromatin into triticale from other breeding programs. The triticale D-genome introgression lines created in this study may serve as new bridging germplasm for hexaploid triticale breeding and should likewise be useful for enhancing triticale genetic diversity.	2019	10.1007/s11032-019-0990-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chen, Yu; Chen, Yu; Feng, Shouli; Zhao, Ting; Zhou, Baoliang	Overcoming obstacles to interspecific hybridization between Gossypium hirsutum and G. turneri	EUPHYTICA	Gossypium turneri, a wild cotton species (2n = 2X = 26, D10D10) originating from Mexico, possesses invaluable characteristics unavailable in the cultivated tetraploid cotton gene pool, such as caducous involucels at anthesis, resistance to insects and tolerance to abiotic stresses. However, transferring desired characteristics from wild species into cultivated cotton is often fraught with diverse obstacles. Here, Gossypium hirsutum (as the maternal parent) and G. turneri were crossed in the Hainan Province of China, and the obtained hybrid seeds (2n = 3X = 39, ADD(10)) were treated with 0.075% colchicine solution for 48 h to double the chromosome complement in order to overcome triploid F-1 sterility and to generate a fertile hexaploid. Chromosome doubling was successful in four individuals. However, the new synthetic hexaploids derived from these individuals were still highly sterile, and no seeds were generated by selfing or crossing. Therefore, an embryo rescue technique was employed in an attempt to produce progenies from the new synthetic hexaploids. Consequently, a total of six large embryos were obtained on MSB2K medium supplemented with 0.5 mg l(-1) KIN and 250 mg l(-1) CH using ovules from backcrossing that were 3 days post-anthesis. Four grafted surviving seedlings were confirmed to be the progenies (pentaploids) of the new synthetic hexaploids using cytological observations and molecular markers. Eight putative fertile individuals derived from backcrossing the above pentaploids were confirmed using SSR markers and generated an abundance of normal seeds. This research lays a foundation for transferring desirable characteristics from G. turneri into upland cotton.	2018	10.1007/s10681-018-2118-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Cheng, A.; Cui, H.; Xia, G.	Construction of a primary RH panel of Italian ryegrass genome via UV-induced protoplast fusion	PLANT BIOLOGY	Symmetric and asymmetric somatic hybrids were produced via protoplast fusion between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. "Jinan 177" and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.). The ryegrass without or with UV irradiation was used as a donor, providing a small amount of chromatin. In these somatic hybrids, most ryegrass chromosomes have been confirmed preferential elimination and the somatic hybrid calli and plants showed wheat-like morphology. Some of the hybrid lines were used for the analysis of distribution and heredity of donor DNA in the hybrid genome and the possibility of establishing a radiation hybrid (RH) panel of the ryegrass in the present experiment. These hybrids, subcultured for two and three years, retained the ryegrass DNA examined by RFLP and GISH analysis, respectively. Distribution of the ryegrass DNA in the wheat genomes of 20 single-cell individuals, randomly selected from hybrid cell lines produced, were analyzed by 21 ryegrass genome specific SSR markers. The average frequencies of molecular marker retention in symmetric hybrid lines (UV 0), as well as asymmetric hybrid lines from UV 30 s and 1 min were 10.88, 15.48 and 33.86, respectively. It was suggested that the UV dose increased the introgression of donor DNA into wheat genome. The ryegrass SSR fragments in most asymmetric hybrid cell lines remained stable over a period of 2 similar to 3 years. This revealed that those asymmetric somatic hybrids are suitable for the introgression of ryegrass DNA into wheat, and for RH panel and RH mapping.	2006	10.1055/s-2006-924276		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Cheng, Mingjun; Zheng, Mingmin; Yang, Shipeng; Li, Yang; Dong, Xingchun; Li, Jing; Sun, Rulong; Li, Huaxiong; Zhou, Shufeng; Wu, Yuanqi; Rong, Tingzhao; Tang, Qilin	The effect of different genome and cytoplasm on meiotic pairing in maize newly synthetic polyploids	EUPHYTICA	Allopolyploidization plays the special role in the evolution of many crops. Moreover, the evolution in early stage of some allopolyploidization events is predicted to be effected by nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Maize and teosintes are well model system for study of genetic recombination in allopolyploidization. In order to investigate the effects of genome organization and cytoplasm on genome evolution in newly synthesized allopolyploids (neoallopolyploids), a series of neoallopolyploids were produced by reciprocal crosses of maize and Zea perennis. By using dual-color genomic in situ hybridization, intra- and intergenomic meiosis pairing of these polyploids were quantified and compared with regard to its genome organization and cytoplasm background. In the four neoallopolyploids, the stability of maize genome is consistently lower than that of Z. perennis genome. Additional, the stability of maize genome is affected by genome ploidy. The cytoplasm, genome composition and their interaction do have the special role in chromosome paring and the meiosis behaviors in Zea allopolyploids vary significantly and showed non-diploidization. Z. perennis cytoplasm may give a relatively relaxed environment for maize genome.	2016	10.1007/s10681-015-1552-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Cheng, Yueh-Yun; Fang, Shao-An; Lin, Yao-Cheng; Chung, Mei-Chu	A repetitive sequence specific to Oryza species with BB genome and abundant in Oryza punctata Kotschy ex Steud	BOTANICAL STUDIES	Molecular markers are capable of discriminating specific constituents of genome and monitoring genomic introgression of interspecific hybrids. In this study, we isolate and characterize a 1313 genome specific RAPD, Opun210, from Oryza punctata Kotschy ex Steud (W 1593), an African native wild rice. We demonstrate the Qpun210 as a highly species-specific marker. The Opun210 sequence is 789 base pairs in length and estimated at 5.3 x 10(4) copies in O. puntata (W 1593) haploid genome, which contains the most repeats of Opun210 among Oryza species. The results of DNA sequence alignments among Opun210 and a few hits in the GenBank found that a relatively high similarity was in position similar to 500 nucleotides regions at the 5 ' ends, but a low similarity was in the rest of the nucleotides at the 3 ' ends. SCAR-PCR profiles indicates that this fragment was specific to BB genome. Furthermore, the Opun210 sequence at position 430 similar to 480 nucleotides putatively encodes a peptide with 88% identity to a Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon protein or a peptide with 94% identity to a hypothetical protein. The results of Southern hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that the repetitive Opun210 sequences dispersed throughout the entire genome of O. punctata. The origin and divergence of the Qpun210 sequence in genus Oryza is discussed based on the investigations in this study.	2007			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Chetelat, Roger T.	Overcoming sterility and unilateral incompatibility of Solanum lycopersicum x S-sitiens hybrids	EUPHYTICA	The wild tomato relative Solanum sitiens is a rare endemic plant of the Atacama Desert of Chile. This species exhibits unique traits-tolerance to drought, salinity and low temperatures, resistances to certain pathogens, and modified fruit ripening-that could be of interest to tomato breeders. However, strong reproductive barriers, including hybrid inviability, sterility, and unilateral incompatibility (UI), prevent or impede introgression with cultivated tomato. Using embryo culture, we obtained a large number of F-1 S. lycopersicum x S. sitiens hybrids, and evaluated their fertility and compatibility as male or female parents. Diploid hybrids were functionally male-sterile and strongly rejected pollen of S. lycopersicum by UI. Chromosome doubling produced fertile allotetraploids, from which allotriploids (two genomes of S. lycopersicum, one of S. sitiens) were derived by crossing to diploid tomato. Rejection of tomato pollen occurred lower in styles of allotriploid than diploid hybrids. The pollen compatibility factors ui1.1 and ui6.1 were not sufficient for compatibility on S. sitiens allotriploid hybrids, unlike comparable hybrids with S. lycopersicoides. Pollen from F-1 S. lycopersicum x S. pennellii was used to overcome UI on pistils of diploid S. lycopersicum x S. sitiens hybrids. This cross yielded progeny that were fertile and compatible in direct backcrosses to S. lycopersicum. These results establish a feasible method for transferring the S. sitiens genome into cultivated tomato.	2016	10.1007/s10681-015-1543-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chetelat, Roger T.; Qin, Xiaoqiong; Tan, Meilian; Burkart-Waco, Diana; Moritama, Yosuke; Huo, Xiuwen; Wills, Tim; Pertuze, Ricardo	Introgression lines of Solanum sitiens, a wild nightshade of the Atacama Desert, in the genome of cultivated tomato	PLANT JOURNAL	The wild tomato relative Solanum sitiens is a xerophyte endemic to the Atacama Desert of Chile and a potential source of genes for tolerance to drought, salinity and low-temperature stresses. However, until recently, strong breeding barriers prevented its hybridization and introgression with cultivated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L. We overcame these barriers using embryo rescue, bridging lines and allopolyploid hybrids, and synthesized a library of introgression lines (ILs) that captures the genome of S. sitiens in the background of cultivated tomato. The IL library consists of 56 overlapping introgressions that together represent about 93% of the S. sitiens genome: 65% in homozygous and 28% in heterozygous (segregating) ILs. The breakpoints of each segment and the gaps in genome coverage were mapped by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using the SolCAP SNP array. Marker-assisted selection was used to backcross selected introgressions into tomato, to recover a uniform genetic background, to isolate recombinant sub-lines with shorter introgressions and to select homozygous genotypes. Each IL contains a single S. sitiens chromosome segment, defined by markers, in the genetic background of cv. NC 84173, a fresh market inbred line. Large differences were observed between the lines for both qualitative and quantitative morphological traits, suggesting that the ILs contain highly divergent allelic variation. Several loci contributing to unilateral incompatibility or hybrid necrosis were mapped with the lines. This IL population will facilitate studies of the S. sitiens genome and expands the range of genetic variation available for tomato breeding and research.	2019	10.1111/tpj.14460		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Chimote, Vivek P.; Chakrabarti, Swarup K.; Pattanayak, Debasis; Pandey, Suman K.; Naik, Prakash S.	Molecular analysis of cytoplasm type in Indian potato varieties	EUPHYTICA	Thirty-eight Indian potato varieties and fifty-two advanced hybrid lines were analyzed for cytoplasm types using both plastid and mitochondrial genome specific markers. Indian genotypes thus analysed could be broadly grouped into 4 cytoplasm types i.e. T/beta (69), W/alpha (18), W/gamma (1) and A/epsilon (2). The T/beta type cytoplasm, typical of common cultivated potato (ssp. tuberosum) was absent in six released varieties (Kufri Chipsona-1/-2/-3 series, Kufri Jawahar, Kufri Megha and Kufri Himalini) and fifteen out of fifty two hybrids analyzed. This information was further used to predict cytoplasm type on the basis of common shared maternal pedigree in thirty-eight other advanced hybrids, which revealed majority (25) had T/beta type cytoplasm with W/alpha and A/epsilon cytoplasm observed in 12 and 1 genotype, respectively. T/beta type cytoplasm was observed in all 28 early bulking hybrids studied along with all old genotypes. It was revealed that considerable broadening of maternal base was observed in recently developed genotypes. W/alpha type cytoplasm was present in most of processing (all 3 chipping varieties and 9 of 12 MP hybrids) and late blight resistant (11of 23 hybrids) genotypes.	2008	10.1007/s10681-007-9563-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Cho, Kwang-Soo; Cheon, Kyeong-Sik; Hong, Su-Young; Cho, Ji-Hong; Im, Ju-Seong; Mekapogu, Manjulatha; Yu, Yei-Soo; Park, Tae-Ho	Complete chloroplast genome sequences of Solanum commersonii and its application to chloroplast genotype in somatic hybrids with Solanum tuberosum	PLANT CELL REPORTS	Chloroplast genome of Solanum commersonii and S olanum tuberosum were completely sequenced, and Indel markers were successfully applied to distinguish chlorotypes demonstrating the chloroplast genome was randomly distributed during protoplast fusion. Somatic hybridization has been widely employed for the introgression of resistance to several diseases from wild Solanum species to overcome sexual barriers in potato breeding. Solanum commersonii is a major resource used as a parent line in somatic hybridization to improve bacterial wilt resistance in interspecies transfer to cultivated potato (S. tuberosum). Here, we sequenced the complete chloroplast genomes of Lz3.2 (S. commersonii) and S. tuberosum (PT56), which were used to develop fusion products, then compared them with those of five members of the Solanaceae family, S. tuberosum, Capsicum annum, S. lycopersicum, S. bulbocastanum and S. nigrum and Coffea arabica as an out-group. We then developed Indel markers for application in chloroplast genotyping. The complete chloroplast genome of Lz3.2 is composed of 155,525 bp, which is larger than the PT56 genome with 155,296 bp. Gene content, order and orientation of the S. commersonii chloroplast genome were highly conserved with those of other Solanaceae species, and the phylogenetic tree revealed that S. commersonii is located within the same node of S. tuberosum. However, sequence alignment revealed nine Indels between S. commersonii and S. tuberosum in their chloroplast genomes, allowing two Indel markers to be developed. The markers could distinguish the two species and were successfully applied to chloroplast genotyping (chlorotype) in somatic hybrids and their progenies. The results obtained in this study confirmed the random distribution of the chloroplast genome during protoplast fusion and its maternal inheritance and can be applied to select proper plastid genotypes in potato breeding program.	2016	10.1007/s00299-016-2022-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

The complete chloroplast genome of S. commersonii was constituted by de novo assembly using a small amount of whole genome sequencing data. The chloroplast genome of S. commersonii was 155 525 bp in length, consisted of 86 013 bp of large single copy, 18 366 bp of small single copy region and 25 573 bp of a pair of inverted repeats. A total of 113 genes were annotated including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes and four rRNA genes. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis with 14 Solanaceae species revealed that S. commersonii is much closely related to Solanum tuberosum and S. bulbocastanum.	2016	10.1080/23802359.2016.1156492		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Choudhary, B. R.; Joshi, P.	Cytomorphology of Brassica juncea x B. napus Hybrids and Pattern of Variation in the F-2 Derivatives	CYTOLOGIA	Interspecific hybridization is an important tool to elucidate intergenomic relationships, transfer characters across species, create genetic variability, and to develop synthetic amphidiploids. It has been widely used for improving Brassica. The present study was conducted to find out the crossability between Brassica juncea (AABB, 2n=36) and B. napus (AACC, 2n=38), analyze chromosome association in the F, hybrids, and to estimate variability in F-2 progenies of the cross. The crossability between B. juncea and B. napus was higher when B. juncea was used as the female parent. The hybrids, in general, were vigorous and intermediate in morphological attributes. The meiotic studies of F, plants of cross B. junceaxB. napus (AABC, 2n=37) exhibited 10 bivalents in the majority of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) analyzed. A maximum of 14 bivalents in AABC hybrids and the presence of multivalent associations were attributed to the auto- and allosyndetic nature of pairing within and between the B and C genomes. In the F-2 generation, a high percentage of plants resembling B. juncea type and transgressive segregation for many characters were found.	2013	10.1508/cytologia.78.261		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

After hand-pollination, 906 interspecific F-1 Allium cepa x A. roylei plants were obtained by in vitro culture via embryo rescue. Nuclear DNA analysis showed that 97.6% of the regenerants were interspecific F-1 Allium cepa x A. roylei hybrids.

Chung, Gyuhwa; Singh, Ram J.	Broadening the genetic base of soybean: A multidisciplinary approach	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES	Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is an economically important legume with 2n = 40 chromosomes, whose seeds contain an average of 40% protein and 20% oil, and its plants enrich the soil by fixing nitrogen in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. World soybean production has doubled in the past twenty years to over 220 million metric tons in 2006; the producing countries are U. S. A., Brazil, Argentina, China, and India. Soybean was domesticated in East Asia from its wild annual progenitor G. soja Sieb. & Zucc. (2n= 40). There are 26 wild perennial species, indigenous to Australia, of the subgenus Glycine but a common progenitor with 2n = 20 chromosomes has not been identified, and it may be extinct. It has been demonstrated that Glycine species are of either of alloor auto-tetraploid origin. The cytogenetic knowledge of soybean lags far behind that of other model important crops (rice, maize, wheat, tomato), because it's somatic chromosomes are symmetrical, and only one pair of satellite chromosomes can be identified. Pachytene chromosome analysis created a chromosome map that has laid the foundation for producing primary trisomics. Several molecular linkage maps have been developed, but only 11 of the 20 molecular linkage groups (MLGs) have been associated with specific chromosomes. The genetic base of modern soybean cultivars is narrow and soybean breeders are confined to crossing within the primary gene pool (GP-1). Soybean does not have secondary gene pool (GP-2). Exploitation of the tertiary and quaternary gene pools (GP-3, GP-4) has been attempted but ended at the amphidiploid stage. A methodology for producing fertile lines derived from G. max and G. tomentella (2n = 78) cross has been developed, thereby making introgression of useful genes from GP-3. Genetic transformation has produced Roundup Ready (R) Soybeans, resistant to glyphosate herbicide.	2008	10.1080/07352680802333904		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev/manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Chung, Mi-Young; Chung, Jae-Dong; Ramanna, Munikote; van Tuyl, Jaap M.; Lim, Ki-Byung	Production of Polyploids and Unreduced Gametes in Lilium auratum x L. henryi Hybrid	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Intergenomic F-1 hybrids between L. auratum x L. henryi and their BC1 progeny were investigated through genomic in situ hybridization technique (GISH) to determine their potential value in lily breeding. We confirmed that F-1 intergenomic hybrids possessed a set of chromosomes (x=12) from both parents and that flowers of the F-1 auratum x henryi hybrid showed an intermediate morphological phenotype. Pollen size, viability and germination ability were measured through microscopic observations. F-1 intergenomic hybrids produced a relevant frequency of 2n-gametes, which were successfully used to perform crosses with Oriental hybrids, resulting in the triploid Oriental Auratum Henryi (OAuH) hybrid. Twenty BC1 plants were generated by crossing between four different Oriental hybrid cultivars and F-1 AuH hybrids using an in vitro embryo rescue technique, after which the genome constitution and chromosome composition were analyzed by GISH. All plants were triploid, showing 12 from female parents (diploid Oriental hybrid) and 24 from male parents (diploid F-1 AuH hybrid). Overall, 16 out of 20 BC1 progeny possessed recombinant chromosomes with 1-5 crossover sites per plant. Cytological analysis of 20 BC1 plants by GISH verified that the occurrence of 2n pollen formation in all F-1 AuH hybrids was derived from the FDR (first division restitution) mechanism, in which the genome composition of all BC1 plants possess 12 Oriental + 12 L. auratum + 12 L. henryi chromosomes. Allotriploids derived from the AuH hybrid were used as female for crossing with the diploid Oriental hybrid cultivar 'Sorbonne' and considerable numbers of plants (0-6.5 plants per ovary) were only obtained when female OAuH (BC1) triploids were used. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that production and analysis of F-1 AuH hybrids and their progeny through sexual polyploidization can be useful for efficient creation of important horticultural traits.	2013	10.7150/ijbs.6427		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Cifuentes, Marta; Benavente, Elena	Wheat-alien metaphase I pairing of individual wheat genomes and D genome chromosomes in interspecific hybrids between Triticum aestivum L. and Aegilops geniculata Roth	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Homoeologous metaphase I (MI) pairing of Triticum aestivum x Aegilops geniculata hybrids (2n = 5x = 35, ABDU(g)M(g)) has been examined by an in situ hybridization procedure permitting simultaneous discrimination of A, B, D and wild genomes. The seven D genome chromosomes (and their arms, except for 6D and 7D) plus some additional wheat chromosomes were also identified. Wheat-wild MI associations represented more than 60% of total, with an average ratio of 5:1:12 for those involving the A, B and D genomes, respectively. A remarkable between-chromosome variation for the level of wheat-wild genetic exchange is expected within each wheat genome. However, it can be concluded that 3DL and 5DL are the crop genome locations with the highest probability of being transferred to Ae. geniculata. Hybrids derived from the ph2b wheat mutant line showed increased MI pairing but identical pattern of homoeologous associations than those with active Ph2.	2009	10.1007/s00122-009-1090-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Cimmaruta, Roberta; Forti, Gianluca; Lucente, Daniela; Nascetti, Giuseppe	Thirty years of artificial syntopy between Hydromantes italicus and H. ambrosii ambrosii (Amphibia, Plethodontidae)	AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA	Thirty years ago, in 1983, an experiment of artificial syntopy put together two allopatric taxa of mainland European plethodontids: Hydromantes ambrosii ambrosii and H. italicus. An equal number of specimens of both species were released in a cave with a suitable environment but located outside the range of the genus. The aim was to test the effectiveness of the reproductive isolating mechanisms of these two moderately divergent taxa and, in the case hybridization would have occurred, to analyse the extent and mechanisms of introgressive hybridization while in progress. Previous data collected between 1996 and 1999 showed that H. italicus and H. a. ambrosii were hybridizing and that their hybrids were viable and fertile enough to produce backcrosses. The data presented here, based on allozymes and restriction enzymes on a fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome-b gene, showed that introgressive hybridization is still ongoing. However, the gene exchange between the two taxa is restricted since most of the specimens scored were pure H. a. ambrosii, the percentage of hybrid/recombinant specimens was quite low and a strong deficiency of heterozygote genotypes was recorded. The results presented showed that this long term experiment assisted in providing insights into the patterns and mechanisms underlying hybridization and introgression, showing the spreading of a foreign mtDNA (H. italicus) into the gene pool of another species (H. a. ambrosii) despite the fact that the nuclear genomes remain substantially differentiated.	2013	10.1163/15685381-00002906		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Cisneros, Aroldo; Tel-Zur, Noemi	Genomic analysis in three Hylocereus species and their progeny: evidence for introgressive hybridization and gene flow	EUPHYTICA	Interest in vine cacti of the genus Hylocereus (Cactaceae) has grown markedly due to their high economic potential as exotic fruit crops. Thus, we investigate the genomic and genetic characteristics of 18 accessions belonging to three Hylocereus species, from which were produced eight progeny from self-pollination and 51 interspecific-homoploid and -interploid hybrids. We reported ploidy estimation, allele frequencies, polymorphic information content (PIC) and genetic relationships observed among the Hylocereus species and their progeny. The progeny were diploid, triploid, tetraploid, pentaploid, or hexaploid. Each primer combination used in this work amplified different sets of restriction fragments ranging from 74 to 102 bands. Among the total number of bands observed for the Hylocereus accessions and their progeny, 97.5 and 98.1 %, respectively, were polymorphic. The variability of PIC between primers, species and hybrids suggested high heterozygosity and gene flow between them. In addition, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to successfully identify one of the H. megalanthus accessions beforehand as the unknown male progenitor of the allotriploid S-75. AFLP markers demonstrate the efficacy for assessing genetic relationships and introgression; and provide strong support for the pursuit of additional breeding programs of these fruit crop.	2013	10.1007/s10681-013-0979-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Colombo, Noemi; Carlos Hagiwara, Juan	PCR identification of Petunia male sterile cytoplasm	ORNAMENTAL HORTICULTURE-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE HORTICULTURA ORNAMENTAL	Petunia is a very important ornamental plant with a broad range of flower colour and size, and most of the cultivars grown are propagated through seeds. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a maternally inherited character determined by mitochondrial genes that results in impaired pollen development. The unique and well characterized male sterile cytoplasm in Petunia is a valuable resource for hybrids production because it prevents self-fertilization of mother plants and ensures the purity of F1s. Introgression of the male sterile cytoplasm in elite lines of Petunia is achieved following a backcross scheme and can be assisted using molecular markers associated to the trait of interest. The objective of this study was to develop a molecular marker to identify the male sterile cytoplasm of Petunia. A PCR-based marker amplifying a region of the mitochondrial CMS-associated urfS only in the male sterile plants was designed. Results showed differential PCR amplification of a approximate to 600 bp product in plants carrying male sterile cytoplasm in four Petunia species and their F1s and BC1 generations. A multiplex PCR reaction was subsequently set up, adding specific primers amplifying a approximate to 800 bp product from the conserved region trnT-trn-L of the chloroplast genome as a positive control in order to unambiguously identify the cytoplasm types as normal or sterile. A rapid, simple and precise molecular marker is now available for assisting breeding of F1 hybrids in Petunia.	2019	10.1590/2447-536X.v25i4.2069		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines/manipulated crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Colova-Tsolova, V; Lu, J; Perl, A	Genetically customized seedless grapes for fresh market industry	Proceedings of the Seventh International Symposium on Grapevine Physiology and Biotechnology	The common muscadine grape, Vitis (Muscadinia) rotundifolia Michx., is native to the southeastern United States and has been cultivated for more than 400 years. Although the current production of this species is relatively small, there is tremendous opportunity for commercial growth based on increasing consumer interest in healthier diets and changing lifestyle. The discovery of high levels of antioxidant compounds in muscadine juices and wines has brought more attention to the muscadine grape, not only as an alternative cash value crop for the southeast US, but also as a new health food. Seedless muscadine grapes are likely to become very important for the regional small fruit industry. Due to genetic incongruity and hybrid infertility between muscadine grapes and other cultivars, little progress has been made with the introgression of the seedlessness trait from vinifera grapes into the muscadine grapes using sexual hybridization. In light of these limitations, an efficient strategy to transfer individual traits as single genes into an already available and desirable genetic background, with minimum disturbance to the original genome using DNA recombinant technology is desirable. The implementation and successful commercialization of genetically improved grape cultivars will only be realized if a number of obstacles, both scientific and otherwise can be overcome. Additionally, avoiding the use of antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers may become crucial for the possible release of the genetically modified crop. This study was designed to produce a new generation of genetically tailored seedless muscadine grapes that will provide biosafety guarantees and meet certain legal criteria for field release and commercialization. The gene conferring seedlessness has been transferred into the muscadine cultivar 'Fry' and 17 independent transgenic clones are under greenhouse evaluation. The most important outcomes of this research were: the genetic transformation of muscadine grape was accomplished and the feasibility of a gene transfer approach for genetic improvement of muscadine grape has been proven.	2005	10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.689.58		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Colton, LM; Groza, HI; Wielgus, SM; Jiang, JM	Marker-assisted selection for the broad-spectrum potato late blight resistance conferred by gene RB derived from a wild potato species	CROP SCIENCE	Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, is one of the most damaging diseases in any crop. Deployment of resistant varieties is the most effective way to control this disease. However, breeding for late blight resistance has been a challenge because the race-specific resistance genes introgressed from wild potato S. demissum Lindl. have been short lived and breeding for '' horizontal '' or durable resistance has achieved only moderate successes. We previously demonstrated that the high-level late blight resistance in a wild potato relative, S. butbocastanum Dunal subsp. bulbocastanum, is mainly controlled by a single resistance gene RB. Transgenic potato lines containing the RB gene have showed strong late blight resistance, comparable to the backcrossed progenies derived from the somatic hybrids between potato and S. bulbocastanum. Here we report the development of a polymerase chain reaction-based DNA marker for tracking the RB gene in breeding populations derived from the potato X S. bulbocastanum somatic hybrids. Several marker-positive breeding lines showed the expected late blight resistance in greenhouse evaluations. Our results demonstrate that marker-based selection will allow us to effectively transfer the RB gene into potato using traditional breeding methods, an alternative to deploying the RB gene through genetic transformation.	2006	10.2135/cropsci2005.0112		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Corbi, Jonathan; Baack, Eric J.; Dechaine, Jennifer M.; Seiler, Gerald; Burke, John M.	Genome-wide analysis of allele frequency change in sunflower crop-wild hybrid populations evolving under natural conditions	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Crop-wild hybridization occurs in numerous plant species and could alter the genetic structure and evolutionary dynamics of wild populations. Studying crop-derived alleles in wild populations is also relevant to assessing/mitigating the risks associated with transgene escape. To date, crop-wild hybridization has generally been examined via short-term studies, typically within a single generation, focusing on few traits or genetic markers. Little is known about patterns of selection on crop-derived alleles over multiple generations, particularly at a genome-wide scale. Here, we documented patterns of natural selection in an experimental cropxwild sunflower population that was allowed to evolve under natural conditions for two generations at two locations. Allele frequencies at a genome-wide collection of SNPs were tracked across generations, and a common garden experiment was conducted to compare trait means between generations. These data allowed us to identify instances of selection on crop-derived alleles/traits and, in concert with QTL mapping results, test for congruence between our genotypic and phenotypic results. We found that natural selection overwhelmingly favours wild alleles and phenotypes. However, crop alleles in certain genomic regions can be favoured, and these changes often occurred in parallel across locations. We did not, however, consistently observe close agreement between our genotypic and phenotypic results. For example, when a trait evolved towards the wild phenotype, wild QTL alleles associated with that trait did not consistently increase in frequency. We discuss these results in the context of crop allele introgression into wild populations and implications for the management of GM crops.	2018	10.1111/mec.14202		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	experimental hybrids	FALSE			FALSE	
Costanzo, S; Simko, I; Christ, BJ; Haynes, KG	QTL analysis of late blight resistance in a diploid potato family of Solanum phureja x S-stenotomum	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Field resistance to Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, the causal agent of late blight in potatoes, has been characterized in a potato segregating family of 230 full-sib progenies derived from a cross between two hybrid Solanum phureja x S. stenotomum clones. The distribution of area under the disease progress curve values, measured in different years and locations, was consistent with the inheritance of multigenic resistance. Relatively high levels of resistance and transgressive segregations were also observed within this family. A genetic linkage map of this population was constructed with the intent of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with this late blight field resistance. A total of 132 clones from this family were genotyped based on 162 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. The genome coverage by the map (855.2 cM) is estimated to be at least 70% and includes 112 segregating RFLP markers and two phenotypic markers, with an average distance of 7.7 cM between two markers. Two methods were employed to determine trait-marker association, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and interval mapping analysis. Three major QTLs were detected on linkage group III, V, and XI, explaining 23, 17, and 10%, respectively, of the total phenotypic variation. The present study revealed the presence of potentially new genetic loci in this diploid potato family contributing to general resistance against late blight. The identification of these QTLs represents the first step toward their introgression into cultivated tetraploid potato cultivars through marker-assisted selection.	2005	10.1007/s00122-005-2053-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Cox, Thomas S.; Wu, Jizhong; Wang, Shuwen; Cai, Jin; Zhong, Qiaofeng; Fu, Bisheng	Comparing two approaches for introgression of germplasm from Aegilops tauschii into common wheat	CROP JOURNAL	Allelic diversity in the wild grass Aegilops tauschii is vastly greater than that in the D genome of common wheat (Triticum aestivum), of which Ae. tauschii is the source. Since the 1980s, there have been numerous efforts to harness a much larger share of Ae. tauschii's extensive and highly variable gene pool for wheat improvement. Those efforts have followed two distinct approaches: production of amphiploids, known as "synthetic hexaploids," between T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii, and direct hybridization between T. aestivum and Ae. tauschii; both approaches then involve backcrossing to T. aestivum. Both synthetic hexaploid production and direct hybridization have led to the transfer of numerous new genes into common wheat that confer improvements in many traits. This work has led to release of improved cultivars in China, the United States, and many other countries. Each approach to D-genome improvement has advantages and disadvantages. For example, production of synthetic hexaploids can incorporate useful germplasm from both T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii, thereby enhancing the A, B, and D genomes; on the other hand, direct hybridization rapidly restores the recurrent parent's A and B genomes and avoids incorporation of genes with adverse effects on threshability, hybrid necrosis, vernalization response, milling and baking quality, and other traits, which are often transferred when T. turgidum is used as a parent. Choice of method will depend in part on the type of wheat being developed and the target environment. However, more extensive use of the so-far underexploited direct hybridization approach is especially warranted. (C) 2017 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Cremona, Gaetana; Iovene, Marina; Festa, Giovanna; Conicella, Clara; Parisi, Mario	Production of embryo rescued hybrids between the landrace "Friariello" (Capsicum annuum var. annuum) and C-baccatum var. pendulum: phenotypic and cytological characterization	EUPHYTICA	Capsicum baccatum var. pendulum is a valuable source of disease resistance and fruit quality traits that could play an important role in the genetic improvement and safeguard of local varieties of common peppers. However, its use for C. annuum var. annuum breeding has been scarce due to postzygotic incompatibilities. In this work, we obtained seven interspecific hybrids between the Italian landrace 'Friariello' of C. annuum var. annuum and C. baccatum var. pendulum through embryo rescue. The F1 hybrids were verified by SSR markers and by in situ hybridization, which confirmed their hybrid status and provided evidence for differences in the repetitive content between the parental genomes. These hybrids were vigorous and, for several morphological traits, were intermediate between their parents. However, they were male sterile. The cytological analysis revealed several abnormalities occurring at various stages of the male meiosis. A number of these anomalies were likely the result of structural differences (e.g. a reciprocal translocation, a paracentric inversion) between the two genomes. Due to hybrid pollen sterility, backcross progenies (BC1) were obtained when hybrids were used as female parents. A partial restoration of the fertility in BC1 makes promising the exploitation of this material in breeding programs.	2018	10.1007/s10681-018-2211-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Cristina Acosta, M.; Premoli, Andrea C.	Understanding the extensive hybridization in South American Nothofagus through karyotype analysis	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	Extensive phylogeographic and population studies in Nothofagus revealed that hybridization, introgression and plastid capture are common phenomena that have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of the genus. Here, detailed karyotypes of ten South American Nothofagus spp. were constructed using chromosome fluorescent banding with the aim of (1) investigating if karyotype features were compatible with the formation of fertile interspecific hybrids, particularly when growing in sympatry and (2) identifying species-specific chromosomal markers to enable further studies of hybridization in Nothofagus. Similar karyotype formulas and heterochromatin patterns among species of the same Glade (i.e. subgenus) revealed a low rate of chromosomal change. This finding reinforces the idea that hybrids between Nothofagus spp. can be fertile and that chromosome pairing in meioses could be successful. Genome conservation and extensive hybridization that resulted in plastid capture has been observed in other woody genera. Hybridization in tree species could be a survival strategy to enable the successful colonization of sites after disturbance and the introgression of genes from their congeners (adaptive introgression) may play an important role in adapting to climate change. Finally, N antarctica has one more nucleolus organizing region (NOR) than its congeners that is easily identifiable and therefore could be used in future studies of hybrids.	2018	10.1093/botlinnean/boy043		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytological study; abstract reports evidence for introgression, so might be worth a citation hunt	FALSE			FALSE	
Crystal, Philip A.; Lichti, Nathanael I.; Woeste, Keith E.; Jacobs, Douglass F.	Vegetative and Adaptive Traits Predict Different Outcomes for Restoration Using Hybrids	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Hybridization has been implicated as a driver of speciation, extinction, and invasiveness, but can also provide resistant breeding stock following epidemics. However, evaluating the appropriateness of hybrids for use in restoration programs is difficult. Past the F1 generation, the proportion of a progenitor's genome can vary widely, as can the combinations of parental genomes. Detailed genetic analysis can reveal this information, but cannot expose phenotypic alterations due to heterosis, transgressive traits, or changes in metabolism or development. In addition, because evolution is often driven by extreme individuals, decisions based on phenotypic averages of hybrid classes may have unintended results. We demonstrate a strategy to evaluate hybrids for use in restoration by visualizing hybrid phenotypes across selected groups of traits relative to both progenitor species. Specifically, we used discriminant analysis to differentiate among butternut (Juglans cinerea L.), black walnut (J. nigra L.), and Japanese walnut (J. ailantifolia Carr. var. cordiformis) using vegetative characters and then with functional adaptive traits associated with seedling performance. When projected onto the progenitor trait space, naturally occurring hybrids (J. x bixbyi Rehd.) between butternut and Japanese walnut showed introgression toward Japanese walnut at vegetative characters but exhibited a hybrid swarm at functional traits. Both results indicate that hybrids have morphological and ecological phenotypes that distinguish them from butternut, demonstrating a lack of ecological equivalency that should not be carried into restoration breeding efforts. Despite these discrepancies, some hybrids were projected into the space occupied by butternut seedlings' 95% confidence ellipse, signifying that some hybrids were similar at the measured traits. Determining how to consistently identify these individuals is imperative for future breeding and species restoration efforts involving hybrids. Discriminant analysis provides a useful technique to visualize past selection mechanisms and current variation in hybrid populations, especially when key ecological traits that distinguish progenitors are unknown. Furthermore, discriminant analysis affords a tool to assess ecological equivalency of hybrid populations and breeding program efforts to select for certain traits and monitor the amount of variability of those traits, relative to progenitors.	2016	10.3389/fpls.2016.01741		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Cseh, Andras; Megyeri, Maria; Yang, Caiyun; Hubbart-Edwards, Stella; Scholefield, Duncan; Ashling, Stephen S.; King, Ian P.; King, Julie; Grewal, Surbhi	Development of a New A(m)-Genome-Specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Marker Set for the Molecular Characterization of Wheat-Triticum monococcum Introgression Lines	PLANT GENOME	Cultivated einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L. subsp. monococcum, 2n = 2x = 14, A(m)A(m)) and its wild relative T. monococcum subsp. aegilopoides are important sources of economically useful genes that can be exploited for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding. Einkorn has excellent resistance to fungal diseases and gene transfer is relatively simple via standard breeding methods. To fulfill the growing demand by modern prebreeding programs for a cost-effective high-throughput procedure for accurately detecting introgressed chromosomes or chromosome segments from T. monococcum into wheat, we used the Axiom Wheat-Relative Genotyping Array and developed a set of A(m) genome-specific exome-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers suitable for rapid identification of T. monococcum chromatin in a wheat background. We identified 1247 polymorphic SNPs between T. monococcum and wheat. We identified 191 markers across all seven chromosomes of T. monococcum that are also present on an existing Triticum urartu Thum. ex Gandil. genetic map and potentially ordered them on the basis of the high macrocollinearity and conservation of marker order between T. monococcum and T. urartu. The marker set has been tested on leaf-rust-resistant BC3F4 progenies of wheat-T. monococcum hybrids. Two markers (AX-94492165, AX-95073542) placed on the distal end of the chromosome arm 7AL detected a T. monococcum introgression into wheat. The SNP marker set thus proved highly effective in the identification of T. monococcum chromatin in a wheat background, offering a reliable method for screening and selecting wheat-T. monococcum introgression lines, a procedure that could significantly speed up prebreeding programs.	2019	10.3835/plantgenome2018.12.0098		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Cui, Haifeng; Sun, Yang; Deng, Jingyao; Wang, Minqin; Xia, Guangmin	Chromosome elimination and introgression following somatic hybridization between bread wheat and other grass species	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE	The timing and influencing factor of donor chromosome elimination and introgression in somatic hybrids involving bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated by sampling fusion products made between bread wheat and four different donor species. Genomic in situ hybridization experiments showed that both events in the main occurred within 12-15 days of the fusion. Over 70 % of the elimination events had taken place before the first mitotic interphase. Pre-treating the donor protoplasts by either gamma or UV irradiation showed that the severity of exposure affected the likelihood of chromosome elimination and introgression. More donor chromosome elimination and less introgression occurred when donors were phylogenetically more distant, such as annual meadow grass (Poaannua) or maize (Zea mays), than phylogenetically closer donors such as tall wheatgrass [Agropyron elongatum (Thinopyrum elongatum)] or Haynaldia villosa. The interaction effect between donor species and irradiation time significantly affected the chromatin behaviors during somatic hybridization. Besides, the polyploid A. elongatum behaved differently from diploid H. villosa, even though these two species are phylogenetically equidistant from wheat.	2015	10.1007/s11240-014-0594-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Cui, Haifeng; Yu, Zhiyong; Deng, Jingyao; Gao, Xin; Sun, Yang; Xia, Guangmin	Introgression of bread wheat chromatin into tall wheatgrass via somatic hybridization	PLANTA	Regenerates were obtained following somatic hybridization between tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Jinan177) protoplasts. Two lines (CU and XI) were self-fertile in the first (R-0) and subsequent (R-1 and R-2) generations. The phenotype of each R-1 population was uniform. All CU progeny were phenotypically similar to the tall wheatgrass parent, while XI progeny had thinner, smoother and softer leaves. Cytological analysis showed that more wheat chromatin was present in the hybrid callus than in the R-1 and R-2 plants, and that some intercalary translocations of wheat chromosome segments were retained in the R-2 generation. AFLP profiling confirmed the presence of wheat DNA in the introgression lines. Analysis of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit content of derived seed identified three novel subunits, not present in either the wheat or the tall wheatgrass parent. Microsatellite-based profiling of the chloroplast genome of the introgression lines suggested that only chloroplast sequences from the tall wheatgrass parent were present. The specifically inherited phenomena and possible application of these hybrids are discussed.	2009	10.1007/s00425-008-0832-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Such reticulate evolution coupled with vegetative propagation results in genomes that are mosaics of large chromosome fragments of the basic taxa, in frequent interspecific heterozygosity. Breeding of these species is hampered by their complex heterozygous genomic structures. Haplotyping of multiple gene fragments along the genome should be a powerful approach to resolve the evolutionary history of the gene pools, to reveal the admixture genomic structure of current species and to develop innovative breeding schemes. We have analysed the efficiency of parallel sequencing with 454 methodology to decipher the hybrid structure of modern citrus species and cultivars along chromosome 2. Four hundred fifty four amplicon libraries were established with the fluidigm array system for 48 genotypes and 16 gene fragments of chromosome 2. Haplotypes were established from the reads of each accession and phylogenetic analyses were performed from the haplotypic data of each gene fragment. The length of 454 reads and the level of differentiation between the ancestral taxa of modern citrus allowed efficient haplotype phylogenetic assignations for 12 of the 16 gene fragments. The analysis of the mixed genomic structure of modern species and cultivars (i) revealed C. maxima introgressions in modern mandarins; (ii) was consistent with previous hypothesis regarding the origin of secondary species; and (iii) provided a new picture of the evolution of chromosome 2. Perspectives to rebuild the main secondary species from the basic taxa are discussed.	2015			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	abstract for a conference	FALSE			FALSE	
Curk, Franck; Ancillo, Gema; Garcia-Lor, Andres; Luro, Francois; Perrier, Xavier; Jacquemoud-Collet, Jean-Pierre; Navarro, Luis; Ollitrault, Patrick	Next generation haplotyping to decipher nuclear genomic interspecific admixture in Citrus species: analysis of chromosome 2	BMC GENETICS	Background: The most economically important Citrus species originated by natural interspecific hybridization between four ancestral taxa (Citrus reticulata, Citrus maxima, Citrus medica, and Citrus micrantha) and from limited subsequent interspecific recombination as a result of apomixis and vegetative propagation. Such reticulate evolution coupled with vegetative propagation results in mosaic genomes with large chromosome fragments from the basic taxa in frequent interspecific heterozygosity. Modern breeding of these species is hampered by their complex heterozygous genomic structures that determine species phenotype and are broken by sexual hybridisation. Nevertheless, a large amount of diversity is present in the citrus gene pool, and breeding to allow inclusion of desirable traits is of paramount importance. However, the efficient mobilization of citrus biodiversity in innovative breeding schemes requires previous understanding of Citrus origins and genomic structures. Haplotyping of multiple gene fragments along the whole genome is a powerful approach to reveal the admixture genomic structure of current species and to resolve the evolutionary history of the gene pools. In this study, the efficiency of parallel sequencing with 454 methodology to decipher the hybrid structure of modern citrus species was assessed by analysis of 16 gene fragments on chromosome 2. Results: 454 amplicon libraries were established using the Fluidigm array system for 48 genotypes and 16 gene fragments from chromosome 2. Haplotypes were established from the reads of each accession and phylogenetic analyses were performed using the haplotypic data for each gene fragment. The length of 454 reads and the level of differentiation between the ancestral taxa of modern citrus allowed efficient haplotype phylogenetic assignations for 12 of the 16 gene fragments. The analysis of the mixed genomic structure of modern species and cultivars (i) revealed C. maxima introgressions in modern mandarins, (ii) was consistent with previous hypotheses regarding the origin of secondary species, and (iii) provided a new picture of the evolution of chromosome 2. Conclusions: 454 sequencing was an efficient strategy to establish haplotypes with significant phylogenetic assignations in Citrus, providing a new picture of the mixed structure on chromosome 2 in 48 citrus genotypes.	2014	10.1186/s12863-014-0152-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	genome structure analysis	FALSE			FALSE	
D'Hont, A	Unraveling the genome structure of polyploids using FISH and GISH; examples of sugarcane and banana	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	We review here the progress that has been achieved using molecular cytogenetics to analyze the genome structure of sugarcane (Saccharum spp) and banana (Musa spp), two crops that are polyploid, of interspecific origin and with chromosomes not distinguishable by their gross morphology. In Saccharum, molecular cytogenetics enabled us to determine the basic chromosome number of two species, Saccharum officinarum and S. spontaneum, involved in the origin of modern cultivars, to quantify the proportion of chromosomes of these species in the genome of modern cultivars, to assess the extent of interspecific chromosome recombination and to clarify the origin of the related species S. barberi. These techniques are also used to monitor introgression with related genera. In Musa, GISH enabled us to differentiate the four genomes involved in banana cultivars and allowed us to determine the genome constitution of several cultivars. FISH was used to analyze the distribution of repeated sequences along the genome. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.	2005	10.1159/000082378		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Dai, Liang-Fang; Chen, Ya-Ling; Luo, Xiang-Dong; Wen, Xiu-Fang; Cui, Feng-Lei; Zhang, Fan-Tao; Zhou, Yi; Xie, Jian-Kun	Level and pattern of DNA methylation changes in rice cold tolerance introgression lines derived from Oryza rufipogon Griff.	EUPHYTICA	Cold stress is a significant factor influencing global rice production and quality. In the present study, two strong rice cold tolerance introgression lines (ILs) (IL5335 and IL5243) derived from Oryza sativa L. mating with O. rufipogon Griff. were used to evaluate the relationship between the alteration of DNA methylation and phenotypic stability using methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism. Compared to the recurrent parent, the level of total methylation in IL5243 was slightly increased (30.94 %) and that of IL5335 was significantly decreased (24.17 %). There were 109 (10.35 %) and 56 (5.52 %) loci showed demethylation in IL5335 and IL5243, respectively. And meanwhile, there were 28 loci (2.66 %) in IL5335 and 30 (2.96 %) loci in IL5243 showed hyper-methylation. Analysis of 17 differentially methylated sequences indicated that nine sequences had high similarity to some functional genes (e.g. CHY1, MAPK et al.), and some others were similar to retrotransposon or rice genome sequence. Further analysis indicated that CHY1 and MAPK in IL5335 and IL5243 underwent demethylation process and their expression level tested by RT-qPCR was higher than that of their parents, which suggested that the alteration of methylation modification might influence some genes expression. These results provide useful information for efficiently exploiting and using interesting wild genes for rice enhancement.	2015	10.1007/s10681-015-1389-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Danilova, Tatiana V.; Friebe, Bernd; Gill, Bikram S.; Poland, Jesse; Jackson, Eric	Chromosome Rearrangements Caused by Double Monosomy in Wheat-Barley Group-7 Substitution Lines	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Interspecific or introgressive hybridization is one of the driving forces in plant speciation, producing allopolyploids or diploids with rearranged genomes. The process of karyotype reshaping following homoploid interspecific hybridization has not been studied experimentally. Interspecific hybridization is widely used in plant breeding to increase genetic diversity and introgress new traits. Numerous introgression stocks were developed for hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 6x = 42, genome AABBDD). Double monosomic lines, containing one alien chromosome from the tertiary gene pool of wheat and one homoeologous wheat chromosome, represent a simplified model for studying chromosome rearrangements caused by interspecific hybridization. The pairing of a chromosome from the tertiary gene pool with a wheat homoeologue is restricted by the activity of the wheat Ph1 gene, thus, rearrangements caused by chromosome breakage followed by the fusion of the broken arms can be expected. We analyzed chromosome aberrations in 4 sets of lines that originated from double monosomics of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome 7H and wheat group-7 chromosomes with dicentric or ring chromosomes. The dynamics of wheat-barley dicentric chromosomes during plant development was followed and an increased diversity of rearrangements was observed. Besides the targeted group-7 chromosomes, other wheat chromosomes were involved in rearrangements, as chromosomes broken in the centromeric region fused with other broken chromosomes. In some cells, multi-centric chromosomes were observed. The structure and dosage of the introgressed barley chromatin was changed. The transmission of the rearrangements to the progenies was analyzed. The observed aberrations emphasize the importance of cytogenetic screening in gene introgression projects.

De Capdeville, Guy; Souza Junior, Manoel Teixeira; Szinay, Dora; Cardamone Diniz, Leandro Eugenio; Wijnker, Erik; Swennen, Rony; Jan Kema, Gerrit Haatje; De Jong, Hans	The potential of high-resolution BAC-FISH in banana breeding	EUPHYTICA	The genetic complexity in the genus Musa has been subject of study in many breeding programs worldwide. Parthenocarpy, female sterility, polyploidy in different cultivars and limited amount of genetic and genomic information make the production of new banana cultivars difficult and time consuming. In addition, it is known that part of the cultivars and related wild species in the genus contain numerous chromosomal rearrangements. In order to produce new cultivars more effectively breeders must better understand the genetic differences of the potential crossing parents for introgression hybridization, but extensive genetic information is lacking. As an alternative to achieve information on genetic collinearity we make use of modern chromosome map technology known as high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). This article presents the technical aspects and applications of such a technology in Musa species. The technique deals with BAC clone positioning on pachytene chromosomes of Calcutta 4 (Musa acuminata ssp. burmanicoides, A genome group, section Eumusa) and M. velutina (section Rodochlamys). Pollen mother cells digestion with pectolytic enzymes and maceration with acetic acid were optimized for making cell spread preparations appropriate for FISH. As an example of this approach we chose BAC clones that contain markers to known resistance genes and hybridize them for establishing their relative positions on the two species. Technical challenges for adapting existing protocols to the banana cells are presented. We also discuss how this technique can be instrumental for validating collinearity between potential crossing parents and how the method can be helpful in future mapping initiatives, and how this method allows identification of chromosomal rearrangements between related Musa species and cultivars.	2009	10.1007/s10681-008-9830-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
de Maagd, Ruud A.; Loonen, Annelies; Chouaref, Jihed; Pele, Alexandre; Meijer-Dekens, Fien; Fransz, Paul; Bai, Yuling	CRISPR/Cas inactivation of RECQ4 increases homeologous crossovers in an interspecific tomato hybrid	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL	Crossover formation during meiosis in plants is required for proper chromosome segregation and is essential for crop breeding as it allows an (optimal) combination of traits by mixing parental alleles on each chromosome. Crossover formation commences with the production of a large number of DNA double-strand breaks, of which only a few result in crossovers. A small number of genes, which drive the resolution of DNA crossover intermediate structures towards non-crossovers, have been identified in Arabidopisis thaliana. In order to explore the potential of modification of these genes in interspecific hybrids between crops and their wild relatives towards increased production of crossovers, we have used CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis in an interspecific tomato hybrid to knockout RecQ4. A biallelic recq4 mutant was obtained in the F1 hybrid of Solanum lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium. Compared with the wild-type F1 hybrid, the F1 recq4 mutant was shown to have a significant increase in crossovers: a 1.53-fold increase when directly observing ring bivalents in male meiocytes microscopically and a 1.8-fold extension of the genetic map when measured by analysing SNP markers in the progeny (F2) plants. This is one of the first demonstrations of increasing crossover frequency in interspecific hybrids by manipulating genes in crossover intermediate resolution pathways and the first to do so by directed mutagenesis. Significance statement Increasing crossover frequency during meiosis can speed up or simplify crop breeding that relies on meiotic crossovers to introduce favourable alleles controlling important traits from wild relatives into crops. Here we show for the first time that knocking out an inhibitor of crossovers in an interspecific hybrid between tomato and its relative wild species using CRISPR/Cas9-mutagenesis results in increased recombination between the two genomes.	2020	10.1111/pbi.13248		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulated cross	FALSE			FALSE

The whole nuclear genomes of Dasypyrum villosum (Dv) and T. turgidum var durum have been combined, and an homoploid derivative of the original amphiploid displayed typical 'farro' spike morphology, tough rachis and the adaptive traits of Dv such as high resistance to diseases (caused by Tilletia tritici, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Puccinia triticina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici), heading earliness and fortified caryopses (high protein and micronutrient contents). The dissection of the Dv genome by either 'Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring (CS) x hexaploid amphiploid' or '(CS x Dv) x CS' hybridization and backcrossing provided wheat introgression breeding lines (IBLs) expressing one or more of the Dv adaptive traits. Molecular analyses revealed that either cryptic or Genomic In-situ Hybridization (GISH) detectable Dv chromatin introgression occurred in those IBLs. The IBLs, after 2 years of low-input field tests and genetic analyses in Italy and Hungary, showed simple inheritance, dominance and stability of the adaptive and disease resistance traits.	2011	10.1017/S1479262111000141		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
de Paula, Ailton Ferreira; Dinato, Naiana Barbosa; Zanotto Vigna, Bianca Baccili; Favero, Alessandra Pereira	Recombinants from the crosses between amphidiploid and cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) for pest-resistance breeding programs	PLOS ONE	Peanut is a major oilseed crop worldwide. In the Brazilian peanut production, silvering thrips and red necked peanut worm are the most threatening pests. Resistant varieties are considered an alternative to pest control. Many wild diploid Arachis species have shown resistance to these pests, and these can be used in peanut breeding by obtaining hybrid of A and B genomes and subsequent polyploidization with colchicine, resulting in an AABB amphidiploid. This amphidiploid can be crossed with cultivated peanut (AABB) to provide genes of interest to the cultivar. In this study, the sterile diploid hybrids from A. magna V 13751 and A. kempff-mercadoi V 13250 were treated with colchicine for polyploidization, and the amphidiploids were crossed with A. hypogaea cv. IAC OL 4 to initiate the introgression of the wild genes into the cultivated peanut. The confirmation of the hybridity of the progenies was obtained by: (1) reproductive characterization through viability of pollen, (2) molecular characterization using microsatellite markers and (3) morphological characterization using 61 morphological traits with principal component analysis. The diploid hybrid individual was polyploidized, generating the amphidiploid An 13 (A. magna V 13751 x A. kempff-mercadoi V 13250)(4x). Four F-1 hybrid plants were obtained from IAC OL 4 x An 13, and 51 F-2 seeds were obtained from these F-1 plants. Using reproductive, molecular and morphological characterizations, it was possible to distinguish hybrid plants from selfed plants. In the cross between A. hypogaea and the amphidiploid, as the two parents are polyploid, the hybrid progeny and selves had the viability of the pollen grains as high as the parents. This fact turns the use of reproductive characteristics impossible for discriminating, in this case, the hybrid individuals from selfing. The hybrids between A. hypogaea and An 13 will be used in breeding programs seeking pest resistance, being subjected to successive backcrosses until recovering all traits of interest of A. hypogaea, keeping the pest resistance.	2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0175940		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Meiotic behaviour in the first interspecific hybrids between Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria decumbens	PLANT BREEDING	P>Brachiaria brizantha and Brachiaria decumbens constitute the two most widely used tropical forage species for cultivated pastures and support both beef and dairy cattle production in the tropics. Two apomictic cultivars -B. brizantha cv. 'Marandu' and B. decumbens cv. 'Basilisk'- cover more than 100 million hectares of cultivated pastures throughout Latin America and Southeast Asia. This paper discusses the cytogenetic data of the first successful attempt in obtaining interspecific hybrids between these two species. Artificial hybridization between two diploid (2n = 2x = 18) sexual accessions (B. brizantha, B105 x B. decumbens, D004) was performed in the greenhouse. Only three hybrids were recovered. One of them was treated with colchicine in tissue culture and two amphidiploid plants were obtained. Meiosis in the diploid genitors was quite normal, while in the diploid hybrid parental genome separation was observed together with some irregular chromosome segregation. Genome separation was also observed in several cells in the two 4n amphidiploid hybrids. In these, a high number of meiocytes with chromosomes chaotically spread in the cytoplasm was recorded during meiosis. The abnormalities observed compromised the meiotic products characterized by polyads. Chromosomes associated generally as bivalents but some association as quadrivalents in diakinesis in one of the amphidiploid hybrids indicates taxonomic proximity between these two species. Moreover, it indicates that introgression of desirable genes may be feasible between these two most important agronomic species of the genus.	2010	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01674.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Deng, Jingyao; Cui, Haifeng; Zhi, Daying; Zhou, Chuanen; Xia, Guangmin	Analysis of remote asymmetric somatic hybrids between common wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana	PLANT CELL REPORTS	Callus-derived protoplasts of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Hesheng 3) irradiated with ultraviolet light were fused by using the PEG method with cell suspension-derived protoplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. Regenerated calli and green plants resembling that of wheat were obtained. The hybrid nature of putative calli and plants were confirmed by isozyme, random amplified polymorphic DNA and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analyses. GISH results indicated that 1 similar to 3 small chromosome fragments of A. thaliana were found introgression into the terminals of wheat chromosomes, forming highly asymmetric hybrids. Cytoplasmic genome tests did not show any cytoplasmic genetic materials from A. thaliana. However, variations from the normal wheat cytoplasmic genome were found, indicating recombination or rearrangement occurred during the process of somatic hybridization. The chromosome elimination in the asymmetric somatic hybridization of remote phylogenetic relationship was discussed. A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element related sequence was found by chance in the hybrids which might accompany and impact the process of somatic hybridization.	2007	10.1007/s00299-007-0345-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Desta, Zeratsion Abera; de Koning, Dirk-Jan; Ortiz, Rodomiro	Molecular mapping and identification of quantitative trait loci for domestication traits in the field cress (Lepidium campestre L.) genome	HEREDITY	Lepidium campestre (L.) or field cress is a multifaceted oilseed plant, which is not yet domesticated. Moreover, the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the domestication traits of field cress remain largely elusive. The overarching goal of this study is to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are fundamental for domestication of field cress. Mapping and dissecting quantitative trait variation may provide important insights into genomic trajectories underlying field cress domestication. We used 7624 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for QTL mapping in 428 F-2 interspecific hybrid individuals, while field phenotyping was conducted in F-2:3 segregating families. We applied multiple QTL mapping algorithms to detect and estimate the QTL effects for seven important domestication traits of field cress. Verification of pod shattering across sites revealed that the non-shattering lines declined drastically whereas the shattering lines increased sharply, possibly due to inbreeding followed by selection events. In total, 1461 of the 7624 SNP loci were mapped to eight linkage groups (LGs), spanning 571.9 cM map length. We identified 27 QTL across all LGs of field cress genome, which captured medium to high heritability, implying that genomics-assisted selection could deliver domesticated lines in field cress breeding. The use of high throughput genotyping can accelerate the process of domestication in novel crop species. This is the first QTL mapping analysis in the field cress genome that may lay a foundational framework for positional or functional QTL cloning, introgression as well as genomics-assisted breeding in field cress domestication.	2020	10.1038/s41437-020-0296-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	synthetic crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Amylopectin is used as an ingredient in textile, adhesive and paper industries. Further, waxy green cob is popular as breakfast item in South Asia and an important constituent of diet in north-eastern states of India as well. We developed a series of waxy inbreds from diverse exotic sources and through introgression breeding. To characterize and unravel the genetic relationships, 24 diverse waxy inbreds were analysed using 77 SSRs distributed throughout the genome. The study generated a total of 203 polymorphic alleles, with a mean of 2.69 alleles per locus. A total of nine unique and 20 rare alleles were detected. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.08 to 0.68 with an average value of 0.40. Molecular profiling suggested sufficient attainment of homozygosity among the inbreds. Jaccard's dissimilarity coefficient between pairs of genotypes varied from 0.26 to 0.83 which revealed the diverse nature of the inbred lines. Cluster analyses grouped 24 genotypes into three major clusters. Principle coordinate analysis based on SSR also depicted the diverse origin of the genotypes as per the pedigree more reliably than agromorphological traits. These inbreds were also promising for various cob and grain characteristics including grain yield. The study identified a set of potential cross-combinations that can be planned to develop highly heterotic waxy hybrid combinations. This is the first report of development and characterization of waxy inbreds in India.	2017	10.1007/s13205-017-0946-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Devi, Urmila; Grewal, Surbhi; Yang, Cai-yun; Hubbart-Edwards, Stella; Scholefield, Duncan; Ashling, Stephen; Burridge, Amanda; King, Ian P.; King, Julie	Development and characterisation of interspecific hybrid lines with genome-wide introgressions from Triticum timopheevii in a hexaploid wheat background	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	BackgroundTriticum timopheevii (2n=4x=28; A(t)A(t)GG), is an important source for new genetic variation for wheat improvement with genes for potential disease resistance and salt tolerance. By generating a range of interspecific hybrid lines, T. timopheevii can contribute to wheat's narrow gene-pool and be practically utilised in wheat breeding programmes. Previous studies that have generated such introgression lines between wheat and its wild relatives have been unable to use high-throughput methods to detect the presence of wild relative segments in such lines.ResultsA whole genome introgression approach, exploiting homoeologous recombination in the absence of the Ph1 locus, has resulted in the transfer of different chromosome segments from both the A(t) and G genomes of T. timopheevii into wheat. These introgressions have been detected and characterised using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers present on a high-throughput Axiom (R) Genotyping Array. The analysis of these interspecific hybrid lines has resulted in the detection of 276 putative unique introgressions from T. timopheevii, thereby allowing the generation of a genetic map of T. timopheevii containing 1582 SNP markers, spread across 14 linkage groups representing each of the seven chromosomes of the A(t) and G genomes of T. timopheevii. The genotyping of the hybrid lines was validated through fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Comparative analysis of the genetic map of T. timopheevii and the physical map of the hexaploid wheat genome showed that synteny between the two species is highly conserved at the macro-level and confirmed the presence of inter- and intra-genomic translocations within the A(t) and G genomes of T. timopheevii that have been previously only detected through cytological techniques.ConclusionsIn this work, we report a set of SNP markers present on a high-throughput genotyping array, able to detect the presence of T. timopheevii in a hexaploid wheat background making it a potentially valuable tool for marker assisted selection (MAS) in wheat pre-breeding programs. These valuable resources of high-density molecular markers and wheat-T. timopheevii hybrid lines will greatly enhance the work being undertaken for wheat improvement through wild relative introgressions.	2019	10.1186/s12870-019-1785-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Dey, S. S.; Bhatia, R.; Sharma, S. R.; Sharma, Kanika; Parkash, Chander; Kumar, Raj	Population dynamics in introgression of wild male sterile cytoplasm into Brassica oleracea: a small population based breeding modelr	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	Cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines are used widely in vegetable brassicas to develop F-1 hybrids. However, the population dynamics in introgression of male sterile cytoplasm into the nuclear background of B. oleracea is not understood. We have tested 3 models of back crossing using different number of plants for last 12 years. A back cross introgression model using single plant for initial 3 generations and 6 plants thereafter till BC9 was most effective in ensuring uniformity and complete recovery of recurrent parent nuclear genome. The agronomic and floral performance was tested at different stages of back crossing. Inbreeding depression for various traits was highest when single plant was used till BC9 followed by 6 plants from BC4 onwards. Lowest inbreeding depression was recorded in the backcross model based on 12 plants from BC4 onwards. However, when 12 plants were selected from BC4 onwards, there was significant difference among A and B lines for various agronomic traits at BC9 stage. Hybrids were produced using these CMS lines after 2 generation of bulking. Performances of hybrids were at par for the CMS lines developed using 6 plants and 12 plants from BC4 onwards. However, the population developed through single plant selection till BC9 lost its vigor completely and was not able to recover the original characteristics even after 2 generation of bulking. For the first time we report a small population based model for introgression of desirable traits into B. oleracea nuclear background. This model will be immensely useful in introgression of desirable traits in brassica vegetables through backcrossing because of its practical application.	2018	10.1016/j.scienta.2018.01.008		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Dey, S. S.; Sharma, Kanika; Dey, R. Bhatia; Kumar, G. M. Sandeep; Singh, Dinesh; Kumar, Raj; Parkash, Chander	Inter specific hybridization (Brassica carinata x Brassica oleracea) for introgression of black rot resistance genes into Indian cauliflower (B-oleracea var. botrytis L.).	EUPHYTICA	Indian cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.; C genome) is highly susceptible to black rot caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pam.) Dowson. Till now no durable resistance genes have been identified in C genome of Brassica. Two B. carinata genotypes, NPC-9 and HCA-6 were found highly resistant to Xcc race 1 and 4, most prevalent throughout the world. Inter-specific hybridization was attempted for introgression of resistance genes from B. carinata into Indian cauliflower using three different embryo rescue approaches. Reciprocal crosses were made between two B. carinata and 7 lines of Indian cauliflower. Very low rate of success was observed when B. oleracea lines were used as female parents. Among the three different approaches, direct embryo culture was the most successful for development of F-1 and BC1 population. Through ovule culture and direct embryo culture 58 F-1 hybrids were developed. Success rates for hybrid plant development through ovule culture and direct embryo culture were 1.04 and 11.33 %, respectively. All the F-1 hybrids were found to be highly resistant to Xcc race 1 and 4. Eleven NPC-9 based F-1 hybrids were used for development of BC1 population through direct embryo culture with a success rate of 30.76 %. Direct embryo culture can be used as an effective tool for introgression of desirable genes across Brassica species. Among 29 BC1 plants, 26 and 25 plants were highly resistant to Xcc race 4 and race 1, respectively. The population developed through inter-specific hybridization would open several avenues to develop durable black rot resistant lines in B. oleracea.	2015	10.1007/s10681-015-1352-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Effects of the alien cybrid cytoplasm on important quality traits need to be understood for their effective use in breeding programme. In analysing 38 Ogura cybrid cytoplasm-based cauliflower CMS lines, it was revealed that introgression of Ogura cytoplasm resulted in significant alteration in important quality traits. Cupric reducing antioxidant activity and ferric reducing ability of plasma values were increased up to 5-10 times in different genotypes. Among 38 analysed CMS lines, concentration of plant pigments such as anthocyanin, total chlorophylls and ascorbic acid was reduced in 21, 17 and 32 genotypes, respectively. However, the concentration of total carotenoids and -carotene was elevated in most of the CMS lines and total carotenoid was increased up to 20 times in the CMS line, Ogu13-85-2A. The results indicate the role of nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction and mitochondrial genome in determining concentration of different quality traits.	2017	10.1111/pbr.12478		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Dhaliwal, Inderpreet; Mason, Annaliese S.; Banga, Shashi; Bharti, Sakshi; Kaur, Beerpal; Gurung, Allison Mary; Salisbury, Phillip Anthony; Batley, Jacqueline; Banga, Surinder Singh	Cytogenetic and Molecular Characterization of B-Genome Introgression Lines of Brassica napus L.	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Brassica napus introgression lines (ILs), having B-genome segments from B. carinata, were assessed genetically for extent of introgression and phenotypically for siliqua shatter resistance. Introgression lines had 7-9% higher DNA content, were meiotically stable, and had almost normal pollen fertility/seed set. Segment introgressions were confirmed by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (fl-GISH), SSR analyses, and SNP studies. Genotyping with 48 B-genome specific SSRs detected substitutions from B3, B4, B6, and B7 chromosomes on 39 of the 69 ILs whereas SNP genotyping detected a total of 23 B-segments (>= 3 Mb) from B4, B6, and B7 introgressed into 10 of the 19 (C1, C2, C3, C5, C6, C8, C9, A3, A9, A10) chromosomes in 17 ILs. The size of substitutions varied from 3.0 Mb on chromosome A9 (IL59) to 42.44 Mb on chromosome C2 (IL54), ranging from 7 to 83% of the recipient chromosome. Average siliqua strength in ILs was observed to be higher than that of B. napus parents (2.2-6.0 vs. 1.9-4.0 mJ) while siliqua strength in some of the lines was almost equal to that of the donor parent B. carinata (6.0 vs. 7.2 mJ). These ILs, with large chunks of substituted B-genome, can prove to be a useful prebreeding resource for germplasm enhancement in B. napus, especially for siliqua shatter resistance.	2017	10.1534/g3.116.036442		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Linkage Mapping of Resistance to Reniform Nematode in Cotton following Introgression from Gossypium longicalyx (Hutch. & Lee)	CROP SCIENCE	Reniform nematodes (Rotylenchulus reniformis Linford & Oliveira) decrease U.S. production of Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., 2n = 52, 2[AD](1)) by more than US$100 million yr(-1). We report here on the mapping of a gene for extreme resistance that was introgressed from the African species G. longicalyx (Hutch. & Lee, 2n = 2x = 26; 2F(1)). The responsible allele, designated Ren(Ion), was localized to chromosome 11 by first screening A-subgenome simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker loci for parental polymorphism and then for association with resistance. The three most strongly coupled SSRs and a G. longicalyx gene conferring green seed fuzz, designated Fzg(Ion), were screened against 984 resistant and susceptible individuals of multiple backcross generations. We used marker data and pedigrees to identify nonrecombinant heterozygous parents and thereby avoid bias from repeated sampling of a recombination event. We constructed linkage maps after progeny testing a small population (147) and after implementing three alternative approaches better suited to larger populations-marker-assisted genotyping analysis, applying a cut-off value as population-wide genotyping criterion, and genotype-selective sampling. The maps concordantly indicated the order to be Fzg(Ion)-Ren(Ion)-BNL3279_114-BNL1066_156-BNL836_215, with most Ren-proximal bilaterally flanking markers within 6 cM of each other. The results will clearly facilitate use of Ren(Ion) in breeding, additional mapping, genomics, and prospective cloning.	2009	10.2135/cropsci2008.03.0129		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Developing molecular tools and insights into the Penstemon genome using genomic reduction and next-generation sequencing	BMC GENETICS	Background: Penstemon's unique phenotypic diversity, hardiness, and drought-tolerance give it great potential for the xeric landscaping industry. Molecular markers will accelerate the breeding and domestication of drought tolerant Penstemon cultivars by, creating genetic maps, and clarifying of phylogenetic relationships. Our objectives were to identify and validate interspecific molecular markers from four diverse Penstemon species in order to gain specific insights into the Penstemon genome. Results: We used a 454 pyrosequencing and GR-RSC (genome reduction using restriction site conservation) to identify homologous loci across four Penstemon species (P. cyananthus, P. davidsonii, P. dissectus, and P. fruticosus) representing three diverse subgenera with considerable genome size variation. From these genomic data, we identified 133 unique interspecific markers containing SSRs and INDELs of which 51 produced viable PCR-based markers. These markers produced simple banding patterns in 90% of the species x marker interactions (similar to 84% were polymorphic). Twelve of the markers were tested across 93, mostly xeric, Penstemon taxa (72 species), of which similar to 98% produced reproducible marker data. Additionally, we identified an average of one SNP per 2,890 bp per species and one per 97 bp between any two apparent homologous sequences from the four source species. We selected 192 homologous sequences, meeting stringent parameters, to create SNP markers. Of these, 75 demonstrated repeatable polymorphic marker functionality across the four sequence source species. Finally, sequence analysis indicated that repetitive elements were approximately 70% more prevalent in the P. cyananthus genome, the largest genome in the study, than in the smallest genome surveyed (P. dissectus). Conclusions: We demonstrated the utility of GR-RSC to identify homologous loci across related Penstemon taxa. Though PCR primer regions were conserved across a broadly sampled survey of Penstemon species (93 taxa), DNA sequence within these amplicons (12 SSR/INDEL markers) was highly diverse. With the continued decline in next-generation sequencing costs, it will soon be feasible to use genomic reduction techniques to simultaneously sequence thousands of homologous loci across dozens of Penstemon species. Such efforts will greatly facilitate our understanding of the phylogenetic structure within this important drought tolerant genus. In the interim, this study identified thousands of SNPs and over 50 SSRs/INDELs which should provide a foundation for future Penstemon phylogenetic studies and breeding efforts.	2013	10.1186/1471-2156-14-66		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker development	FALSE			FALSE	
Dong, Zhenying; Wang, Hongyan; Dong, Yuzhu; Wang, Yongming; Liu, Wei; Miao, Gaojian; Lin, Xiuyun; Wang, Daqing; Liu, Bao	Extensive Microsatellite Variation in Rice Induced by Introgression from Wild Rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.)	PLOS ONE	Background: It is widely accepted that interspecific hybridization may induce genomic instability in the resultant hybrids. However, few studies have been performed on the genomic analysis of homoploid hybrids and introgression lines. We have reported previously that by introgressive hybridization, a set of introgression lines between rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.) was successfully generated, and which have led to the release of several cultivars. Methodology: Using 96 microsatellite markers located in the nuclear and organelle genomes of rice, we investigated microsatellite stability in three typical introgression lines. Expression of a set of mismatch repair (MMR) genes and microsatellite-containing genes was also analyzed. Results/Conclusions: Compared with the recipient rice cultivar (Matsumae), 55 of the 96 microsatellite loci revealed variation in one or more of the introgression lines, and 58.2% of the altered alleles were shared by at least two lines, indicating that most of the alterations had occurred in the early stages of introgression before their further differentiation. 73.9% of the non-shared variations were detected only in one introgression line, i.e. RZ2. Sequence alignment showed that the variations included substitutions and indels that occurred both within the repeat tracts and in the flanking regions. Interestingly, expression of a set of MMR genes altered dramatically in the introgression lines relative to their rice parent, suggesting participation of the MMR system in the generation of microsatellite variants. Some of the altered microsatellite loci are concordant with changed expression of the genes harboring them, suggesting their possible cis-regulatory roles in controlling gene expression. Because these genes bear meaningful homology to known-functional proteins, we conclude that the introgression-induced extensive variation of microsatellites may have contributed to the novel phenotypes in the introgression lines.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0062317		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Donnison, IS; O'Sullivan, DM; Thomas, A; Canter, P; Moore, B; Armstead, I; Thomas, H; Edwards, KJ; King, IP	Construction of a Festuca pratensis BAC library for map-based cloning in Festulolium substitution lines	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Introgression in Festulolium is a potentially powerful tool to isolate genes for a large number of traits which differ between Festuca pratensis Huds. and Lolium perenne L. Not only are hybrids between the two species fertile, but the two genomes can be distinguished by genomic in situ hybridisation and a high frequency of recombination occurs between homoeologous chromosomes and chromosome segments. By a programme of introgression and a series of backcrosses, L. perenne lines have been produced which contain small F. pratensis substitutions. This material is a rich source of polymorphic markers targeted towards any trait carried on the F. pratensis substitution not observed in the L. perenne background. We describe here the construction of an F. pratensis BAC library, which establishes the basis of a map-based cloning strategy in L. perenne. The library contains 49,152 clones, with an average insert size of 112 kbp, providing coverage of 2.5 haploid genome equivalents. We have screened the library for eight amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) derived markers known to be linked to an F. pratensis gene introgressed into L. perenne and conferring a staygreen phenotype as a consequence of a mutation in primary chlorophyll catabolism. While for four of the markers it was possible to identify bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, the other four AFLPs were too repetitive to enable reliable identification of locus-specific BACs. Moreover, when the four BACs were partially sequenced, no obvious coding regions could be identified. This contrasted to BACs identified using cDNA sequences, when multiple genes were identified on the same BAC.	2005	10.1007/s00122-004-1870-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
dos Reis, Gabriela Barreto; Mesquita, Amanda Teixeira; Torres, Giovana Augusta; Andrade-Vieira, Larissa Fonseca; Pereira, Antonio Vander; Davide, Lisete Chamma	Genomic homeology between Pennisetum purpureum and Pennisetum glaucum (Poaceae)	COMPARATIVE CYTOGENETICS	The genus Pennisetum (Richard, 1805) includes two economically important tropical forage plants: Pennisetum purpureum (Schumacher, 1827) (elephant grass), with 2n = 4x = 28 chromosomes and genomes A'A'BB, and Pennisetum glaucum (Linnaeus, 1753) (pearl millet), with 2n = 2x = 14 chromosomes and genomes AA. The genetic proximity between them allows hybrids to be obtained (2n = 3x = 21) that yield forage of higher quality in relation to the parents. The study of genomic relationships provides subsidies for the knowledge about phylogenetic relations and evolution, and is useful in breeding programs seeking gene introgression. Concerning elephant grass and pearl millet, the homeology between the genomes A and A', and between these and the genome B, has been reported by conventional cytogenetic techniques. The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the degree of homeology between these genomes by means of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The results confirmed the homeology between the genomes A of pearl millet and A'B of elephant grass, and showed that there are differences in the distribution and proportion of homologous regions after hybridization. Discussion regarding the evolutionary origin of P. purpureum and P. glaucum was also included.	2014	10.3897/CompCytogen.v8i3.7732		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Du, Xue-Zhu; Ge, Xian-Hong; Zhao, Zhi-Gang; Li, Zai-Yun	Chromosome elimination and fragment introgression and recombination producing intertribal partial hybrids from Brassica napus x Lesquerella fendleri crosses	PLANT CELL REPORTS	The intertribal sexual hybrids between three Brassica napus (2n = 38) cultivars and Lesquerella fendleri (2n = 12) with the latter as pollen parent were obtained and characterized for their phenotypes and chromosomal and genomic constitutions. F-1 plants and their progenies mainly resembled female B. napus parents, while certain characters of L. fendleri were expressed in some plants, such as longer flowering period, basal clustering stems and particularly the glutinous layer on seed coats related to drought tolerance. Twenty-seven F-1 plants were cytologically classified into five types: type I (16 plants) had 2n = 38, type II (2) had 2n = 38-42, type III (3) had 2n = 31-38, type IV (5) had 2n = 25-31, and type V (1) had 2n = 19-22. Some hybrids and their progenies were mixoploids in nature with only 1-2 chromosomes or some chromosomal fragments of L. fendleri included in their cells. AFLP (Amplified fragments length polymorphism) analysis revealed that bands absent in B. napus, novel for two parents and specific for L. fendleri appeared in all F-1 plants and their progenies. Some progenies had the modified fatty acid profiles with higher levels of linoleic, linolenic, eicosanoic and erucic acids than those of B. napus parents. The occurrence of these partial hybrids with phenotypes, genomic and fatty acid alterations resulted possibly from the chromosome elimination and doubling accompanied by the introgression of alien DNA segments and genomic reorganization. The progenies with some useful traits from L. fendleri should be new and valuable resource for rapeseed breeding.	2008	10.1007/s00299-007-0452-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Econopouly, Bethany F.; McKay, John K.; Westra, Philip; Reid, Scott D.; Helm, Alan L.; Byrne, Patrick F.	Phenotypic diversity of Aegilops cylindrica (jointed goatgrass) accessions from the western United States under irrigated and dryland conditions	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT	Aegilops cylindrica Host (jointed goatgrass) is an exotic invasive weed in the western United States that causes economic loss due to competition with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and contamination of wheat grain. Further, because Ae. cylindrica is a wild relative of wheat, interspecific hybridization is a possible mechanism for the introgression of advantageous genes from wheat to the weedy species. The risk of introgression of traits conferring environmental stress tolerance, such as drought tolerance, from transgenic wheat has not been studied and is of high concern because it could increase the weed's competitiveness with wheat, as well as its ability to invade novel habitats. Genetic diversity has been reported among western U.S. Ae. cylindrica accessions, however, studies to determine whether genetic diversity relates to phenotypic diversity have been limited. Here, 30 accessions of Ae. cylindrica from the western U.S. were evaluated over two years at two Colorado locations: Haxtun in 2008-2009 and Fort Collins in 2009-2010. Days to flowering, plant height, number of tillers produced per plant, number of spikelets per spike, and number of spikelets per plant were evaluated under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. Results indicate significant (P<0.01) variation among accessions for each of the traits for both years. Additionally, in 2009-2010 there was a significant (P<0.01) effect of irrigation on all traits, except days to flowering. Similarly, all traits except days to flowering showed a significant effect of the interaction of accession with treatment (P<0.05) in 2009-2010. The study shows that variation exists in traits related to competitive ability and fitness. Our data also suggest differences among accessions in sensitivity to water availability. This observation needs to be confirmed in additional environments. Implications of our results for evaluation of transgene introgression are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Edet, Offiong U.; Gorafi, Yasir S. A.; Nasuda, Shuhei; Tsujimoto, Hisashi	DArTseq-based analysis of genomic relationships among species of tribe Triticeae	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	Precise utilization of wild genetic resources to improve the resistance of their cultivated relatives to environmental growth limiting factors, such as salinity stress and diseases, requires a clear understanding of their genomic relationships. Although seriously criticized, analyzing these relationships in tribe Triticeae has largely been based on meiotic chromosome pairing in hybrids of wide crosses, a specialized and labourious strategy. In this study, DArTseq, an efficient genotyping-by-sequencing platform, was applied to analyze the genomes of 34 Triticeae species. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among diploid and polyploid Aegilops and Triticum species, including hexaploid wheat. Tentatively, we have identified the diploid genomes that are likely to have been involved in the evolution of five polyploid species of Aegilops, which have remained unresolved for decades. Explanations which cast light on the progenitor of the A genomes and the complex genomic status of the B/G genomes of polyploid Triticum species in the Emmer and Timopheevi lineages of wheat have also been provided. This study has, therefore, demonstrated that DArTseq genotyping can be effectively applied to analyze the genomes of plants, especially where their genome sequence information are not available.	2018	10.1038/s41598-018-34811-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Establishment of introgression libraries in hybrid rye (Secale cereale L.) from an Iranian primitive accession as a new tool for rye breeding and genomics	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Genetic diversity of elite breeding material can be increased by introgression of exotic germplasm to ensure long-term selection response. The objective of our study was to develop and characterize the first two rye introgression libraries generated by marker-assisted backcrossing and demonstrate their potential application for improving the baking quality of rye. Starting from a cross between inbred line L2053-N (recurrent parent) and a heterozygous Iranian primitive population Altevogt 14160 (donor) two backcross (BC) and three selfing generations were performed to establish introgression libraries A and B. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP (R) markers) and simple sequences repeats (SSRs) were employed to select and characterize candidate introgression lines (pre-ILs) from BC1 to BC2S3. The two introgression libraries comprise each 40 BC2S3 pre-ILs. For analyzing the phenotypic effects of the exotic donor chromosome segment (DCS) we evaluated the per se performance for pentosan and starch content in replicated field trials at each of four locations in 2005 and 2006. Introgression library A and B cover 74 and 59% of the total donor genome, respectively. The pre-ILs contained mostly two to four homozygous DCS, with a mean length of 12.9 cM (A) and 10.0 cM (B). We detected eight (A) and nine (B) pre-ILs with a significant (P < 0.05) higher pentosan content and two pre-ILs (B) with a significant (P < 0.05) higher starch content than the elite recurrent parent. Thus, our results indicate that exotic genetic resources in rye carry favorable alleles for baking quality traits, which can be exploited for improving the elite breeding material by marker-assisted selection (MAS). These introgression libraries can substantially foster rye breeding programs and provide a promising opportunity to proceed towards functional genomics.	2008	10.1007/s00122-008-0808-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Favero, A. P.; Padua, J. G.; Costa, T. S.; Gimenes, M. A.; Godoy, I. J.; Moretzsohn, M. C.; Michelotto, M. D.	New hybrids from peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and synthetic amphidiploid crosses show promise in increasing pest and disease tolerance	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH	The primary gene pool of the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L., allotetraploid AABB) is very narrow for some important characteristics, such as resistance to pests and diseases. However, the Arachis wild diploid species, particularly those from the section Arachis, still have these characteristics. To improve peanut crops, genes from the wild species can be introgressed by backcrossing the hybrids with A. hypogaea. When diploid species whose genomes are similar to those of the cultivated peanut are crossed, sterile hybrids result. Artificially doubling the number of chromosomes of these hybrids results in fertile synthetic polyploids. The objectives of this study were: 1) to obtain progenies by crossing amphidiploids with the cultivated peanut, and 2) to characterize these two groups of materials (amphidiploids and progenies) so that they may be efficiently conserved and used. Using morphological, molecular, and pollen viability descriptors we evaluated one cultivar of A. hypogaea (IAC 503), eight synthetic amphidiploids, and the progenies resulting from four distinct combinations of crossing between IAC 503 and four amphidiploids.	2015	10.4238/2015.December.11.17		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Feldman, M; Levy, AA	Allopolyploidy - a shaping force in the evolution of wheat genomes	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Recent studies have shown that allopolyploidy accelerates genome evolution in wheat in two ways: ( 1) allopolyploidization triggers rapid genome changes ( revolutionary changes) through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic alterations, and ( 2) the allopolyploid condition facilitates sporadic genomic changes during the life of the species ( evolutionary changes) that are not attainable at the diploid level. The revolutionary changes comprise ( 1) non-random elimination of coding and non-coding DNA sequences, ( 2) epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation of coding and non-coding DNA leading, among others, to gene silencing, ( 3) activation of genes and retroelements which in turn alters the expression of adjacent genes. These highly reproducible changes occur in the F-1 hybrids or in the first generation( s) of the nascent allopolyploids and were similar to those that occurred twice in nature: first in the formation of allotetraploid wheat (similar to 0.5 million years ago) and second in the formation of hexaploid wheat ( similar to 10,000 years ago). Elimination of non-coding sequences from one of the two homoeologous pairs in tetraploids and from two homoeologous pairs in hexaploids, augments the differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes at the polyploid level, thus providing the physical basis for the diploid-like meiotic behavior of allopolyploid wheat. Regulation of gene expression may lead to improved inter-genomic interactions. Gene inactivation brings about rapid diploidization while activation of genes through demethylation or through transcriptional activation of retroelements altering the expression of adjacent genes, leads to novel expression patterns. The evolutionary changes comprise ( 1) horizontal intergenomic transfer of chromosome segments between the constituent genomes, ( 2) production of recombinant genomes through hybridization and introgression between different allopolyploid species or, more seldom, between allopolyploids and diploids, and ( 3) mutations. These phenomena, emphasizing the plasticity of the genome with regards to both structure and function, might improve the adaptability of the newly formed allopolyploids and facilitate their rapid and successful establishment in nature.

Feng, Jiuhuan; Jan, Chao-Chien	Introgression and molecular tagging of Rf(4), a new male fertility restoration gene from wild sunflower Helianthus maximiliani L.	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and its fertility restoration (Rf) genes are critical tools for hybrid seed production to utilize heterosis. In sunflower, CMS PET1 and the associated Rf gene Rf(1) is the only source extensively used in commercial hybrid production. The objective of this research was to develop new sources of CMS and fertility restorers to broaden the genetic diversity of hybrid seed production. We identified a new type of CMS, named as CMS GIG2, from an interspecific cross between Helianthus giganteus accession1934 and H. annuus cv. HA 89. Based on reactions to a set of standard Rf testers, CMS GIG2 is different from all previously reported CMS types, including the CMS GIG1 from another H. giganteus accession. We also identified an Rf gene for CMS GIG2 from wild species H. maximiliani accession 1631. The CMS GIG2 and its restoration gene were introduced into HA 89 background through recurrent backcross and single plant selection techniques. Genetic analysis revealed that the CMS GIG2-Rf system is controlled by a completely dominant gene, named as Rf(4), and the gene additive and dominance effects were estimated as 39.9 and 42.2%, respectively, in the HA 89 background. The gene Rf(4) was mapped onto linkage group 3 with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and RFLP-derived STS-marker, and is about 0.9 cM away from the SSR marker ORS1114 based on a segregation population of 933 individuals. The CMS GIG2-Rf(4) system tagged by molecular markers provides an alternative genetic source for hybrid breeding in the sunflower crop.	2008	10.1007/s00122-008-0769-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ferrari, MR; Fradkin, M; Greizerstein, EJ; Naranjo, CA; Poggio, L	Nucleolar organizer activity and competition in Tricepiro Don Rene INTA, a synthetic forage crop	CARYOLOGIA	The nucleolar organizer activity and the presence of rDNA zones were studied in Tricepiro Don Rene INTA, a synthetic forage crop (2n=42, 6x, AABBRR with introgression of Thinopyrum in 6A chromosome). The use of pTa71 probe revealed the presence of six rDNA zones but Ag-NOR indicated the presence of only four NORs (nucleolus organizer regions). Differential amphiplasty phenomenon could explain the inactivity of some rDNA zones. Simultaneous use of FISH (pTa71 probe) and DAPI banding analysis indicated that the chromosomes with rDNA zones belong to two rye and to four wheat chromosomes. The maximum number of nucleoli observed in somatic cells and the number of chromosomes with secondary constrictions agreed with the four active NORs detected with the Ag-staining method. The use of the pSc119.2 probe allowed to recognize that chromosomes with secondary constrictions are the wheat chromosomes 1B and 6 B. The results obtained using classical and molecular cytogenetics lead us to conclude that this crop has a similar behavior to that observed in hexaploid triticales in relation to the phenomenon of amphiplasty.

Tricepiro (2n = 6x = 42) is a synthetic cereal obtained by G. Covas in Argentina (1972), which crosses hexaploid triticale (2n = 6x = 42) and octoploid Trigopiro (2n = 8x = 56). Several years of breeding produced a forage crop with valuable characteristics from Secale, Triticum, and Thinopyrum. The aim of this work is to analyse the real genomic constitution of this important synthetic crop. In situ hybridization using total DNA of Secale, Triticum, and Thinopyrum as a probe (GISH) labelled with biotin and (or) digoxigenin showed that tricepiro is composed of 14 rye chromosomes and 28 wheat chromosomes. Small zones of introgression of Thinopyrum on wheat chromosomes were detected. The FISH using the rye repetitive DNA probe pSc 119.2 labelled with biotin let us characterize the seven pairs of rye chromosomes. Moreover, several wheat chromosomes belonging to A and B genomes were distinguished. Therefore, tricepiro is a synthetic hexaploid (2n = 6x = 42) being AABBRR in its genomic composition, with zones of introgression of Thinopyrum in the A genome of wheat.	2005	10.1139/G04-081		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Fishman, Lila; Willis, John H.	A cytonuclear incompatibility causes anther sterility in Mimulus hybrids	EVOLUTION	Multilocus interactions (also known as Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities) are thought to be the major source of hybrid inviability and sterility. Because cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes have conflicting evolutionary interests and are often highly coevolved, cytonuclear incompatibilities may be among the first to develop in incipient species. Here, we report the discovery of cytoplasm-dependent anther sterility in hybrids between closely related Mimulus species, outcrossing M. guttatus and selfing M. nasutus. A novel pollerdess anther phenotype was observed in F-2 hybrids with the M. guttatus cytoplasm (F-2G) but not in the reciprocal F-2N hybrids, F, hybrids or parental genotypes. The pattern of phenotypic segregation in the F-2G hybrids and two backcross populations fit a Mendelian single-locus recessive model, allowing us to map the underlying nuclear locus to a small region on LG7 of the Mimulus linkage map. Anther sterility was associated with a 20% reduction in flower size in backcross hybrids and we mapped a major cytoplasm-dependent corolla width QTL with its peak at the anther sterility locus. We argue that the cytonuclear anther sterility seen in hybrids reflects the presence of a cryptic cytoplasmic mate sterility (CMS) and restorer system within the hermaphroditic M. guttatus population and therefore name the anther sterility locus restorer-of-male-fertility (RMF). The genetic mapping of RMF is a first step toward testing hypotheses about the molecular basis, individual fitness consequences, and ecological context of CMS and restoration in a system without stable CMS-restorer polymorphism (i.e., gynodioecy). The discovery of cryptic CMS in a hermaphroditic wildflower further suggests that selfish cytoplasmic evolution may play an important, but often undetected, role in shaping patterns of hybrid incompatibility and interspecific introgression in plants.	2006	10.1554/05-708.1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Fradkin, Maia; Rosa Ferrari, Maria; Isabel Remis, Maria; Jose Greizerstein, Eduardo; Poggio, Lidia	Genome and rye chromosome distribution in tricepiro "Don Rene INTA", a synthetic forage	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	The tricepiro "Don Ren, INTA" is an artificial hybrid with 2n = 42 chromosomes, including 14 rye (RR) and 28 wheat (AABB) chromosomes, with introgression of Thinopyrum ponticum (Podp.) Barkw. et Dewey on chromosome 6A. The aim of this work was to study the spatial distribution of the genomes and chromosomes of rye and wheat in metaphase cells from the root tip of this hybrid. The rye chromosomes were recognized by genome in situ hybridization using total genomic DNA as a probe of rye and wheat DNA as the blocking agent. Two points were determined in each cell: one representing the genomic mean distance of rye chromosomes (G(R)MD) and the other the genomic mean distance of wheat chromosomes (G(W)MD). The distance between the rye chromosomes and G(R)MD and G(W)MD showed no statistically significant difference, thus indicating that there would be no differential spatial domains for both genomes. The fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of rye chromosomes using the pSc119.2 probe suggested that all chromosome pairs present somatic association in mitotic metaphase.	2012	10.1007/s10722-012-9875-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Toward the elucidation of cytoplasmic diversity in North American grape breeding programs	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Plants have an intriguing tripartite genetic system: Nuclear genome x Mitochondria x Plastids and their interactions may impact germplasm breeding. In grapevine, the study of cytoplasmic genomes has been limited, and their role with respect to grapevine germplasm diversity has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the results of an analysis of the cytoplasmic diversity among 6073 individuals (comprising cultivars, interspecific hybrids and segregating progenies) are presented. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was used to elucidate plastid and mitochondrial DNA sequences, and results were analyzed using multivariate techniques. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects were annotated in reference to plastid and mitochondrial genome sequences. The cytoplasmic diversity identified was structured according to synthetic domestication groups (wine and raisin/table gr.ape types) and interspecific-hybridization-driven groups with introgression from North American Vitis species, identifying five cytoplasmic groups and four major clusters. Fifty-two SNP markers were used to describe the diversity of the germplasm. Ten organelle genes showed distinct SNP annotations and effect predictions, of which six were chloroplast-derived and three were mitochondrial genes, in addition to one mitochondrial SNP affecting a nonannotated open reading frame. The results suggest that the application of GBS will aid in the study of cytoplasmic genomes in grapevine, which will enable further studies on the role of cytoplasmic genomes in grapevine germplasm, and then allow the exploitation of these sources of diversity in breeding.	2016	10.1007/s11032-016-0538-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

In a germplasm collection, rare wild T. urartu lines with the presence of T. monococcum alleles were found. This stimulated our interest to develop interspecific introgression lines of T. urartu in T. monococcum, a breeding tool currently implemented in several crop species. Moreover, the experiments reported were designed to reveal the existence in nature of A(m)/A(u) intermediate forms and to clarify whether the two species are at least marginally sexually compatible. From hand-made interspecific crosses, almost-sterile F-1 plants were obtained when the seed-bearing parent was T. monococcum. A high degree of fertility was, however, evident in some advanced generations, particularly when T. urartu donors were molecularly more related to T. monococcum. Analysis of the marker populations demonstrated chromosome pairing and recombination in F-1 hybrid plants. Forty-six introgression lines were developed using a line of T. monococcum with several positive agronomic traits as a recurrent parent. Microsatellite markers were tested on A(u) and A(m) genomes, ordered in a T. monococcum molecular map, and used to characterize the exotic DNA fragments present in each introgression line. In a test based on 28 interspecific introgression lines, the existence of genetic variation associated with T. urartu chromosome fragments was proven for the seed content of carotenoids, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, and zinc. The molecular state of available introgression lines is summarized.	2014	10.1534/g3.114.013623		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

In this study, we aim to initiate and study gene flow between maize and Z. perennis via a special aneuploid plant (MDT) derived from an interspecific hybrid of the two species. The chromosome constitution and morphological characters of MDT as well as certain backcross progenies were examined. Results from genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) indicate that aneuploid MDT consisted of nine maize chromosomes and 30 Zea perennis chromosomes. The backcross progenies of MDTxmaize displayed significant diversity of vegetative and ear morphology; several unusual plants with specific chromosome constitution were founded in its progenies. Some special perennial progeny with several maize chromosomes were obtained by backcrossing MDT with Zea perennis, and the first whole chromosome introgression from maize to Zea perennis was detected in this study. With this novel material and method, a number of maize-tetraploid teosinte addition or substitution lines can be generated for further study, which has great significance to maize and Zea perennis genetic research, especially for promoting introgression and transferring desirable traits.	2015	10.1016/S2095-3119(14)60874-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Fu Xue-lin; Lu Yong-gen; Liu Xiang-dong; Li Jin-quan; Zhao Xing-juan	Cytological Behavior of Hybridization Barriers Between Oryza sativa and Oryza officinalis	AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES IN CHINA	Oryza officinalis is one of the important wild species in the tertiary gene pool of Oryza saliva. It has a number of elite genes for rice breeding in resistance or tolerance. However, breeding barriers are so serious that the gene transfer is much difficult by sexual cross method between O. saliva and O. officinalis. Characteristics of the breeding barriers were systemically studied in this paper. When both the diploid (AA, 2n=2x=24) and autotetraploid (AAAA, 2n=4x=48) cultivated rice were crossed as maternal parents with O. officinalis (CC, 2n=2x=24), none F, hybrid seeds were obtained. The young hybrid ovaries aborted at 13-16 d after pollinations (DAP). By rescuing hybrid embryos, in vitro F(1) plantlets were obtained in 2Xx2X combinations with the crossabilities lower than 0.5%. Lower rates of double-fertilization and abnormal development of hybrid embryo and endosperm were mainly observed in both combinations of 2Xx2X and 4Xx2X. Free endosperm nuclei in hybrid degenerated early at I DAP in a large scale. Almost no normal endosperm cells formed at 3 DAP. Development of a lot of embryos ceased at globular- or pear-shaped stage as well as some degenerated gradually. The hybrid plantlets were both male and female sterility. Due to the abnormal development, a diversity of abnormal embryo sacs formed in hybrids, and hybrid pollen grains were typically abortive. It showed that conflicts of genome A and C in hybrid induced abnormal meioses of meiocytes.	2011	10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60143-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Fu XueLin; Lu YongGen; Liu XiangDong; Li JinQuan; Feng JiuHuan	Cytological mechanisms of interspecific incrossability and hybrid sterility between Oryza sativa L. and O. alta Swallen	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN	Oryza sativa and O. alta belong to AA and CCDD genomes in Oryza, respectively. Interspecific reproductive isolation limits the transfer of favorable genes from O. alta into O. sativa. The cytological mechanisms of interspecific incrossability and hybrid sterility between O. sativa and O. alta were studied systematically in this paper. We indentified two cytological causes of interspecific incrossability. First, we observed embryo sac incompatibility that caused fertilization barriers of variable severity such as non-fertilization, fertilization stagnation and egg cell single-fertilization. Second, we observed hybrid inviability, the major cause for incrossability, apparent from hybrid embryo developmental stagnation and embryo abortion. Hybrid sterility included both embryo sac sterility and pollen sterility. The hybrid embryo sac was completely sterile and exhibited mainly embryo sac degeneration. Hybrid pollen was also sterile and mainly typical abortive. Hybrid sterility was mainly caused by severely abnormal meioses of megasporocytes and pollen mother cells; it is the most important abnormality, being chromosome sterility. Several methods are suggested to overcome the interspecific reproductive isolation between O. sativa and O. alta.	2007	10.1007/s11434-007-0138-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Fu, Donghui; Qian, Wei; Zou, Jun; Meng, Jinling	Genetic dissection of intersubgenomic heterosis in Brassica napus carrying genomic components of B. rapa	EUPHYTICA	Although strong intersubgenomic heterosis for seed production has been observed between "natural'' domesticated Brassica napus (rapeseed, AACC) and a new type of rapeseed into which subgenomic components of Brassica rapa (AA) have been introgressed, the molecular genetic mechanism of this intersubgenomic heterosis is not understood. In this study, a recombinant inbred line population of new type rapeseed derived from a cross between B. napus and B. rapa, together with a population from a backcross with the parental line of B. napus, was used to identify single-locus quantitative trait locus (QTL) and interacting QTL pairs for yield and nine yield-related traits. More than half of single-locus QTLs and interacting QTL pairs detected were involved with the novel alleles induced by the introgression of B. rapa. The alleles directly from B. rapa A genome played a secondary role in contributing to intersubgenomic heterosis. Allelic and nonallelic interactions of both novel alleles generated by B. rapa introgression and the alleles directly from B. rapa A genome contributed to the intersubgenomic heterosis between "natural'' domesticated rapeseed and new type rapeseed into which B. rapa had been introgressed. Six loci for fixed heterosis were identified and their possible applications are also discussed.	2012	10.1007/s10681-011-0533-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression ,lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Fukuhara, Shuto; Muakrong, Narathid; Kikuchi, Shinji; Tanya, Patcharin; Sassa, Hidenori; Koba, Takato; Srinives, Peerasak	Cytological characterization of an interspecific hybrid in Jatropha and its progeny reveals preferential uniparental chromosome transmission and interspecific translocation	BREEDING SCIENCE	Genetic variation in Jatropha curcas, a prospective biodiesel plant, is limited, and interspecific hybridization needed for its genetic improvement. Progeny from interspecific crosses between J. curcas and Jatropha integerrima can be used to improve agronomic characters and to increase oil content and yield. However, these hybrids have not been characterized cytologically. The present study was aimed at the analysis of chromosome behavior during meiosis and chromosome composition of S-1 plants derived from an interspecific F-1 hybrid using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Bivalents that formed as a result of interspecific pairing were frequently observed, suggesting the presence of homoeologous chromosomes from the two species. Almost half of microspores were derived from the reduction division; GISH analysis indicated random transmission of the parent chromosomes to microspores. Male fertility measured as pollen staining with acetocarmine was 48.4%. In contrast, GISH analysis of Si plants revealed preferential transmission of J. curcas chromosomes. We also found segment exchange between chromosomes of the two species (interspecific translocation) by GISH and FISH analyses. Introgression of J integerrima chromosome segments into the J. curcas genome would help to improve Jatropha cultivars for mass production.	2016	10.1270/jsbbs.16069		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Fuzinatto, V. A.; Pagliarini, M. S.; Valle, C. B.	Microsporogenesis in sexual Brachiaria hybrids (Poaceae)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH	Three sexual interspecific hybrids of Brachiaria (HBGC076, HBGC009, and HBGC014) resulting from crosses between B. ruziziensis (female genitor) and B. decumbens and B. brizantha (male genitors) produced by Embrapa Beef Cattle in the 1980s were cytologically analyzed by conventional methods for meiotic studies. The cytogenetic analysis showed the occurrence of common meiotic abnormalities among them. The most frequent abnormalities were those related to irregular chromosome segregation due to polyploidy. Other abnormalities, such as chromosome stickiness, absence of cytokinesis, irregular cytokinesis, abnormal spindle orientation, and abnormal nucleolus disintegration, were found in the three hybrids, while, chromosome disintegration was detected only in HBGC014. All the abnormalities, except for abnormal nucleolus disintegration, can cause unbalanced gamete formation, leading to pollen sterility. Multivalent chromosome association at diakinesis revealed genome affinity between the two parental species in the hybrids, suggesting some possibility for gene introgression. Presently, the Brachiaria breeding program has the objective of releasing, primarily, apomictic hybrids as new cultivars since they do not segregate but preserve the genetic makeup indefinitely. Besides, they result in homogeneous pastures which are easier to manage. The sexual hybrids, however, are paramount in the breeding program: they work as 'bridges' to introgress traits of interest into the apomictic genotypes. The cytogenetic analyses of these three hybrids substantiate their maintenance in the breeding program due to low frequency of meiotic abnormalities, complemented by interesting agronomic traits. They may be used in crosses to generate new cultivars in the future.	2007			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Gaebelein, Roman; Alnajar, Dima; Koopmann, Birger; Mason, Annaliese S.	Hybrids between Brassica napus and B. nigra show frequent pairing between the B and A/C genomes and resistance to blackleg	CHROMOSOME RESEARCH	High frequencies of homoeologous and even non-homologous chromosome recombination in Brassica hybrids can transfer useful traits between genomes, but also destabilise synthetic allopolyploids. We produced triploid hybrids (2n = 3x = ABC) from the cross B. napus (rapeseed, 2n = 4x = AACC) x B. nigra (black mustard, 2n = 2x = BB) by embryo rescue and allohexaploid hybrids (2n = 6x = AABBCC = 54) by chromosome doubling of the triploids. These hybrids demonstrated resistance to blackleg disease (causal agent: Leptosphaeria maculans) inherited from their B. nigra parent. In order to assess the possibility of transfer of this resistance between the B genome and the A and C subgenomes of B. napus, as well as to assess the genomic stability of allohexaploids from the cross B. napus x B. nigra, frequencies of non-homologous chromosome pairing in these hybrids were assessed using classical cytogenetics and genomic in-situ hybridization. Meiosis was highly irregular, and non-homologous chromosome pairing between the B genome and the A/C genomes was common in both triploid hybrids (observed in 38% of pollen mother cells) and allohexaploid hybrids (observed in 15% of pollen mother cells). Our results suggest that introgression of blackleg resistance from the B genome into the A or C genomes should be possible, but that allohexaploids from this genome combination are likely unstable.	2019	10.1007/s10577-019-09612-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Comparative analysis of repetitive sequences among species from the potato and the tomato clades	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims The genus Solanum includes important vegetable crops and their wild relatives. Introgression of their useful traits into elite cultivars requires effective recombination between hom(e) ologues, which is partially determined by genome sequence differentiation. In this study we compared the repetitive genome fractions of wild and cultivated species of the potato and tomato clades in a phylogenetic context. Methods Genome skimming followed by a clustering approach was used as implemented in the Repeat-Explorer pipeline. Repeat classes were annotated and the sequences of their main domains were compared. Key Results Repeat abundance and genome size were correlated and the larger genomes of species in the tomato clade were found to contain a higher proportion of unclassified elements. Families and lineages of repetitive elements were largely conserved between the clades, but their relative proportions differed. The most abundant repeats were Ty3/Gypsy elements. Striking differences in abundance were found in the highly dynamic Ty3/Gypsy Chromoviruses and Ty1/Copia Tork elements. Within the potato clade, early branching Solanum cardiophyllum showed a divergent repeat profile. There were also contrasts between cultivated and wild potatoes, mostly due to satellite amplification in the cultivated species. Interspersed repeat profiles were very similar among potatoes. The repeat profile of Solanum etuberosum was more similar to that of the potato clade. Conclusions The repeat profiles in Solanum seem to be very similar despite genome differentiation at the level of collinearity. Removal of transposable elements by unequal recombination may have been responsible for structural rearrangements across the tomato clade. Sequence variability in the tomato clade is congruent with clade-specific amplification of repeats after its divergence from S. etuberosum and potatoes. The low differentiation among potato and its wild relatives at the level of interspersed repeats may explain the difficulty in discriminating their genomes by genomic in situ hybridization techniques.	2019	10.1093/aob/mcy186		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression/crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

PLANT BREEDING	Introgression Lines (ILs) carrying alien genomic segments in the homozygous state may or may not be able to contribute positively to the phenotype on account of replacement of cultivated genome segment, however, the genetic elite in heterozygous condition can be attributed to the presence of both recipient and donor genome complements. Therefore, overdominance or pseudo-overdominance effect at the heterozygous loci is anticipated. Set of 318 ILs, carrying several genomic segments from "A" genome donor wild species, were used for developing test hybrids with CMS line PMS17A. Of these, three hybrids observed significant yield advantage (>25%) over recurrent parents and checks. Parental ILs of these hybrids viz., IL326, IL901 and IL951 carried 5.62%, 2.52% introgression from Oryza rufipogon and 6.71% from Oryza nivara, respectively. These ILs were also crossed with their recurrent parent to develop introgression line hybrids (ILHs) to observe the contribution of the alien segment(s), in the homozygous and heterozygous state. The traits studied have higher mean value when genomic segments from wild species were in the heterozygous state as compared to the homozygous state.	2019	10.1111/pbr.12692		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

PLOS ONE	Utilization of "hidden genes" from wild species has emerged as a novel option for enrichment of genetic diversity for productivity traits. In rice we have generated more than 2000 lines having introgression from 'A' genome-donor wild species of rice in the genetic background of popular varieties PR114 and Pusa44 were developed. Out of these, based on agronomic acceptability, 318 lines were used for developing rice hybrids to assess the effect of introgressions in heterozygous state. These introgression lines and their recurrent parents, possessing fertility restoration ability for wild abortive (WA) cytoplasm, were crossed with cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line PMS17A to develop hybrids. Hybrids developed from recurrent parents were used as checks to compare the performance of 318 hybrids developed by hybridizing alien introgression lines with PMS17A. Seventeen hybrids expressed a significant increase in yield and its component traits over check hybrids. These 17 hybrids were re-evaluated in large-size replicated plots. Of these, four hybrids, viz., ILH299, ILH326, ILH867 and ILH901, having introgressions from O. rufipogon and two hybrids (ILH921 and ILH951) having introgressions from O. nivara showed significant heterosis over parental introgression line, recurrent parents and check hybrids for grain yield-related traits. Alien introgressions were detected in the lines taken as male parents for developing six superior hybrids, using a set of 100 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Percent introgression showed a range of 2.24 from in O. nivara to 7.66 from O. rufipogon. The introgressed regions and their putative association with yield components in hybrids is reported and discussed.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0096939		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING	Limited backcrossing was followed to introgress useful variability, needed for improving grain morphology and milling traits, from wild Oryza species into two indica cultivars PR114 and Pusa44.These alien introgressions lines (ILs), having similar grain quality parameters to the recurrent parent, were used for developing rice hybrids to assess the effect of these introgressions in the heterozygous state and to assess their grain quality parameters, as most of the hybrids commercialized in the tropics have inferior grain quality. These ILs and their recurrent parents, possessing fertility restoration ability for wide abortive cytoplasm, were crossed with CMS line PMS 17A to generate introgressions line hybrids (ILHs).Hybrids developed from recurrent parents were used as a check to compare the performance of ILHs. Based on yield and phenotypic acceptability, six ILHs having enriched genome of O. rufipogon and O. nivara were selected and analyzed for grain quality traits. All six hybrids observed significant improvement in milled rice recovery (up to 10%), head rice recovery (up to 25%) over ILs and check hybrids.lntrogressions were analyzed using polymorphic SSR markers.The majority of O. rufipogon and O. nivara alleles identified in the study seems to be effective across recipient genotypes and could be used effectively in quality breeding programs.	2018	10.5958/0975-6906.2018.00020.2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gao, Xin; Liu, Shu Wei; Sun, Qun; Xia, Guang Min	High frequency of HMW-GS sequence variation through somatic hybridization between Agropyron elongatum and common wheat	PLANTA	A symmetric somatic hybridization was performed to combine the protoplasts of tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Fertile regenerants were obtained which were morphologically similar to tall wheatgrass, but which contained some introgression segments from wheat. An SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a number of non-parental high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) were present in the symmetric somatic hybridization derivatives. These sequences were amplified, cloned and sequenced, to deliver 14 distinct HMW-GS coding sequences, eight of which were of the y-type (Hy1-Hy8) and six x-type (Hx1-Hx6). Five of the cloned HMW-GS sequences were successfully expressed in E. coli. The analysis of their deduced peptide sequences showed that they all possessed the typical HMW-GS primary structure. Sequence alignments indicated that Hx5 and Hy1 were probably derived from the tall wheatgrass genes Aex5 and Aey6, while Hy2, Hy3, Hx1 and Hy6 may have resulted from slippage in the replication of a related biparental gene. We found that both symmetric and asymmetric somatic hybridization could promote the emergence of novel alleles. We discussed the origination of allelic variation of HMW-GS genes in somatic hybridization, which might be the result from the response to genomic shock triggered by the merger and interaction of biparent genomes.	2010	10.1007/s00425-009-1040-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE

Despite its interest for common eggplant (S. melongena L.) breeding, up to now no success has been obtained in introgression breeding of eggplant with American Solanum species. Using an interspecific hybrid between common eggplant and S. elaeagnifolium as maternal parent we were able to obtain several fruits with viable seed after pollination with S. melongena pollen. Twenty individuals of the first backcross (BC1) generation were crossed again to the S. melongena parent and second backcross (BC2) seed was obtained for 17 of them, suggesting that most of the genome of S. elaeagnifolium is likely to be represented in the set of BC2 families. Five plants of each of the two parents, interspecific hybrid and BC1 generation were characterized with morphological descriptors and for pollen viability. The interspecific hybrid was intermediate among parents, although in overall morphological characteristics more similar to the S. elaeagnifolium parent. However, pollen viability of the hybrid was very low (2.6%). The BC1 generation was intermediate in characteristics between the hybrid and the S. melongena parent, with pollen viability increasing to an average of 19.4%. The root system of the inter specific hybrid indicated that it is able to explore larger areas of the soil than the S. melongena parent. The phenolics profile of the fruit of the two parents and hybrid revealed a higher diversity in phenolic constituents in S. elaeagnifolium compared to S. melongena, where the major phenolic compound was chlorogenic acid, while the interspecific hybrid was intermediate. By using flow cytometry it was found that S. elaeagnifolium, S. melongena, and their interspecific hybrid were diploid, although the genome size of S. elaeagnifolium was slightly smaller than that of S. melongena. Our results represent the first report of successful development of backcross generations of common eggplant with a New World Solarium species. This makes available a relatively unexplored, phylogenetically distant genepool for eggplant breeding. The backcross materials obtained can make a relevant contribution to developing new eggplant cultivars with new nutritional and environmental properties.	2019	10.1016/j.scienta.2018.11.018		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Here we use graph clustering implemented in the RepeatExplorer (RE) pipeline to analyze homoeologous 5S rDNA arrays at the genomic level searching for hybridogenic origin of species. Data were obtained from more than 80 plant species, including several well-defined allopolyploids and homoploid hybrids of different evolutionary ages and from widely dispersed taxonomic groups. Results (i) Diploids show simple circular-shaped graphs of their 5S rDNA clusters. In contrast, most allopolyploids and other interspecific hybrids exhibit more complex graphs composed of two or more interconnected loops representing intergenic spacers (IGS). (ii) There was a relationship between graph complexity and locus numbers. (iii) The sequences and lengths of the 5S rDNA units reconstituted in silico from k-mers were congruent with those experimentally determined. (iv) Three-genomic comparative cluster analysis of reads from allopolyploids and progenitor diploids allowed identification of homoeologous 5S rRNA gene families even in relatively ancient (c. 1 Myr) Gossypium and Brachypodium allopolyploids which already exhibit uniparental partial loss of rDNA repeats. (v) Finally, species harboring introgressed genomes exhibit exceptionally complex graph structures. Conclusion We found that the cluster graph shapes and graph parameters (k-mer coverage scores and connected component index) well-reflect the organization and intragenomic homogeneity of 5S rDNA repeats. We propose that the analysis of 5S rDNA cluster graphs computed by the RE pipeline together with the cytogenetic analysis might be a reliable approach for the determination of the hybrid or allopolyploid plant species parentage and may also be useful for detecting historical introgression events.	2020	10.3389/fpls.2020.00041		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Garg, Harsh; Banga, Shashi; Bansal, Payal; Atri, Chhaya; Banga, S. S.	Hybridizing Brassica rapa with wild crucifers Diplotaxis erucoides and Brassica maurorum	EUPHYTICA	Two wide hybrids, Diplotaxis erucoides (2n = 14) x Brassica rapo (2n = 20) and B. maurorum (2n = 20) x B. rapa, were developed using the sequential ovary-ovule culture. Reciprocal crosses failed, possibly as a consequence of strong unilateral incompatibility. The F-1 hybrids in each combination were completely male sterile and morphologically intermediate to the respective parents. DNA marker polymorphism and chromosome counts confirmed their hybrid nature. High frequency of bivalents in the F-1 and the presence of trivalents/quadrivalents in the derived amphiploids suggested genomic duplications and homoeology of the parental genomes. Up to three homoeologous pairs between the D. erucoides ((DDe)-D-e) and B. rapa (AA) genomes, and one between B. maurorum ((BBm)-B-m) and B. rapa genomes were observed. Successful synthesis of the F, hybrids and amphiploids of B. rapa with D. erucoides and B. maurorum, and allosyndetic chromosome pairing are expected to permit introgressions of desirable loci into the cultivated Brassica germplasm, especially for resistance to Alternaria brassicae and Albugo candida.	2007	10.1007/s10681-007-9391-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Gautam, Mayank; Dang, Yanwei; Ge, Xianhong; Shao, Yujiao; Li, Zaiyun	Genetic and Epigenetic Changes in Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus L.) Extracted from Intergeneric Allopolyploid and Additions with Orychophragmus	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Allopolyploidization with the merger of the genomes from different species has been shown to be associated with genetic and epigenetic changes. But the maintenance of such alterations related to one parental species after the genome is extracted from the allopolyploid remains to be detected. In this study, the genome of Brassica napus L. (2n = 38, genomes AACC) was extracted from its intergeneric allohexaploid (2n = 62, genomes AACCOO) with another crucifer Orychophragmus violaceus (2n = 24, genome OO), by backcrossing and development of alien addition lines. B. napus-type plants identified in the self-pollinated progenies of nine monosomic additions were analyzed by the methods of amplified fragment length polymorphism, sequence-specific amplified polymorphism, and methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism. They showed modifications to certain extents in genomic components (loss and gain of DNA segments and transposons, introgression of alien DNA segments) and DNA methylation, compared with B. napus donor. The significant differences in the changes between the B. napus types extracted from these additions likely resulted from the different effects of individual alien chromosomes. Particularly, the additions which harbored the O. violaceus chromosome carrying dominant rRNA genes over those of B. napus tended to result in the development of plants which showed fewer changes, suggesting a role of the expression levels of alien rRNA genes in genomic stability. These results provided new cues for the genetic alterations in one parental genome that are maintained even after the genome becomes independent.	2016	10.3389/fpls.2016.00438		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Gedil, Melaku; Kolade, Fisayo; Raji, Adebola; Ingelbrecht, Ivan; Dixon, Alfred	Development of molecular genomic tools for verification of intergeneric hybrids between castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT	Despite its relatively recent introduction to Africa, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) has become a major food crop adapted to a wide range of agro-ecologies that is grown by millions of small-holding farmers of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), owing to its remarkable tolerance to an array of biotic and abiotic stresses. Its economic importance is expected to grow further as evidenced by global consideration of cassava as an alternative source of renewable energy (biofuel) that prompted genome sequencing initiative of the crop. To address the evolving demand for new cultivars with unique traits such as high quality and quantity starch, high protein and high carotene content, breeders seek to broaden the genetic base of the breeding pool. Secondly, there is a dire need to develop alternative mapping populations such as doubled haploid (DH) to enhance the efficiency of molecular breeding. Towards these goals, we launched a project to cross cassava (Manihot esculenta) with castor bean (Ricinus communis L.). As a first step of validation of hybridization, different types of molecular markers (RAPD, AFLP, and SSR) were screened to distinguish cassava, castor and the putative hybrids at the DNA level. Only few of the RAPD and SSR primers screened showed that some hybrids might have combined alleles from both parents. Some of the primers revealed a castor-specific band that was absent in both cassava and the hybrid. In AFLP analysis, some primer combinations detected both castor and cassava specific bands in the hybrid. However, these data were not consistent with most hybrids and results are inconclusive. In the latest approach, we used bioinformatics tools to design a castor specific sequence tagged site (STS) primer. Preliminary results show that castor-specific STS primer pairs could not amplify products in the putative hybrids while cassava-specific primers amplify the products. Comparison of relative nuclear DNA content with flow cytometry showed that hybrids have similar DNA content with cassava suggesting that the tested genotypes may not be true hybrids. Further crossing and testing of hybrids, including reciprocals and a panel of cassava and castor clones will continue. The development of markers to verify such wide crosses, once confirmed by cytological analysis and morphological characterization, opens an opportunity to use DH mapping populations thereby accelerating the development of saturated linkage map in cassava, with the possibility of introgressing novel traits of commercial value from castor to cassava.	2009			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Ghazvini, Habibollah; Hiebert, Colin W.; Thomas, Julian B.; Fetch, Thomas	Development of a multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA) method used to locate a new stem rust resistance gene (Sr54) in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	An important aspect of studying putative new genes in wheat is determining their position on the wheat genetic map. The primary difficulty in mapping genes is determining which chromosome carries the gene of interest. Several approaches have been developed to address this problem, each with advantages and disadvantages. Here we describe a new approach called multiple bulked segregant analysis (MBSA). A set of 423 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected based on profile simplicity, frequency of polymorphism, and distribution across the wheat genome. SSR primers were preloaded in 384-well PCR plates with each primer occupying 16 wells. In practice, 14 wells are reserved for "mini-bulks" that are equivalent to four gametes (e.g. two F-2 individuals) comprised of individuals from a segregated population that have a known homozygous genotype for the gene of interest. The remaining two wells are reserved for the parents of the population. Each well containing a mini-bulk can have one of three allele compositions for each SSR: only the allele from one parent, only the allele from the other parent, or both alleles. Simulation experiments were performed to determine the pattern of mini-bulk allele composition that would indicate putative linkage between the SSR in question and the gene of interest. As a test case, MBSA was employed to locate an unidentified stem rust resistance (Sr) gene in the winter wheat cultivar Norin 40. A doubled haploid (DH) population (n = 267) was produced from hybrids of the cross LMPG-6S/Norin 40. The DH population segregated for a single gene (chi (1:1) (2) = 0.093, p = 0.76) for resistance to Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici race LCBN. Four resistant DH lines were included in each of the 14 mini-bulks for screening. The Sr gene was successfully located to the long arm of chromosome 2D using MBSA. Further mapping confirmed the chromosome location and revealed that the Sr gene was located in a linkage block that may represent an alien translocation. The new Sr gene was designated as Sr54.	2013	10.1007/s00122-012-1992-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ghesquiere, Marc; Humphreys, Mike; Zwierzykowski, Zbigniew	Festulolium Hybrids: Results, Limits and Prospects	SUSTAINABLE USE OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN FORAGE AND TURF BREEDING	Festulolium refers to natural or synthetic intergeneric hybrids between obligate outbreeding species of the Festuca (fescue) and Lolium (ryegrass) genera, species considered frequently as ideal components of agricultural or turf-grass systems. Festulolium provide specialist function and novel alternatives to existing grass cultivars that may lack resilience against abiotic or biotic stresses. So far, 23 amphiploid Festulolium cultivars have been registered onto national lists as well as 18 cultivars resulting from introgression either into tall fescue or into Italian and perennial ryegrass. Although dispersed throughout the world, Festulolium breeding has considerably stimulated research on genetics of the grasses. This has contributed to the development of numerous new technologies among which Genome In-Situ Hybridization has played an essential role for precision breeding, i.e. monitoring the transfer of selected traits from fescues into diploid Lolium sp. In the future, it would seem very likely that breeding amphiploid Festulolium will also benefit from the genomic advances achieved in diploids using introgression. As future Festulolium cultivars are expected to be extremely diverse, this will require that regulations for registration rely on a genome-based classification and suitable official tests for better acknowledgement of agronomic advances by end-users.	2010	10.1007/978-90-481-8706-5_74		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Patterns of Transmission Ratio Distortion in Interspecific Lettuce Hybrids Reveal a Sex-Independent Gametophytic Barrier	GENETICS	Interspecific crosses can result in progeny with reduced vitality or fertility due to genetic incompatibilities between species, a phenomenon known as hybrid incompatibility (HI). HI is often caused by a bias against deleterious allele combinations, which results in transmission ratio distortion (TRD). Here, we determined the genome-wide distribution of HI between wild lettuce, Lactuca saligna, and cultivated lettuce, L. sativa, in a set of backcross inbred lines (Bits) with single introgression segments from L. saligna introgressed into a L. sativa genetic background. Almost all Bits contained an introgression segment in a homozygous state except a few Bits, for which we were able to obtain only a single heterozygous introgression. Their inbred progenies displayed severe TRD with a bias toward the L. sativa allele and complete nontransmission of the homozygous L. saligna introgression, i.e., absolute HI. These HI might be caused by deleterious heterospecific allele combinations at two loci. We used an multilocus segregating interspecific F2 population to identify candidate conspecific loci that can nullify the HI in Bits. Segregation analysis of developed double-introgression progenies showed nullification of three HI and proved that these HI are explained by nuclear pairwise incompatibilities. One of these digenic HI showed 29% reduced seed set and its pattern of TRD pointed to a sex-independent gametophytic barrier. Namely, this HI was caused by complete nontransmission of one heterospecific allele combination at the haploid stage, surprisingly in both male and female gametophytes. Our study shows that two-locus incompatibility systems contribute to reproductive barriers among Lactuca species.	2019	10.1534/genetics.118.301566		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Girke, Andreas; Schierholt, Antje; Becker, Heiko C.	Extending the rapeseed genepool with resynthesized Brassica napus L. I: Genetic diversity	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	Resynthesized Brassica napus L. could be employed to increase the genetic variation in the narrow oilseed rape genepool and to establish a genetically distant genepool for hybrid breeding. One important criterion for selecting appropriate resynthesized lines is their genetic distance to adapted breeding material. In this study we estimated the genetic distances in a wide collection of 142 resynthesized lines and 57 winter and spring rapeseed cultivars from Europe, North America and Asia using RFLP marker data. The highest in-group genetic distance (0.36) was observed in 142 resynthesized lines compared to 0.21 in winter, 0.23 in summer, and 0.28 in Asian genotypes. The group of adapted breeding material clustered into three groups of winter-, spring-type, and Asian genotypes. Resynthesized lines did not form distinct subgroups in the cluster analysis, but large differences were revealed in the genetic distance of resynthesized lines to the adapted winter oilseed rape genepool. The highest distance to winter oilseed rape was found in resynthesized lines with parental lines from the Asian genepool as B. oleracea convar. botrytis var. alboglabra (Bail.) Sun or B. rapa ssp. chinensis (L.) Hanelt.	2012	10.1007/s10722-011-9772-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Gonzalo Gutierrez, Andres; James Carabali, Silvio; Ximena Giraldo, Olga; Pompilio Martinez, Cesar; Correa, Fernando; Prado, Gustavo; Tohme, Joe; Lorieux, Mathias	Identification of a Rice stripe necrosis virus resistance locus and yield component QTLs using Oryza sativa x O. glaberrima introgression lines	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Developing new population types based on interspecific introgressions has been suggested by several authors to facilitate the discovery of novel allelic sources for traits of agronomic importance. Chromosome segment substitution lines from interspecific crosses represent a powerful and useful genetic resource for QTL detection and breeding programs. Results: We built a set of 64 chromosome segment substitution lines carrying contiguous chromosomal segments of African rice Oryza glaberrima MG12 (acc. IRGC103544) in the genetic background of Oryza sativa ssp. tropical japonica (cv. Caiapo). Well-distributed simple-sequence repeats markers were used to characterize the introgression events. Average size of the substituted chromosomal segments in the substitution lines was about 10 cM and covered the whole donor genome, except for small regions on chromosome 2 and 4. Proportions of recurrent and donor genome in the substitution lines were 87.59% and 7.64%, respectively. The remaining 4.78% corresponded to heterozygotes and missing data. Strong segregation distortion was found on chromosomes 3 and 6, indicating the presence of interspecific sterility genes. To illustrate the advantages and the power of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection using substitution lines, a QTL detection was performed for scored traits. Transgressive segregation was observed for several traits measured in the population. Fourteen QTLs for plant height, tiller number per plant, panicle length, sterility percentage, 1000-grain weight and grain yield were located on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. Furthermore, a highly significant QTL controlling resistance to the Rice stripe necrosis virus was located between SSR markers RM202-RM26406 (44.5-44.8 cM) on chromosome 11. Conclusions: Development and phenotyping of CSSL libraries with entire genome coverage represents a useful strategy for QTL discovery. Mapping of the RSNV locus represents the first identification of a genetic factor underlying resistance to this virus. This population is a powerful breeding tool. It also helps in overcoming hybrid sterility barriers between species of rice.	2010	10.1186/1471-2229-10-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Gopalakrishnan, S.; Sharma, R. K.; Rajkumar, K. Anand; Joseph, M.; Singh, V. P.; Singh, A. K.; Bhat, K. V.; Singh, N. K.; Mohapatra, T. M.	Integrating marker assisted background analysis with foreground selection for identification of superior bacterial blight resistant recombinants in Basmati rice	PLANT BREEDING	Basmati rice is highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Transfer of BB resistance genes from non-Basmati sources to Basmati through cross-hybridization requires strict monitoring for recovery of the desirable Basmati quality traits in the recombinants, which show complex inheritance pattern. We integrated background analysis using mapped microsatellite markers with foreground selection to identify superior lines that combine useful genes from a non-Basmati BB resistance donor line IRBB55 with grain and cooking quality characteristics of the popular Basmati rice variety 'Pusa Basmati 1' (PB 1) employing backcross pedigree strategy. Foreground selection using linked markers ensured presence of two genes, xa13 and Xa21 for BB resistance from IRBB55, and the recurrent parent PB I allele for the waxy locus giving intermediate amylose content and maintainer allele at fertility restorer locus in the BC1F5 recombinants. Background analysis enabled selection of recombinants with recurrent parent genome to the extent of 86.3% along with the quality traits. The extent of introgression of non-Basmati donor chromosome segments in the superior selections was estimated to be < 7 8 Mb and < 6.7 Mb in the xa13 and Xa21 linked genomic regions, respectively. Association mapping identified three quantitative trait loci, one each for 1000-grain weight, fertile grains/panicle and cooked kernel length. The backcross-pedigree breeding strategy facilitated recovery of additional desirable characteristics from the donor in some of the selections. The elite selection Pusa 1460-01-32-6-7-67 with maximum genomic background and quality characteristics of the recurrent Basmati parent gave resistance reaction against BB, similar to that of the non-Basmati resistant check variety and recorded an yield advantage of 11.9% over the best check in the multiplication agronomic trial in the Basmati growing region of India. This line, which has been released as a new variety in the name of 'Improved Pusa Basmati 1' for commercial cultivation in India, is an example of successful application of marker assisted selection to variety development.	2008	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2007.01458.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gordeeva, E. I.; Leonova, I. N.; Kalinina, N. P.; Salina, E. A.; Budashkina, E. B.	Comparative cytological and molecular analysis of common wheat introgression lines containing genetic material of Triticum timopheevii Zhuk	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	A total of 40 introgression lines of common wheat (2 n = 42) Triticum aestivum L x T. timopheevii Zhuk., resistant to leaf rust and partly to powdery mildew, were examined. Based on cytological analysis of meiosis in pollen mother cells (PMC), hybrid lines were subdivided into two groups characterized by either stable or unstable meiosis. In cytologically stable lines, chromosome configuration at the MI stage of meiosis was mostly bivalent (21II) with small proportion of defect cells (almost 10%), which at most contained two univalents (20II + 2I). Cytologically unstable group was comprised of the lines, containing high proportions of cells with abnormal chromosome pairing in meiotic PMC, as well as the cells with multivalents, and the lines containing aneuploid plants. Localization of the T. timopheevii fragments performed with the use of SSR markers showed that the lines with unstable meiosis were characterized by higher numbers of introgressions compared to stable lines. The influence of certain chromosomes of T. timopheevii on chromosome pairing stability was also demonstrated. In cytologically unstable lines, the increased frequency of 2A substitutions along with the high frequency of introgression of T. timopheevii genetic material into chromosome 7A was observed. Multivalents were scored in all cases of introgression in chromosome 7A. It was suggested that the reason for the genome instability in hybrid forms lied in insufficient compensating ability of certain T. timopheevii chromosomes and/or their parts, involved into recombination processes.	2009	10.1134/S1022795409120047		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Linkage Map Construction and Quantitative Trait Locus Analysis of Agronomic and Fiber Quality Traits in Cotton	PLANT GENOME	The superior fiber properties of Gossypium barbadense L. serve as a source of novel variation for improving fiber quality in Upland cotton (G. hirsutum L.), but introgression from G. barbadense has been largely unsuccessful due to hybrid breakdown and a lack of genetic and genomic resources. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we constructed a linkage map and conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of 10 agronomic and fiber quality traits in a recombinant inbred mapping population derived from a cross between TM-1, an Upland cotton line, and NM24016, an elite G. hirsutum line with stabilized introgression from G. barbadense. The linkage map consisted of 429 simple-sequence repeat (SSR) and 412 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker loci that covered half of the tetraploid cotton genome. Notably, the 841 marker loci were unevenly distributed among the 26 chromosomes of tetraploid cotton. The 10 traits evaluated on the TM-1 x NM24016 population in a multienvironment trial were highly heritable, and most of the fiber traits showed considerable transgressive variation. Through the QTL analysis, we identified a total of 28 QTLs associated with the 10 traits. Our study provides a novel resource that can be used by breeders and geneticists for the genetic improvement of agronomic and fiber quality traits in Upland cotton.	2014	10.3835/plantgenome2013.07.0023		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gorjanc, Gregor; Jenko, Janez; Hearne, Sarah J.; Hickey, John M.	Initiating maize pre-breeding programs using genomic selection to harness polygenic variation from landrace populations	BMC GENOMICS	Background: The limited genetic diversity of elite maize germplasms raises concerns about the potential to breed for new challenges. Initiatives have been formed over the years to identify and utilize useful diversity from landraces to overcome this issue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proposed designs to initiate a pre-breeding program within the Seeds of Discovery (SeeD) initiative with emphasis on harnessing polygenic variation from landraces using genomic selection. We evaluated these designs with stochastic simulation to provide decision support about the effect of several design factors on the quality of resulting (pre-bridging) germplasm. The evaluated design factors were: i) the approach to initiate a pre-breeding program from the selected landraces, doubled haploids of the selected landraces, or testcrosses of the elite hybrid and selected landraces, ii) the genetic parameters of landraces and phenotypes, and iii) logistical factors related to the size and management of a pre-breeding program. Results: The results suggest a pre-breeding program should be initiated directly from landraces. Initiating from testcrosses leads to a rapid reconstruction of the elite donor genome during further improvement of the pre-bridging germplasm. The analysis of accuracy of genomic predictions across the various design factors indicate the power of genomic selection for pre-breeding programs with large genetic diversity and constrained resources for data recording. The joint effect of design factors was summarized with decision trees with easy to follow guidelines to optimize pre-breeding efforts of SeeD and similar initiatives. Conclusions: Results of this study provide guidelines for SeeD and similar initiatives on how to initiate pre-breeding programs that aim to harness polygenic variation from landraces.	2016	10.1186/s12864-015-2345-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Goswami, Rajat; Zunjare, Rajkumar Uttamrao; Khan, Suphiya; Baveja, Aanchal; Muthusamy, Vignesh; Hossain, Firoz	Marker-assisted introgression of rare allele of -carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1) gene into elite quality protein maize inbred for combining high lysine, tryptophan and provitamin A in maize	PLANT BREEDING	Vitamin A deficiency in humans is a widespread health problem. Quality protein maize (QPM) is a popular food rich in lysine and tryptophan, but poor in provitamin A (proA). Here, we report the improvement of an elite QPM inbred, HKI1128Q for proA using marker-assisted introgression of crtRB1-favourable allele. HKI1128 was one of the parental lines of three popular hybrids in India and was converted to QPM in our earlier programme. Severe segregation distortion for crtRB1 was observed in BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC2F2. Background selection by 100 SSRs revealed mean recovery of 91.07% recurrent parent genome varying from 88.78% to 93.88%. Across years, introgressed progenies possessed higher mean -carotene (BC: 9.22 mu g/g), -cryptoxanthin (BCX: 3.05 mu g/g) and provitamin A (proA: 10.75 mu g/g) compared to HKI1128Q (BC: 2.26 mu g/g, BCX: 2.26 mu g/g and proA: 3.38 mu g/g). High concentration of essential amino acids, viz. lysine (mean: 0.303%) and tryptophan (0.080%) in endosperm, was also retained. Multi-year evaluation showed that introgressed progenies possessed similar grain yield (1,759-1,879kg/ha) with HKI1128Q (1,778kg/ha). Introgressed progenies with higher lysine, tryptophan and proA hold immense potential as donors and parents in developing biofortified hybrids.	2019	10.1111/pbr.12676		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted breeding of Pi-1 and Piz-5 genes imparting resistance to rice blast in PRR78, restorer line of Pusa RH-10 Basmati rice hybrid	PLANT BREEDING	Rice blast, caused by fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is a serious disease causing considerable economic damage worldwide. Best way to overcome disease is to breed for disease-resistant cultivars/parental lines of hybrids. Pusa RH10, first aromatic, fine-grain rice hybrid released and cultivated extensively in India. Hybrid and its parental lines, Pusa 6A and PRR78, are highly susceptible to blast. CO39 pyramid carrying two dominant, broad-spectrum blast-resistance genes, viz. Pi-1 and Piz-5, used as a donor parent to introgress these genes into PRR78 using marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC). Microsatellite markers RM5926 and AP5659-5 tightly linked to Pi-1 and Piz-5 genes, respectively, were used for foreground selection to derive introgression lines. Further, these lines were evaluated for agronomic performance, disease reaction and cooking quality traits along with PRR78. Most of the improved lines were on par with PRR78 for all traits evaluated except gelatinization temperature. Recurrent parent genome percentage (RPG) study also revealed similarity of these lines with PRR78. Hybrids derived using improved PRR78 lines were superior over Pusa RH10 in terms of yield.	2013	10.1111/pbr.12017		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gouil, Quentin; Baulcombe, David C.	Paramutation-like features of multiple natural epialleles in tomato	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Freakish and rare or the tip of the iceberg? Both phrases have been used to refer to paramutation, an epigenetic drive that contravenes Mendel's first law of segregation. Although its underlying mechanisms are beginning to unravel, its understanding relies only on a few examples that may involve transgenes or artificially generated epialleles. Results: By using DNA methylation of introgression lines as an indication of past paramutation, we reveal that the paramutation-like properties of the H06 locus in hybrids of Solanum lycopersicum and a range of tomato relatives and cultivars depend on the timing of sRNA production and conform to an RNA-directed mechanism. In addition, by scanning the methylomes of tomato introgression lines for shared regions of differential methylation that are absent in the S. lycopersicum parent, we identify thousands of candidate regions for paramutation-like behaviour. The methylation patterns for a subset of these regions segregate with non Mendelian ratios, consistent with secondary paramutation-like interactions to variable extents depending on the locus. Conclusion: Together these results demonstrate that paramutation-like epigenetic interactions are common for natural epialleles in tomato, but vary in timing and penetrance.	2018	10.1186/s12864-018-4590-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gouy, M.; Luquet, D.; Rouan, L.; Martine, J. -F.; Thong-Chane, A.; Costet, L.; Nibouche, S.; Goze, E.	Site and Saccharum spontaneum introgression level drive sugarcane yield component traits and their impact on sucrose yield in contrasted radiation and thermal conditions in La Reunion	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH	Improving sucrose yield is one of the main objectives of sugarcane breeding. Splitting this complex trait into yield components should make this task easier, as each component may be influenced in its own way by environmental factors and by genetic background. Abiotic conditions experienced by sugarcane across its cropping areas differ in many respects; among them, water availability and photo-thermal conditions particularly affect sucrose yield formation. In this study, sucrose yield was divided into seven component traits and studied in a panel of 155 sugarcane accessions phenotyped at two sites under contrasting photo-thermal conditions: one in low altitude and the other in higher altitude. The accessions were hybrids developed during the last century and representing the worldwide cultivated genetic diversity. The proportion of Saccharum spontaneurn genome in the genome of each accession was estimated by analyzing the genetic structure of the panel associated with two outgroups formed by 19 S. spontaneum and 29 S. officinarum accessions genotyped with 419 DArT markers and using a Bayesian clustering method implemented in STRUCTURE software. A K = 2 number of clusters clearly separated S. spontaneum from S. officinarum, while the estimated proportions of the S. spontaneum genome in the genome of hybrid accessions ranged from 0.5 to 0. Multivariate mixed model of log transformed yield components was adjusted to estimate each component's contribution to sucrose yield genetic variance, taking into account interrelationships among components. Each component's contribution to sucrose yield variance was site-dependent. On the low altitude site with high photo-thermal conditions, stalk section was the main contributor to yield variance, while on the high altitude site with low photo-thermal conditions, stalk height was the main contributor. A linear regression showed that the estimated proportion of S. spontaneum genome in the hybrids' genome had significant effects on sucrose yield and its components. These effects also varied with the site: under low altitude conditions, the estimated proportion of S. spontaneum genome in the hybrid's genome exerted a significant negative effect on sucrose yield, whereas no significant effect was found under high altitude conditions. These results suggest that both efforts toward introgression and selection on yield components for sugarcane breeding purposes should depend on the targeted cropping environment.

Govindaraj, P.; Balamurugan, A.; Natarajan, U. S.	Identification of intergeneric hybrids between Erianthus arundinaceus and Saccharum spontaneum through STMS markers	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL	Erianthus arundinaceus, a genus in Saccharum complex with high biomass production and resistance to biotic stresses is one of the potential candidates to broaden the genetic base of modern sugarcane varieties. Except some advancements reported on Erianthus introgression in India and Australia, attempts in the past four decades did not result in significant progress due to the inherent difficulty in making such crosses, transmission of n+n gametes and hybrid sterility. Saccharum spontaneum was used as bridge species to overcome these barriers but identification of true intergeneric hybrids with morphological markers was difficult. Fifteen sugarcane genome specific STMS markers were successfully used in identifying four suspected hybrids between two S. spontaneum (SES 286 -SS1 and SES 571 -SS2) and one Erianthus arundinaceus (IK 76-92-EA). Among the 15 primers used, 13 and 12 were polymorphic between EA and SS1 and EA and SS2 respectively. The polymorphic markers ranged from 1 (NKS 12, 46) to 12 (NKS 21) among the progeny of EA x SS1 and 2 (NKS 45, 15, 38, 40) to 7 (NKS 23) among the progeny of EA x SS2. While the hybrid nature of three progeny of the cross EA x SS1 was confirmed by the distinct presence of 57, 53 and 56 male specific markers respectively, hybrid nature of the progeny between EA x SS2 was confirmed by the presence of 42 male specific markers. The study clearly demonstrated the efficiency of STMS markers to generate large polymorphism and identification of true hybrids.	2012			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Studies applying such probe sets have focused on testing the universality and performance of the target nuclear loci, but they have not taken advantage of off-target data from other genome compartments generated alongside the nuclear loci. Here we do so to infer phylogenetic relationships in the orchid genus Epidendrum and closely related genera of subtribe Laeliinae. Our aims are to: 1) test the technical viability of applying the plant anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) method (Angiosperm v.1 probe kit) to our focal group, 2) mine plastid protein coding genes from off-target reads; and 3) evaluate the performance of the target nuclear and off-target plastid loci in resolving and supporting phylogenetic relationships along a range of taxonomical depths. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from the nuclear data set through coalescent summary and site-based methods, whereas plastid loci were analyzed in a concatenated partitioned matrix under maximum likelihood. The usefulness of target and flanking non-target nuclear regions and plastid loci was assessed through the estimation of their phylogenetic informativeness. Our study successfully applied the plant AHE probe kit to Epidendrum, supporting the universality of this kit in angiosperms. Moreover, it demonstrated the feasibility of mining plastome loci from off-target reads generated with the Angiosperm v.1 probe kit to obtain additional, uniparentally inherited sequence data at no extra sequencing cost. Our analyses detected some strongly supported incongruences between nuclear and plastid data sets at shallow divergences, an indication of potential lineage sorting, hybridization, or introgression events in the group. Lastly, we found that the per site phylogenetic informativeness of the ycf1 plastid gene surpasses that of all other plastid genes and several nuclear loci, making it an excellent candidate for assessing phylogenetic relationships at medium to low taxonomic levels in orchids.	2020	10.3389/fpls.2019.01761		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	*introgression was not explicitly measured	FALSE			FALSE

New genetic variation is currently being introduced into wheat through introgressions from its wild relatives. For trait discovery, it is necessary that each introgression is homozygous and hence stable. Breeding programmes rely on efficient genotyping platforms for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Recently, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based markers have been made available on high-throughput Axiom (R) SNP genotyping arrays. However, these arrays are inflexible in their design and sample numbers, making their use unsuitable for long-term MAS. SNPs can potentially be converted into Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP (TM)) assays that are comparatively cost-effective and efficient for low-density genotyping of introgression lines. However, due to the polyploid nature of wheat, KASP assays for homoeologous SNPs can have difficulty in distinguishing between heterozygous and homozygous hybrid lines in a backcross population. To identify co-dominant SNPs, that can differentiate between heterozygotes and homozygotes, we PCR-amplified and sequenced genomic DNA from potential single-copy regions of the wheat genome and compared them to orthologous copies from different wild relatives. A panel of 620 chromosome-specific KASP assays have been developed that allow rapid detection of wild relative segments and provide information on their homozygosity and site of introgression in the wheat genome. A set of 90 chromosome-nonspecific assays was also produced that can be used for genotyping introgression lines. These multipurpose KASP assays represent a powerful tool for wheat breeders worldwide.	2020	10.1111/pbi.13241		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Grewal, Surbhi; Hubbart-Edwards, Stella; Yang, Caiyun; Scholefield, Duncan; Ashling, Stephen; Burridge, Amanda; Wilkinson, Paul Anthony; King, Ian P.; King, Julie	Detection of T. urartu Introgressions in Wheat and Development of a Panel of Interspecific Introgression Lines	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Tritcum urartu (2n = 2x = 14, A(u)A(u)), the A genome donor of wheat, is an important source for new genetic variation for wheat improvement due to its high photosynthetic rate and disease resistance. By facilitating the generation of genome-wide introgressions leading to a variety of different wheat-T. urartu translocation lines, T. urartu can be practically utilized in wheat improvement. Previous studies that have generated such introgression lines have been unable to successfully use cytological methods to detect the presence of T. urartu in these lines. Many have, thus, used a variety of molecular markers with limited success due to the low-density coverage of these markers and time-consuming nature of the techniques rendering them unsuitable for large-scale breeding programs. In this study, we report the generation of a resource of single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers, present on a high-throughput SNP genotyping array, that can detect the presence of T. urartu in a hexaploid wheat background making it a potentially valuable tool in wheat pre-breeding programs. A whole genome introgression approach has resulted in the transfer of different chromosome segments from T. urartu into wheat which have then been detected and characterized using these SNP markers. The molecular analysis of these wheat- T. urartu recombinant lines has resulted in the generation of a genetic map of T. urartu containing 368 SNP markers, spread across all seven chromosomes of T. urartu. Comparative analysis of the genetic map of T. urartu and the physical map of the hexaploid wheat genome showed that synteny between the two species is highly conserved at the macro-level and confirmed the presence of the 4/5 translocation in T. urartu also present in the A genome of wheat. A panel of 17 wheat- T. urartu recombinant lines, which consisted of introgressed segments that covered the whole genome of T. urartu, were also selected for selffertilization to provide a germplasm resource for future trait analysis. This valuable resource of high-density molecular markers specifically designed for detecting wild relative chromosomes and a panel of stable interspecific introgression lines will greatly enhance the efficiency of wheat improvement through wild relative introgressions.	2018	10.3389/fpls.2018.01565		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Grosser, Jude W.; Chandler, J. L.; Duncan, Larry W.	Production of mandarin plus pummelo somatic hybrid citrus rootstocks with potential for improved tolerance/resistance to sting nematode	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	Sting nematode (Belonolaimus longicaudatus Rau) has become a primary factor limiting citrus production in localized regions of the central Florida sandridge citrus production area, making the development of resistant rootstocks a new breeding objective. In efforts to develop a replacement rootstock for the widely adapted sour orange, our focus has been on somatic hybridization of selected mandarin + pummelo combinations [Grosser, J.W., Gmitter, Jr., F.G., 1990. Protoplast fusion and citrus improvement. Plant Breed. Rev. 8, 339-374; Ananthakrishnan, G., Calovic, M., Serrano, P., Grosser, J.W., 2006. Production of additional allotetraploid somatic hybrids combining mandarins and sweet oranges with pre-selected pummelos as potential candidates to replace sour orange rootstock. In Vitro Cell. Dev.: Plant 42, 367-371], since sour orange is probably an introgression hybrid of mandarin and pummelo as suggested by molecular marker analyses [Nicolosi, E., Deng, Z.N., Gentile, A., La Malfa. S., Tribulato, E., 2000. Citrus phylogeny and genetic origin of important species as investigated by molecular markers. Theor. Appl. Genet. 100. 1155-1166-, Gulsen, O., Roose, M.L., 2001. Lemons: diversity and relationships with selected Citrus genotypes as measured with nuclear genome markers. J. Am. Soc. Hort. Sci. 126, 309-317]. Somatic hybrid plants were produced from four new mandarin (C reticulata Blanco) + pummelo (C. grandis L. Osbeck) parental combinations by fusing embryogenic suspension culture-derived protoplasts isolated from selected mandarins with leaf protoplasts of pummelo seedlings previously selected for tolerance/resi stance to the sting nematode (B. longicaudatus Rau) as follows: Amblycarpa mandarin + 'Liang Ping Yau' (seedling) pummelo seedling SN7; Amblycarpa mandarin + 'Hirado Buntan Pink' (HBP) pummelo seedling SN3; Murcott tangor + pummelo seedling SN3; and Shekwasha mandarin + pummelo seedling SN3. Somatic hybridization was verified by ploidy analysis (via flow cytometry) and RAPD analyses. Mandarin parents were selected for wide soil-adaptation and ability to produce friable embryogenic callus lines. Pummelo seedlings used as leaf parents were identified from a previous screen of large seed populations (200 each) from four pummelos for resistance to sting nematode as follows: 'Hirado Buntan Pink'; 'Red Shaddock'; 'Large Pink Pummelo' and a seedling pummelo of 'Liang Ping Yau'. Ten resistant/tolerant pummelo seedlings were selected from the 800 pummelo seeds planted in the screen for further study. The four new somatic hybrids have been propagated to evaluate their horticultural performance and resistance to the sting nematode. These potential somatic hybrid rootstocks should also have potential to control tree size due to polyploidy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Guerrero, Rafael F.; Posto, Amanda L.; Moyle, Leonie C.; Hahn, Matthew W.	Genome-wide patterns of regulatory divergence revealed by introgression lines	EVOLUTION	Understanding the genetic basis for changes in transcriptional regulation is an important aspect of understanding phenotypic evolution. Using interspecific introgression lines, we infer the mechanisms of divergence in genome-wide patterns of gene expression between the nightshades Solanum pennellii and S. lycopersicum (domesticated tomato). We find that cis- and trans-regulatory changes have had qualitatively similar contributions to divergence in this clade, unlike results from other systems. Additionally, expression data from four tissues (shoot apex, ripe fruit, pollen, and seed) suggest that introgressed regions in these hybrid lines tend to be downregulated, while background (nonintrogressed) genes tend to be upregulated. Finally, we find no evidence for an association between the magnitude of differential expression in NILs and previously determined sterility phenotypes. Our results contradict previous predictions of the predominant role of cis-over trans-regulatory divergence between species, and do not support a major role for gross genome-wide misregulation in reproductive isolation between these species.	2016	10.1111/evo.12875		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Guo SiBin; Qin FaLan; Zhang DuanPin; Lin XingHua	Characterization of interspecific hybrids and backcross progenies from a cross between Oryza minuta and Oryza sativa	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES C-LIFE SCIENCES	Oryza minuta, a tetraploid wild relative of cultivated rice, is an important source for the genetic improvement. Interspecific hybrids were obtained from the cross of O. sativa L. (IR24) and O. minuta (Acc. No. 101133) with 5.58% crossability, which ranged from 0.11% to 1.62% in the backcross generations. The chromosome numbers of the backcross progenies were 24 to 48. Seven yield-related traits of the parents, hybrid F-1, and backcross progenies were evaluated. Simple sequence repeat markers analysis showed that the polymorphism ratio of SSR bands between IR24 and Acc. No. 101133 was 93.2%. The average donor segment number, length, donor genome size, and percentage of donor genome of 92 BC3F1 plants (2n=24) were 24.1, 17.8 cM, 438.4 cM and 26.2%, respectively. They were complex variation and uneven among the chromosomes. These introgression lines could be used to identify the favorable genes of O. minuta and provide a new platform for the genetic improvement of cultivated rice.	2009	10.1007/s11427-008-0155-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE

TM-1 as the recipient parent and G. barbadense Hai7124 as the donor parent were used to explore the genetic basis of heterosis for interspecific hybrids. Two sets of F-1 populations individually derived from CSILs crossing with both parents were configured to investigate heterotic loci (HL) and substitution effect loci (SL). A total of 58 HL and 39 SL were identified in 3 years. One stable HL, hLP-A4-3, could be detected in all 3 years. Three HLs, hBS-A8-1, hLP-D6-1, and hSI-D7-11, could be detected in 2 years. Four SLs, sBS-D7-1, sLP-A8-1, sLP-D7-1, and sLP-D12-1, could be detected in 2 years. HL and SL tended to be distributed in some HL-rich chromosome segments with close positions. Compared with QTL detected in a former study, HL showed little overlap with QTL, indicating that trait phenotype and heterosis might be controlled by different sets of loci. All three forms of genetic effects (partial-, full-, over-dominant) were identified, while the over-dominant effect made the main contribution to heterosis. These results may help lay the foundation for clarifying the heredity mechanism of heterosis in cotton.	2013	10.1111/jipb.12054		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gupta, Hari S.; Raman, Babu; Agrawal, Pawan K.; Mahajan, Vinay; Hossain, Firoz; Thirunavukkarasu, Nepolean	Accelerated development of quality protein maize hybrid through marker-assisted introgression of opaque-2 allele	PLANT BREEDING	Vivek Maize Hybrid 9- a popular single-cross hybrid developed by crossing CM 212 and CM 145 was released for commercial cultivation in India. The parental lines, being deficient in lysine and tryptophan, were selected for introgression of opaque-2 allele using CML 180 and CML 170 as donor lines through marker-assisted backcross breeding. The opaque-2 homozygous recessive genotypes with >90% recovery of the recurrent parent genome were selected in BC2F2, and the seeds with <25% opaqueness in BC2F3 were forwarded for seed multiplication. Vivek Quality Protein Maize (QPM) 9, the improved QPM hybrid, showed 41% increase in tryptophan and 30% increase in lysine over the original hybrid. The grain yield of the improved hybrid was on par with the original hybrid. The newly improved QPM maize hybrid released in 2008 will help in reducing the protein malnutrition because its biological value is superior over the normal maize hybrids. This short duration QPM maize hybrid has been adopted in several hill states of North Western and North Eastern Himalayan regions.	2013	10.1111/pbr.12009		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Gupta, Mehak; Mason, Annaliese S.; Batley, Jacqueline; Bharti, Sakshi; Banga, Shashi; Banga, Surinder S.	Molecular-cytogenetic characterization of C-genome chromosome substitution lines in Brassica juncea (L.) Czern and Coss.	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	C genome chromosome substitution lines of B. juncea constitute a key genetic resource for increased genetic diversity and hybrid performance. C genome chromosome substitution lines were found in the progenies of derived B. juncea (2n = 36; AABB), synthesized through hybridization between B. napus and B. carinata. These were originally recognized based on the morphology and genomic in situ hybridization. Genotyping using the Brassica Illumina 60K Infinium SNP array confirmed the presence of C genome chromosomes in a large number of derived B. juncea genotypes. Three whole chromosome substitutions and 13 major C genome fragment substitutions were identified. Fragment substitutions were primarily terminal, but intercalary substitution(s) involving chromosome C1 and C2 were identified in three genotypes. The size of substituted C genome fragments varied from 0.04 Mbp (C1) to 64.85 Mbp (C3). In terms of proportions, these ranged from 0.10 % (C1) to 100 % (C1, C3 and C7) of the substituted chromosome. SSR genotyping with B genome specific primers suggested that substituting C genome chromosome(s) are likely to have replaced B genome chromosome(s). C1 was the most common substituting chromosome while substituted B chromosome seemed random. Study of the phenotypic traits underlined the importance of the substitution lines (especially of chromosome C1) for conferring superior trait performance (main shoot length and pods on the main shoot). High heterosis was also indicated in hybrid combinations of substitution lines with natural B. juncea. These substitution genotypes constituted a valuable resource for targeted gene transfer and QTL identification.	2016	10.1007/s00122-016-2692-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Hackauf, Bernd; Korzun, Viktor; Wortmann, Heinrich; Wilde, Peer; Wehling, Peter	Development of conserved ortholog set markers linked to the restorer gene Rfp1 in rye	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Restoration of male fertility is a prerequisite for hybrid rye breeding and currently the most straightforward approach to minimize ergot infection in hybrid rye varieties. Molecular markers are important tools for the efficient introgression and management of restorer genes like Rfp1 originating from unadapted genetic resources. Furthermore, closely linked markers flanking Rfp1 are indispensible for identifying and selecting individuals with haplotypes showing recombination between Rfp1 and other gene(s) that reside in close proximity and have a negative influence on yield. We identified orthologous gene sets in rice, Brachypodium, and Sorghum and used these gene models as templates to establish conserved ortholog set (COS) markers for the restorer gene Rfp1 on the long arm of rye chromosome 4R. The novel co-dominant markers delimit Rfp1 within a 0.7-cM interval and allow prediction of Rfp1 genotypes with a precision not feasible before. The COS markers enabled an alignment of the improved genetic map of rye chromosome 4R with wheat and barley maps and allowed identification of regions orthologous to Rfp1 in wheat and barley on the short arms of chromosomes 6D and 6H, respectively. Results obtained in this study revealed that micro-collinearity around the Rfp1 locus in rye is affected by rearrangements relative to other grass genomes. The impact of the novel COS markers for practical hybrid rye breeding is discussed.	2012	10.1007/s11032-012-9736-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Marker dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Hall, MC; Willis, JH	Transmission ratio distortion in intraspecific hybrids of Mimulus guttatus: Implications for genomic divergence	GENETICS	We constructed a genetic linkage map between two divergent populations of Mimulus guttatus. We genotyped an F-2 mapping population (N = 539) at 154 AFLP, microsatellite, and gene-based markers. A framework map was constructed consisting of 112 marker loci on 14 linkage groups with a total map length of 1518 cM Kosambi. Nearly half of all markers (48%) exhibited significant transmission ratio distortion (alpha = 0.05). By using a Bayesian multipoint mapping method and visual inspection of significantly distorted markers, we detected 12 transmission ratio distorting loci (TRDL) throughout the genome. The high degree of segregation distortion detected in this intraspecific map indicates substantial genomic divergence that perhaps suggests genomic incompatibilities between these two populations. We compare the pattern of transmission ratio distortion in this map to an interspecific map constructed between M. guttatus and M. nasutus. A similar level of segregation distortion is detected in both maps. Collinear regions between maps are compared to determine if there are shared genetic patterns of non-Mendelian segregation distortion within and among Mimulus species.	2005	10.1534/genetics.104.038653		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Hamzeh, Mona; Sawchyn, Christina; Perinet, Pierre; Dayanandan, Selvadurai	Asymmetrical natural hybridization between Populus deltoides and P. balsamifera (Salicaceae)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE	Natural hybridization has long been recognized as a means for gene flow between species and has important evolutionary consequences. Although hybridization is generally considered to be symmetrical, with both hybridizing species being equally likely to be the male or female parent, several studies have demonstrated the presence of asymmetrical hybridization and introgression from one species to the other. We investigated the direction of natural hybridization between two sympatric forest tree species in North America (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh. and Populus balsamifera L.) using species-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes. All natural hybrid individuals, identified from morphological traits, had nuclear alleles corresponding to both parental species, while the chloroplast genotypes showed similarity to P. deltoides, indicating asymmetrical hybridization with P. deltoides as the maternal and P. balsamifera as the paternal donor species. This observed asymmetrical hybridization may be attributable to cytonuclear interactions.	2007	10.1139/B07-105		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Gaertn. (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP), a wild relative of wheat, could provide many desirable genes for wheat improvement. Microdissection and degenerate oligonucleotide primed -polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) is an effective way to isolate specific sequences. The development of specific sequences and functional markers of P genome could lay the foundation for gene mapping and cloning. In this study, chromosomes 6PS and 6PL were microdissected from wheat-A. cristatum 6PS and 6PL addition lines, and DOP-PCR products from both microdissected chromosomes were used as probes to hybridize with mitotic metaphase chromosomes of diploid A. cristatum, wheat-A. cristatum addition lines 6PS, 6PL, and 6P. The results showed that the distribution patterns on A. cristatum chromosomes using DOP-PCR products of microdissected 6PS as the probe were similar to those using DOP-PCR products of microdissected 6PL as the probe. They both distributed along all chromosomes, and chromosome 6P and other chromosomes were similar according to the hybridization pattern. There were no signals on wheat chromosomes indicating that DOP-PCR products contain P-genome specific sequences. Actually, we obtained a P-genome specific sequence from the DOP-PCR products of 6PS, which could be used as a fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe to identify P genome chromatin in wheat-A. cristatum introgression lines. These results could provide a basis for the study of structure and evolution of P genome chromosomes. Furthermore, this study may lead to mapping and cloning of the desirable genes on 6P chromosome.	2015	10.2135/cropsci2015.03.0183		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Hancock, Wesley G.; Lewis, Ramsey S.	Heterosis, transmission genetics, and selection for increased growth rate in a N. tabacum x synthetic tobacco cross	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a classic amphidiploid, and hybrids between this cultivated species and closely related diploid Nicotiana relatives often exhibit heterotic effects for growth rate and yield. Crosses between N. tabacum and synthetic tobaccos, 4x(Nicotiana sylvestris x Nicotiana otophora) or 4x(N. sylvestris x Nicotiana tomentosiformis), may provide superior routes for genome-wide introgression from diploid relatives and allow increased potential to capitalize on heterotic effects in tobacco. Significant levels of mid-parent heterosis were observed for yield and growth rate in F-1 hybrids between synthetic tobaccos and a standard tobacco cultivar. Microsatellitemarker genotyping of an F-2 population derived from a K326 x [4x(N. sylvestris x N. otophora)] cross was carried out to preliminarily investigate the relative importance of different types of gene action on observed heterosis in the original interspecific cross. Results suggested a role for both partial dominance and overdominance. Marker genotyping also indicated an overall reduced level of recombination in the N. tabacum x synthetic tobacco cross relative to a N. tabacum x N. tabacum cross but no evidence of genomic regions with severely restricted levels of recombination. Results suggest that populations derived from N. tabacum x synthetic tobacco crosses may be more efficient for introgressing germplasm from diploid relatives, as compared to populations derived from crosses between N. tabacum and diploid forms where preferential pairing between N. tabacum homologues can reduce the potential for introgression of alien chromatin. Such materials may be useful as sources of favorable alleles influencing quantitative characters in tobacco.	2017	10.1007/s11032-017-0654-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Thomas	Introgression Analysis and Morphological Characterization of an Arachis hypogaea x A. diogoi Interspecific Hybrid Derived Population	CROP SCIENCE	Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an economically important crop grown around the world. Compared with the entire Arachis genus, cultivated peanut germplasm has low levels of genetic diversity for several economically important traits, resulting in the need for alternative sources of favorable alleles. Wild diploid species of Arachis are a source of such alleles to improve cultivated peanut for many economically important traits. An A. hypogaea x A. diogoi Hoehne introgression population was produced via the triploid-hexaploid method; the fourth generation after tetraploidy was used to initiate this study. The introgression lines were genotyped using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker array to estimate the percentage of A. diogoi chromatin introgression. Morphologically, the introgression lines varied for an array of measured traits, with the majority being intermediate to the two parents. The average amount of A. diogoi genome introgressed was 8.12% across the tetraploid genome and ranged from 3.00 to 18.14% on individual chromosomes. The average A. diogoi introgression across all lines was 7.70% and ranged from 0.17 to 51.12%. Principal component analysis of morphological data and SNP markers revealed similarities and groupings of introgression lines. This introgression population demonstrates the potential of using wild diploid Arachis species for peanut improvement and has great potential for use in cultivated peanut breeding programs.	2019	10.2135/cropsci2018.07.0461		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Hanusova, Kristyna; Ekrt, Libor; Vit, Petr; Kolar, Filip; Urfus, Tomas	Continuous Morphological Variation Correlated with Genome Size Indicates Frequent Introgressive Hybridization among Diphasiastrum Species (Lycopodiaceae) in Central Europe	PLOS ONE	Introgressive hybridization is an important evolutionary process frequently contributing to diversification and speciation of angiosperms. Its extent in other groups of land plants has only rarely been studied, however. We therefore examined the levels of introgression in the genus Diphasiastrum, a taxonomically challenging group of Lycopodiophytes, using flow cytometry and numerical and geometric morphometric analyses. Patterns of morphological and cytological variation were evaluated in an extensive dataset of 561 individuals from 57 populations of six taxa from Central Europe, the region with the largest known taxonomic complexity. In addition, genome size values of 63 individuals from Northern Europe were acquired for comparative purposes. Within Central European populations, we detected a continuous pattern in both morphological variation and genome size (strongly correlated together) suggesting extensive levels of interspecific gene flow within this region, including several large hybrid swarm populations. The secondary character of habitats of Central European hybrid swarm populations suggests that man-made landscape changes might have enhanced unnatural contact of species, resulting in extensive hybridization within this area. On the contrary, a distinct pattern of genome size variation among individuals from other parts of Europe indicates that pure populations prevail outside Central Europe. All in all, introgressive hybridization among Diphasiastrum species in Central Europe represents a unique case of extensive interspecific gene flow among spore producing vascular plants that cause serious complications of taxa delimitation.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0099552		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression based on morphology	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted introgression of bacterial blight and blast resistance into IR 58025B, an elite maintainer line of rice	PLANT BREEDING	IR 58025A is a very popular wild-abortive cytoplasmic male sterile (WA-CMS) line of rice and is extensively used for hybrid rice breeding. However, IR 58025A and many hybrids derived from it possess mild aroma (undesirable in some parts of India) and are highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) and blast diseases. To improve IR 58025A for BB and blast resistance, we have introgressed a major dominant gene conferring resistance against BB (i.e. Xa21) and blast (i.e. Pi54) into IR 58025B, the maintainer line of IR 58025A. An introgression line of Samba Mahsuri (i.e. SM2154) possessing Xa21 and Pi54 genes in homozygous condition and fine-grain type was used as donor parent, and backcross breeding strategy was adopted for targeted introgression of the resistance genes. PCR-based molecular markers tightly linked to Xa21 and Pi54 were used for selection of BB- and blast-resistant lines, while closely linked markers were used for identification of backcross-derived plants devoid of Rf4 and aroma. At BC2F5, four backcross-derived lines possessing resistance against BB and blast, devoid of aroma, high yield, short plant stature, long-slender grain type and with recurrent parent genome recovery ranging from 88.8% to 98.6% were selected and advanced for further evaluation. The improved versions of IR 58025B, viz. SB54-11-143-9-44-5, SB54-11-143-9-44-98, SB54-11-143-9-44-111 and SB54-11-143-9-44-171, behaved as perfect maintainers when test-crossed with WA-CMS lines. Agronomically superior lines of improved IR 58025B are being converted to CMS line through backcrossing for developing high-yielding and biotic stress-resistant rice hybrids.	2013	10.1111/pbr.12056		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Haritha, G.; Vishnukiran, T.; Yugandhar, P.; Sarla, N.; Subrahmanyam, D.	Introgressions from Oryza rufipogon Increase Photosynthetic Efficiency of KMR3 Rice Lines	RICE SCIENCE	To understand the wild Oryza genome effect on photosynthesis and its relation to total dry matter accumulation in an elite rice variety, a set of 40 stable introgression lines (ILs) BC3F8 derived from a cross of Oryza sativa (KMR3) x Oryza rufipogon (WR120) were grown under well watered conditions. Leaf gas exchange measurements and leaf chlorophyll estimates were conducted at the flowering stage. The results revealed significant variations in net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (E), transpiration efficiency (Pn/E) and carboxylation efficiency (Pn/C-i). Pn showed significant positive correlation with E, stomatal conductance (gs), Pn/C-i and total canopy dry matter. Specific leaf area and leaf thickness were not significantly correlated with Pn. Thirty-seven out of 40 ILs showed higher Pn than KMR3 [11.28 mu mol/(m(2)center dot s)], and 20 ILs showed higher Pn than WR120 [15.08 mu mol/(m(2)center dot s)]. The line IL194 showed the highest Pn [21.62 mu mol/(m(2)center dot s)] with increased total canopy dry matter followed by lines IL381, IL106, IL363-12, IL198, IL86-18 and IL50, which exhibited Pn above 18.0 mu mol/(m(2)center dot s). The ILs with enhanced Pn are a potential source for developing rice varieties and hybrids with higher biomass and yield.	2017	10.1016/j.rsci.2016.07.006		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Abiotic stress QTL in lettuce crop-wild hybrids: comparing greenhouse and field experiments	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	The development of stress-tolerant crops is an increasingly important goal of current crop breeding. A higher abiotic stress tolerance could increase the probability of introgression of genes from crops to wild relatives. This is particularly relevant to the discussion on the risks of new GM crops that may be engineered to increase abiotic stress resistance. We investigated abiotic stress QTL in greenhouse and field experiments in which we subjected recombinant inbred lines from a cross between cultivated Lactuca sativa cv. Salinas and its wild relative L. serriola to drought, low nutrients, salt stress, and aboveground competition. Aboveground biomass at the end of the rosette stage was used as a proxy for the performance of plants under a particular stress. We detected a mosaic of abiotic stress QTL over the entire genome with little overlap between QTL from different stresses. The two QTL clusters that were identified reflected general growth rather than specific stress responses and colocated with clusters found in earlier studies for leaf shape and flowering time. Genetic correlations across treatments were often higher among different stress treatments within the same experiment (greenhouse or field), than among the same type of stress applied in different experiments. Moreover, the effects of the field stress treatments were more correlated with those of the greenhouse competition treatments than to those of the other greenhouse stress experiments, suggesting that competition rather than abiotic stress is a major factor in the field. In conclusion, the introgression risk of stress tolerance (trans-) genes under field conditions cannot easily be predicted based on genomic background selection patterns from controlled QTL experiments in greenhouses, especially field data will be needed to assess potential (negative) ecological effects of introgression of these transgenes into wild relatives.	2014	10.1002/ece3.1060		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Hasan, M.; Friedt, W.; Pons-Kuehnemann, J.; Freitag, N. M.; Link, K.; Snowdon, R. J.	Association of gene-linked SSR markers to seed glucosinolate content in oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. napus)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Breeding of oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. napus) has evoked a strong bottleneck selection towards double-low (00) seed quality with zero erucic acid and low seed glucosinolate content. The resulting reduction of genetic variability in elite 00-quality oilseed rape is particularly relevant with regard to the development of genetically diverse heterotic pools for hybrid breeding. In contrast, B. napus genotypes containing high levels of erucic acid and seed glucosinolates (++ quality) represent a comparatively genetically divergent source of germplasm. Seed glucosinolate content is a complex quantitative trait, however, meaning that the introgression of novel germplasm from this gene pool requires recurrent backcrossing to avoid linkage drag for high glucosinolate content. Molecular markers for key low-glucosinolate alleles could potentially improve the selection process. The aim of this study was to identify potentially gene-linked markers for important seed glucosinolate loci via structure-based allele-trait association studies in genetically diverse B. napus genotypes. The analyses included a set of new simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers whose orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana are physically closely linked to promising candidate genes for glucosinolate biosynthesis. We found evidence that four genes involved in the biosynthesis of indole, aliphatic and aromatic glucosinolates might be associated with known quantitative trait loci for total seed glucosinolate content in B. napus. Markers linked to homoeologous loci of these genes in the paleopolyploid B. napus genome were found to be associated with a significant effect on the seed glucosinolate content. This example shows the potential of Arabidopsis-Brassica comparative genome analysis for synteny-based identification of gene-linked SSR markers that can potentially be used in marker-assisted selection for an important trait in oilseed rape.	2008	10.1007/s00122-008-0733-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

An elite, early-maturing, high-yielding Malaysian rice variety, MR263, is susceptible to blast and was used as the recurrent parent in this study. To improve MR263 disease resistance, the Pongsu Seribu 1 rice variety was used as donor of the blast resistance Pi-7(t), Pi-d(t)1 and Pir2-3(t) genes and qLN2 quantitative trait locus (QTL). The objective was to introgress these blast resistance genes into the background of MR263 using marker-assisted backcrossing with both foreground and background selection. RESULTSImproved MR263-BR-3-2, MR263-BR-4-3, MR263-BR-13-1 and MR263-BR-26-4 lines carrying the Pi-7(t), Pi-d(t)1 and Pir2-3(t) genes and qLN2QTL were developed using the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers RM5961 and RM263 (linked to the blast resistance genes and QTL) for foreground selection and a collection of 65 polymorphic SSR markers for background selection in backcrossed and selfed generations. A background analysis revealed that the highest rate of recurrent parent genome recovery was 96.1% in MR263-BR-4-3 and 94.3% in MR263-BR-3-2. CONCLUSIONThe addition of blast resistance genes can be used to improve several Malaysian rice varieties to combat this major disease.

He, Fang; Wang, Yuhai; Bao, Yinguang; Ma, Yingxue; Wang, Xin; Li, Xingfeng; Wang, Honggang	Chromosomal constitutions of five wheat - Elytrigia elongata partial amphiploids as revealed by GISH, multicolor GISH and FISH	COMPARATIVE CYTOGENETICS	A combination of meiotic pairing analysis and in situ hybridization (genomic in situ hybridization [GISH], multicolor GISH [mcGISH] and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) of five Triticum aestivum (Linnaeus, 1753) - Elytrigia elongata (Podpera, 1902) (2n = 10x = 70) amphiploids was employed to investigate the genomic constitution and relationships between wheat and alien chromosomes. GISH, multicolor GISH and FISH patterns of mitotic chromosomes indicate that the genomic constitution of the five partial amphiploids (XY693, XY7430, SN19, SN20 and SN122) are 14A + 12B + 14D + 8Js + 8J, 12A + 16B + 14D + 2St + 8Js + 2J + 2 W-E, 14A + 14B + 14D + 4St + 8Js, 14A + 14B + 14D + 2St + 10Js + 2J, and 14A + 14B + 14D + 2St + 8Js + 4J, respectively. Analysis of meiotic chromosome pairing in the F-1 hybrids between these five partial amphiploids suggests that SN20 and SN122 are the most closely related amphiploids and are somewhat related with XY693 and XY7430. However, the alien chromosome constitutions of SN19 differed from the other four amphiploids. In addition, a new pairing between wheat and E. elongata chromosomes was distinguished in some cells of the hybrids SN19 x XY7430, SN20 x XY7430 and SN122 x XY7430.	2017	10.3897/CompCytogen.v11i3.11883		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Herrera, Juan Carlos; D'Hont, Angelique; Lashermes, Philippe	Use of fluorescence in situ hybridization as a tool for introgression analysis and chromosome identification in coffee (Coffea arabica L.)	GENOME	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to study the presence of alien chromatin in interspecific hybrids and one introgressed line (S.288) derived from crosses between the cultivated species Coffea arabica and the diploid relatives C canephora and C. liberica. In situ hybridization using genomic DNA from C. canephora and C. arabica as probes showed elevated cross hybridization along the hybrid genome, confirming the weak differentiation between parental genomes. According to our genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) data, the observed genomic resemblance between the modern C. canephora genome (C) and the C. canephora-derived subgenome of C. arabica (C-a) appears rather considerable. Poor discrimination between C and Ca chromosomes supports the idea of low structural modifications of both genomes since the C. arabica speciation, at least in the frequency and distribution of repetitive sequences. GISH was also used to identify alien chromatin segments on chromosome spreads of a C liberica-introgressed line of C arabica. Further, use of GISH together with BAC-FISH analysis gave us additional valuable information about the physical localization of the C. liberica fragments carrying the S(H)3 factor involved in resistance to the coffee leaf rust. Overall, our results illustrate that FISH analysis is a complementary tool for molecular cytogenetic studies in coffee, providing rapid localization of either specific chromosomes or alien chromatin in introgressed genotypes derived from diploid species displaying substantial genomic differentiation from C. arabica.	2007	10.1139/G07-034		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Herzog, Eva; Frisch, Matthias	Efficient marker-assisted backcross conversion of seed-parent lines to cytoplasmic male sterility	PLANT BREEDING	For many crops, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a cornerstone of hybrid production. Efficient conversion of elite lines to CMS by marker-assisted backcrossing is therefore desirable. In contrast to gene introgression, for which donor segments around target genes have to be considered, background selection for CMS conversion focuses solely on recovery of the recurrent parent genome. The optimal selection strategies for CMS conversion will consequently differ from those for gene introgression and have not yet been investigated. The objectives of our study were to evaluate and optimize the resource requirements of CMS conversion programmes and to determine the most cost-effective use of single-marker (SM) and high-throughput (HT) assays for this purpose. We conducted computer simulations for CMS conversion of genetic models of sugar beet, rye, sunflower and rapeseed. CMS conversion required fewer resources than gene introgression with respect to population size, marker data points and number of backcross generations. Combining HT assays in early backcross generations with SM assays in advanced backcross generations further increased the cost-efficiency of CMS conversion for a broad range of cost ratios.	2013	10.1111/pbr.12021		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Hiebert, Colin W.; Thomas, Julian B.; McCallum, Brent D.; Humphreys, D. Gavin; DePauw, Ronald M.; Hayden, Matthew J.; Mago, Rohit; Schnippenkoetter, Wendelin; Spielmeyer, Wolfgang	An introgression on wheat chromosome 4DL in RL6077 (Thatcher*6/PI 250413) confers adult plant resistance to stripe rust and leaf rust (Lr67)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and stripe rust derived from the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line PI250413 was previously identified in RL6077 (=Thatcher*6/PI250413). The leaf rust resistance gene in RL6077 is phenotypically similar to Lr34 which is located on chromosome 7D. It was previously hypothesized that the gene in RL6077 could be Lr34 translocated to another chromosome. Hybrids between RL6077 and Thatcher and between RL6077 and 7DS and 7DL ditelocentric stocks were examined for first meiotic metaphase pairing. RL6077 formed chain quadrivalents and trivalents relative to Thatcher and Chinese Spring; however both 7D telocentrics paired only as heteromorphic bivalents and never with the multivalents. Thus, chromosome 7D is not involved in any translocation carried by RL6077. A genome-wide scan of SSR markers detected an introgression from chromosome 4D of PI250413 transferred to RL6077 through five cycles of backcrossing to Thatcher. Haplotype analysis of lines from crosses of Thatcher x RL6077 and RL6058 (Thatcher*6/PI58548) x RL6077 showed highly significant associations between introgressed markers (including SSR marker cfd71) and leaf rust resistance. In a separate RL6077-derived population, APR to stripe rust was also tightly linked with cfd71 on chromosome 4DL. An allele survey of linked SSR markers cfd71 and cfd23 on a set of 247 wheat lines from diverse origins indicated that these markers can be used to select for the donor segment in most wheat backgrounds. Comparison of RL6077 with Thatcher in field trials showed no effect of the APR gene on important agronomic or quality traits. Since no other known Lr genes exist on chromosome 4DL, the APR gene in RL6077 has been assigned the name Lr67.	2010	10.1007/s00122-010-1373-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Hill, Camilla Beate; Wong, Debbie; Tibbits, Josquin; Forrest, Kerrie; Hayden, Matthew; Zhang, Xiao-Qi; Westcott, Sharon; Angessa, Tefera Tolera; Li, Chengdao	Targeted enrichment by solution-based hybrid capture to identify genetic sequence variants in barley	SCIENTIFIC DATA	In barley and other cereal crops, phenological diversity drives adaptation to different cultivation areas. Improvement of barley yield and quality traits requires adaptation to specific production areas with introgression of favorable alleles dependent upon precise identification of the underlying genes. Combining targeted sequence capture systems with next-generation sequencing provides an efficient approach to explore target genetic regions at high resolution, and allows rapid discovery of thousands of genetic polymorphisms. Here, we apply a versatile target-capture method to detect genome-wide polymorphisms in 174 flowering time-related genes, chosen based on prior knowledge from barley, rice, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequences were generated across a phenologically diverse panel of 895 barley varieties, resulting a high mean depth coverage of similar to 25x allowing reliable discovery and calling of insertion-deletion (InDel) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Sequences of InDel and SNPs from the targeted enrichment were utilized to develop 67 Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers for validation. This work provides researchers and breeders a comprehensive molecular toolkit for the selection of phenology-related traits in barley.	2019	10.1038/s41597-019-0011-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Marker development	FALSE			FALSE	
Honig, Josh A.; Kubik, Christine; Averello, Vincenzo; Vaiciunas, Jennifer; Meyer, William A.; Bonos, Stacy A.	Classification of bentgrass (Agrostis) cultivars and accessions based on microsatellite (SSR) markers	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION	Genetic relationships among Agrostis species used for turf have been difficult to discern. Recent studies have either confirmed or contradicted previously proposed genetic relationships based on chromosome pairing behavior of inter-specific hybrids. The objective of the current study was to assess genetic relationships among Agrostis cultivars and accessions by using newly available A. stolonifera microsatellite (SSR) markers. Nuclear SSR (nuSSR) and chloroplast SSR (cpSSR) markers were used to genotype 16 individuals from each of 74 Agrostis cultivars and accessions. Genetic relationships based on nuSSR markers most closely resembled species relationships proposed by Jones in the 1950s. Contrary to the work of Jones, genetic relationships based on cpSSR markers indicated that A. canina was more closely related to A. stolonifera than to A. capillaris. We hypothesize that chloroplast introgression via interspecific hybridization between A. canina and A. stolonifera resulted in these species sharing common chloroplast genome lineages, while maintaining disparate nuclear genome lineages. Genetic relationships within Agrostis species based on nuSSR markers closely matched known pedigree relationships. Bayesian clustering analysis of nuSSR markers indicated that most modern seeded A. stolonifera cultivars exhibited high levels of admixture. Our study confirms that nuSSR markers distinguish Agrostis species and cultivars, and are valuable for studying genetic diversity and genetic relationships within the genus Agrostis.	2016	10.1007/s10722-015-0307-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker dev	FALSE			FALSE

Locus-dependent selection in crop-wild hybrids of lettuce under field conditions and its implication for GM crop development	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Gene escape from crops has gained much attention in the last two decades, as transgenes introgressing into wild populations could affect the latter's ecological characteristics. However, different genes have different likelihoods of introgression. The mixture of selective forces provided by natural conditions creates an adaptive mosaic of alleles from both parental species. We investigated segregation patterns after hybridization between lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and its wild relative, L. serriola. Three generations of hybrids (S(1), BC(1), and BC(1S1)) were grown in habitats mimicking the wild parent's habitat. As control, we harvested S(1) seedlings grown under controlled conditions, providing very limited possibility for selection. We used 89 AFLP loci, as well as more recently developed dominant markers, 115 retrotransposon markers (SSAP), and 28 NBS loci linked to resistance genes. For many loci, allele frequencies were biased in plants exposed to natural field conditions, including over-representation of crop alleles for various loci. Furthermore, Linkage disequilibrium was locally changed, allegedly by selection caused by the natural field conditions, providing ample opportunity for genetic hitchhiking. Our study indicates that when developing genetically modified crops, a judicious selection of insertion sites, based on knowledge of selective (dis)advantages of the surrounding crop genome under field conditions, could diminish transgene persistence.	2011	10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00188.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted introgression of opaque2 allele for rapid conversion of elite hybrids into quality protein maize	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Maize is a valuable source of food and feed worldwide. Maize endosperm protein is, however nutritionally poor due to the reduced levels of two essential amino acids, lysine and tryptophan. In this study, recessive opaque2 (o2) allele that confers enhanced endosperm lysine and tryptophan, was introgressed using marker-assisted backcross breeding into three normal inbred lines (HKI323, HKI1105 and HKI1128). These are the parental lines of three popular medium-maturing single cross hybrids (HM4, HM8 and HM9) in India. Gene-based simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (umc1066 and phi057) were successfully deployed for introgression of o2 allele. Background selection using genome-based SSRs helped in recovering of recurrent parent genome. The newly developed quality protein maize (QPM) inbreds showed modified kernels (25-50% opaqueness) coupled with high degree of phenotypic resemblance to the respective recipient lines, including grain yield. In addition, endosperm protein quality showed increased lysine and tryptophan in the inbreds to the range of 52-95% and 47-118%, respectively. The reconstituted QPM hybrids recorded significant enhancement of endosperm lysine (48-74%) and tryptophan (55-100%) in the endosperm. The QPM hybrids exhibited high phenotypic similarity with the original hybrids for morphological and yield contributing traits along with responses to some major diseases like turcicum leaf blight and maydis leaf blight. The grain yield of QPM hybrids was at par with their original versions under multilocation testing. These elite, high-yielding QPM hybrids with improved protein quality have been released and notified for commercial cultivation, and hold significant promise for improving nutritional security.	2018	10.1007/s12041-018-0914-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

To significantly broaden its genetic diversity and create a novel heterotic population for sustainable rapeseed breeding, this study reconstituted the genome of B. napus by replacing it with the subgenomes from 122 accessions of Brassica rapa (A) and 74 accessions of Brassica carinata () and developing a novel gene pool of B. napus through five rounds of extensive recurrent selection. When compared with traditional B. napus using SSR markers and high-throughput SNP/Indel markers through genotyping by sequencing, the newly developed gene pool and its homozygous progenies exhibited a large genetic distance, rich allelic diversity, new alleles and exotic allelic introgression across all 19 AC chromosomes. In addition to the abundant genomic variation detected in the AC genome, we also detected considerable introgression from the eight chromosomes of the B genome. Extensive trait variation and some genetic improvements were present from the early recurrent selection to later generations. This novel gene pool produced equally rich phenotypic variation and should be valuable for rapeseed genetic improvement. By reconstituting the genome of B. napus by introducing subgenomic variation within and between the related species using intense selection and recombination, the whole genome could be substantially reorganized. These results serve as an example of the manipulation of the genome of a young allopolyploid and provide insights into its rapid genome evolution affected by interspecific and intraspecific crosses.	2019	10.1111/pbi.13041		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Here we use Orychophragmus (Brassicaceae) as a model system to test the hypothesis that the whole chloroplast genomes (plastomes), with accumulation of more variations despite the slow evolution, can overcome these weaknesses. We used Illumina sequencing technology via a reference-guided assembly to construct complete plastomes of 17 individuals from six putatively assumed species in the genus. All plastomes are highly conserved in genome structure, gene order, and orientation, and they are around 153 kb in length and contain 113 unique genes. However, nucleotide variations are quite substantial to support the delimitation of all sampled species and to resolve interspecific relationships with high statistical supports. As expected, the estimated divergences between major clades and species are lower than those estimated from nrITS probably due to the slow substitution rate of the plastomes. However, the plastome and nrITS phylogenies were contradictory in the placements of most species, thus suggesting that these species may have experienced complex non-bifurcating evolutions with incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybrid introgressions. Overall, our case study highlights the importance of using plastomes to examine species boundaries and establish an independent phylogeny to infer the speciation history of plants.	2016	10.3389/fpls.2016.01826		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Mapping of the Ogura fertility restorer gene Rfo and development of Rfo allele-specific markers in canola (Brassica napus L.)	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and its corresponding nuclear fertility restorer gene, Rfo, have been introduced from radish to Brassica species by interspecific crosses. Rfo restores male fertility by altering the translational expression of Orf138, a mitochondrial gene, whose expression results in the male sterile phenotype. This system has been extensively investigated and breeding restorer lines for the Ogura CMS has become a major objective for hybrid seed production in many canola breeding programs. In this study, we have sequenced genomic clones of Rfo amplified from a canola restorer line R2000, licensed from INRA, France, and a Dow AgroSciences non-restorer line Nexera 705 using primers designed from the radish Rfo sequence (GenBank accession AJ550021). Sequence alignment revealed three homologous sequences of Rfo. Two of the sequences were present in both R2000 and Nexera 705 but the third one was present only in R2000. These results suggested that the first two sequences could be the homoeologous sequences of Rfo already existing in the canola genome and the third one could be the radish Rfo introduced into canola. Based on the sequence differences between the restorer and non-restorer lines, Rfo allele-specific PCR markers were developed. We also developed a high throughput, Rfo allele-specific Invader (R) assay through Third Wave Technologies. Linkage analysis revealed a co-segregation between the allele-specific marker and the phenotypes for fertility restoration. This allele-specific marker has been mapped in the linkage group N19 and proved to be very useful for direct selection of Rfo alleles for fertility restoration during marker-assisted introgression of the Ogura restorer for hybrid development in canola.	2008	10.1007/s11032-008-9207-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

To elucidate further the cytological and molecular mechanisms behind parental genome separation, Brassica carinata (2n = 34) X 0. violaceus hybrids were resynthesized and their chromosome/genomic complements analysed. center dot Methods F, hybrids of the cross were obtained following embryo rescue, and were investigated for their cytological behaviour and subjected to genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to determine the contribution of parental genomes. center dot Key Results All the F, plants with high fertility closely resembled B. carinata in morphological attributes. These were mixoploids with 2n chromosome numbers ranging from 17 to 35; however, 34, the same number as in B. carinata, was the most frequent number of chromosomes in ovary and pollen mother cells (PMCs). GISH clearly identified 16 chromosomes of B. nigra in ovary cells and PMCs with 2n = 34 and 35. However, no O. violaceus chromosome was detected, indicating the presence of the intact B. carinata genome and elimination of the entire O. violaceus genome. However, some AFLP bands specific for O. violaceus and novel for the two parents were detected in the leaves. Cells with fewer than 34 chromosomes had lost some B. oleracea chromosomes. F-2 plants were predominantly like B. carinata, but some contained O. violaceus characters. center dot Conclusions The cytological mechanism for the results involves complete and partial genome separation at mitosis in embryos of F, plants followed by chromosome doubling, elimination of cells with O. violaceus chromosomes and some introgression of O. violaceus genetic information.	2006	10.1093/aob/mcl073		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics/ didn't measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Huang, Feng; Fu, Xi; Efisue, Andrew; Zhang, Sisong; Xie, Guosheng; He, Wenchuang; Nevame, Adedze Y. M.; Jin, Deming	Genetically Characterizing a New Indica Cytoplasmic Male Sterility with Oryza glaberrima Cytoplasm for Its Potential Use in Hybrid Rice Production	CROP SCIENCE	Cytoplasmic diversification is of vital importance to avoid the genetic vulnerability of hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). A new indica cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), designated African rice (AF) CMS, has been derived from interspecific crosses using African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) as the cytoplasmic donor and genetically characterized for its potential use. The AF CMS lines were completely sterile whereas the fertility of its F-1 hybrids was readily restored. The restoration-maintenance relationship of AF CMS was consistent with that of sporophytic wild abortive (WA) and Indonesian paddy (ID) CMS but different from the gametophytic Honglian (HL) CMS. Specific banding patterns for AF CMS were identified by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). The AFLP markers can be used to detect genetic purity of seed stocks of AF CMS lines and their hybrids. Fertility segregation in F-2 populations of crosses between AF CMS lines and an introgression restorer line corresponded to a 3:1 fertile:sterile ratio, indicating a single major dominant restorer gene was involved. The fertility-restoring gene was located on chromosome 10 between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers RM304 and RM6100 at a genetic distance of 1.25 cM from RM6100. Molecular assays confirmed the introgression of a major restorer gene from O. glaberrima into the O. sativa genome. We conclude the new AF CMS system should be of great potential use in hybrid rice production.	2013	10.2135/cropsci2012.07.0444		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Huang, Yongji; Wu, Jiayun; Wang, Ping; Lin, Yanquan; Fu, Cheng; Deng, Zuhu; Wang, Qinnan; Li, Qiwei; Chen, Rukai; Zhang, Muqing	Characterization of Chromosome Inheritance of the Intergeneric BC2 and BC3 Progeny between Saccharum spp. and Erianthus arundinaceus	PLOS ONE	Erianthus arundinaceus (E. arundinaceus) has many desirable agronomic traits for sugarcane improvement, such as high biomass, vigor, rationing ability, tolerance to drought, and water logging, as well as resistance to pests and disease. To investigate the introgression of the E. arundinaceus genome into sugarcane in the higher generations, intergeneric BC2 and BC3 progeny generated between Saccharum spp. and E. arundinaceus were studied using the genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique. The results showed that the BC2 and BC3 generations resulted from n + n chromosome transmission. Furthermore, chromosome translocation occurred at terminal fragments from the E. arundinaceus chromosome in some progeny of Saccharum spp. and E. arundinaceus. Notably, the translocated chromosomes could be stably transmitted to their progeny. This study illustrates the characterization of chromosome inheritance of the intergeneric BC2 and BC3 progeny between Saccharum spp. and E. arundinaceus. This work could provide more useful molecular cytogenetic information for the germplasm resources of E. arundinaceus, and may promote further understanding of the germplasm resources of E. arundinaceus for sugarcane breeders to accelerate its progress in sugarcane commercial breeding.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0133722		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE

Development and bin mapping of gene-associated interspecific SNPs for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) introgression breeding efforts	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the largest producer of natural fibers for textile and is an important crop worldwide. Crop production is comprised primarily of G. hirsutum L., an allotetraploid. However, elite cultivars express very small amounts of variation due to the species monophyletic origin, domestication and further bottlenecks due to selection. Conversely, wild cotton species harbor extensive genetic diversity of prospective utility to improve many beneficial agronomic traits, fiber characteristics, and resistance to disease and drought. Introgression of traits from wild species can provide a natural way to incorporate advantageous traits through breeding to generate higher-producing cotton cultivars and more sustainable production systems. Interspecific introgression efforts by conventional methods are very time-consuming and costly, but can be expedited using marker-assisted selection. Results: Using transcriptome sequencing we have developed the first gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for wild cotton species G. tomentosum, G. mustelinum, G. armourianum and G. longicalyx. Markers were also developed for a secondary cultivated species G. barbadense cv. 3-79. A total of 62,832 non-redundant SNP markers were developed from the five wild species which can be utilized for interspecific germplasm introgression into cultivated G. hirsutum and are directly associated with genes. Over 500 of the G. barbadense markers have been validated by whole-genome radiation hybrid mapping. Overall 1,060 SNPs from the five different species have been screened and shown to produce acceptable genotyping assays. Conclusions: This large set of 62,832 SNPs relative to cultivated G. hirsutum will allow for the first high-density mapping of genes from five wild species that affect traits of interest, including beneficial agronomic and fiber characteristics. Upon mapping, the markers can be utilized for marker-assisted introgression of new germplasm into cultivated cotton and in subsequent breeding of agronomically adapted types, including cultivar development.	2014	10.1186/1471-2164-15-945		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Root imaging showing comparisons in root distribution and ontogeny in novel Festulolium populations and closely related perennial ryegrass varieties	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY	The incorporation of new sophisticated phenotyping technologies within a crop improvement program allows for a plant breeding strategy that can include selections for major root traits previously inaccessible due to the challenges in their phenotype assessment. High-throughput precision phenotyping technology is employed to evaluate root ontogeny and progressive changes to root architecture of both novel amphiploid and introgression lines of Festulolium over four consecutive months of the growing season and these compared under the same time frame to that of closely related perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) varieties. Root imaging using conventional photography and assembled multiple merged images was used to compare frequencies in root number, their distribution within 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths within soil columns, and progressive changes over time. The Festulolium hybrids had more extensive root systems in comparison with L. perenne, and this was especially evident at depth. It was shown that the acquisition of extensive root systems in Festulolium hybrids was not dependent on the presence of an entire Festuca genome. On the contrary, the most pronounced effect on root development within the four Festulolium populations studied was observed in the introgression line Bx509, where a single small genome sequence from F. arundinacea had been previously transferred onto its homoeologous site on the long arm of chromosome 3 of an otherwise complete L. perenne genome. This demonstrates that a targeted introgression-breeding approach may be sufficient to confer a significant improvement in the root morphology in Lolium without a significant compromise to its genome integrity. The forage production of Bx509 was either higher (months 1-3) or equivalent to (month 4) that of its L. perenne parent control demonstrating that the enhanced root development achieved by the introgression line was without compromise to its agronomic performance.	2018	10.1002/fes3.145		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Hurtado, M.; Vilanova, S.; Plazas, M.; Gramazio, P.; Prohens, J.	Development of Breeding Programmes in Eggplant with Different Objectives and Approaches: Three Examples of Use of Primary Genepool Diversity	II INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HORTICULTURE IN EUROPE	Diversity available in the eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) primary genepool can be used for developing new improved materials with better characteristics. We have initiated three breeding programmes in this crop aimed at different objectives: a) development of commercial hybrids for greenhouse cultivation (hybrids programme); b) improvement of the pickling 'Almagro' eggplant landrace (Almagro programme); and, c) introgression of traits of interest from the wild S. incanum into the genetic background of S. melongena (introgression lines programme). In the case of the hybrids programme we used as sources of variation a number of commercially successful hybrids of the black-type which presented a broad genetic diversity, as assessed with AFLP and SSR markers. These hybrids have been selfed for several generations and have been subjected to phenotypic selection for the traits of commercial interest. The lines obtained have a high degree of intra-line uniformity and we are obtaining experimental hybrids using as parents lines showing a good performance and a high genetic divergence. The Almagro programme is aimed at reducing the calyx prickliness of the original landrace. A selection programme has allowed selecting Almagro materials with lower prickliness. A backcross breeding programme using as donor parents a pickling eggplant with low prickliness and prickle-free fresh market eggplants has been initiated, in which selection using a participatory approach has been done for low prickliness and Almagro eggplant morphotype. At present, backcross materials up to the BC3 generation have been obtained and are being tested in commercial fields of farmers. Finally, the introgression lines programme is aimed at developing a set of introgression lines of S. incanum in the genetic background of S. melongena by means of backcrossing and marker assisted selection. In this case, a genetic map has been obtained and selection is done so that the whole genome of S. incanum is represented in overlapping segments present in the materials used in the successive backcross generations. At present the BC3 generation is being selected for further backcrossing. These three programmes are aimed at different objectives and are a typical example of different approaches, conventional and modern tools, for exploiting the diversity present in the primary genepool for the genetic improvement of a vegetable crop.	2015			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Hussain, Syed Wajid; Williams, Warren Mervyn	Chromosome pairing and fertility of interspecific hybrids between Trifolium repens L. and T.occidentale Coombe	PLANT BREEDING	Trifolium occidentale is a diploid wild relative with the potential to improve the drought and salt tolerances of white clover (Trifolium repens). Previous work has shown that it is possible to efficiently produce large T.repensxT.occidentale breeding populations using colchicine-doubled (4x) T.occidentale. For effective introgression (backcross) breeding, it is also essential that interspecific chromosome pairing and recombination occur. In this study, it was apparent that chromosome pairing was occurring not only between T.occidentale and T.repens subgenomes, but also between the ancestral subgenomes of T.repens. Thus, interspecific hybridization has the potential for major genome recombination and opens the way for introgression of traits from T.occidentale into white clover.	2016	10.1111/pbr.12344		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Iefimenko, T. S.; Antonyuk, M. Z.; Martynenko, V. S.; Navalihina, A. G.; Ternovska, T. K.	Introgression of Aegilops mutica genes into common wheat genome	CYTOLOGY AND GENETICS	Introgression of genetic material from wheat wild relatives into the common wheat genome remains important. This is a natural and inexhaustible source of enrichment of the wheat gene pool with genes that improve wheat's adaptive potential. Hexaploid lines F-4-F-5 of wheat type were developed via hybridization of common wheat Aurora (AABBDD) and genome-substituted amphidiploid Aurotica (AABBTT). The hexaploid genome of the latter includes the diploid genome TT from wheat relative Aegilops mutica instead of subgenome DD of common wheat. F-1-F-3 hybrids had limited self-fertility, which had substantially increased for some derivatives in F-4-F-5. For all generations, development of the lines was accompanied by cytogenetic control of the chromosome numbers. The chromosome numbers varied in general from 33 to 46 depending upon generation. In most descendants, that number was 42 chromosomes in F-4 when plants with chromosome numbers 40-44 were selected in each generation. F-5 lines originate from nine selffertile F-2 plants, differ from Aurora according to some morphological characters, and have alien DNA in their genome as was demonstrated by DNA dot-blot hybridization with genomic DNA of Aegilops mutica as a probe.	2018	10.3103/S0095452718010048		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Rapid and high-precision marker assisted backcrossing to introgress the SUB1 QTL into BR11, the rainfed lowland rice mega variety of Bangladesh	EUPHYTICA	Flooding is one of the major hazards of rice production for the rainfed lowland rice ecosystem, and tolerant cultivars are urgently needed to help protect farmers from submergence damage. A quick and efficient strategy was implemented to introgress SUB1, a major QTL for submergence tolerance, into a rainfed lowland mega variety BR11 of Bangladesh by only two backcrosses and one selfing generation. In marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC), one tightly-linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) and two gene-based markers, four flanking SSR and 116 background SSR markers were used for foreground, recombinant and background selection, respectively, in backcrosses between a SUB1 donor IR40931-33-1-3-2 and BR11. BR11-Sub1, identified in a BC2F2 plant, possessed BR11 type SSR alleles on all fragments analyzed except the SUB1 QTL. The introgression size in BR11-Sub1 was 800 Kb indicating approximately 99.8% identity to BR11. BR11-Sub1 along with other introgression lines showed submergence tolerance similar to the tolerant parent. Yield, yield-component parameters and grain physico-chemical properties showed successful recovery of the BR11 traits in BR11-Sub1, with yield potential ranging from 5.2 to 5.6 t/ha, not significantly different from the recurrent parent mega variety BR11. Producing a large number (similar to 1000) of backcross F-1 plants was considered essential to achieve recombination on both sides of the gene, limiting linkage drag with only two backcrosses. A large number of background markers ensured proper recovery of the recurrent parent genome in the BC2F2 generation. The study demonstrates a rapid and highly precise strategy to introgress a major QTL by BC2F2 generation into a modern rice variety using an unadapted donor. The variety can replace BR11 on more than 2 million of ha in Bangladesh and provide major increases in rice production.	2011	10.1007/s10681-010-0272-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Imai, Ize; Kimball, Jennifer A.; Conway, Benjamin; Yeater, Kathleen M.; McCouch, Susan R.; McClung, Anna	Validation of yield-enhancing quantitative trait loci from a low-yielding wild ancestor of rice	MOLECULAR BREEDING	A set of introgression lines (ILs) containing chromosomal segments from O. rufipogon (IRGC 105491), a wild relative of O. sativa, in the genetic background of an elite US variety, cv. Jefferson, was developed to confirm the performance of six yield-enhancing quantitative trait loci (QTL). Fifty BC3F3 ILs containing homozygous O. rufipogon introgressions at each of the target QTL regions, and as few background introgressions as possible, were selected for evaluation of yield and 14 yield-related traits in field studies conducted over 2 years at four locations in the southern USA. Performance of the IL families was compared with three commercial inbreds and one hybrid variety. IL families carrying introgressions from the low-yielding wild parent at the QTL yld2.1 and yld6.1 yielded 27.7 and 26.1 % more than Jefferson, respectively. IL yld2A, which possesses yld2.1, also performed well under alternate wetting and drying conditions in two field locations. After the first year of field trials, 10 of the top-performing BC3F4 families, representing five of the QTL targets, were genotyped with an Illumina 1,536 assay to define the size and location of the wild introgressions. BC3F4 families with the fewest background introgressions were backcrossed to Jefferson and selfed. The resulting BC4F2 families were screened with targeted single nucleotide polymorphism assays to identify individuals carrying homozygous introgressions across the target QTL. Twelve ILs, representing each of the six QTL targets, have been submitted to the Genetic Stocks Oryza Collection for studies on transgressive variation and as interspecific pre-breeding lines.	2013	10.1007/s11032-013-9855-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

In the present study, microsatellite markers were employed to confirm the process of introgression in F(2)hybrids derived from interspecific crosses of Oleiferous brassica species viz., B. napus (AACC genome-used as female parent) crossed with each B. juncea (AABB) and B. rapa (AA). A total of 31 SSR primers were utilized and 99 alleles were detected, with 69 (69.7%) being polymorphic. Polymorphism information content of the primer sets ranged from 0.24 to 0.75. In population of B. napus x B. junceae, pair wise similarity indices ranged from 4.4 to 9.2and from 4.2 to 8.2 in F-2 hybrids ofB. napus x B. rapa. The deviation of Introgressed hybrids towards female parent in both populations revealed that C genome has played a vital role in the introgression process of brassica species under study. Our results stressed upon the use of SSR markers in assessment of genetic diversity at molecular level.	2017			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker development	FALSE			FALSE	
Ivanizs, Laszlo; Farkas, Andras; Linc, Gabriella; Molnar-Lang, Marta; Molnar, Istvan	Molecular cytogenetic and morphological characterization of two wheat-barley translocation lines	PLOS ONE	Barley chromosome 5H, carrying important QTLs for plant adaptation and tolerance to abiotic stresses, is extremely instable in the wheat genetic background and is eliminated in the early generations of wheat-barley crosses. A spontaneous wheat-barley 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation was previously obtained among the progenies of the Mv9kr1 x Igri hybrid. The present work reports on the transfer of the 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation into a modern wheat cultivar, Mv Bodri, in order to use it in the wheat breeding program. The comparison of the hybridization bands of DNA repeats HvT01, pTa71, (GAA)(n) and the barley centromere-specific (AGGGAG)(n) in Igri barley and the 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation, together with the visualization of the barley chromatin made it possible to determine the size of the introgressed barley segment, which was approximately 74% of the whole 5HS. Of the 29 newly developed PCR markers, whose source ESTs were selected from the Genome Zipper of barley chromosome 5H, 23 were mapped in the introgressed 1-0.26 FL 5HS bin, three were located in the missing C-0.26 FL region, while three markers were specific for 5HL. The translocation breakpoint was flanked by markers Hv7502 and Hv3949. A comparison of the parental wheat cultivars and the wheat-barley introgression lines indicated that the presence of the translocation improved tillering ability in the Mv9kr1 and Mv Bodri genetic background. The similar or better yield components under high- or low-input cultivation environments, respectively, indicated that the 5HS-7DS.7DL translocation had little or no negative effect on yield components, making it a promising genotype to improve wheat genetic diversity. These results promise to accelerate functional genomic studies on barley chromosome 5H and to support pre-breeding and breeding research on wheat.	2018	10.1371/journal.pone.0198758		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Utilisation of wild canes from China	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL	In 2002 a collaborative program of breeding and research was commenced, aiming to utilise wild germplasm from China for sugarcane improvement in both China and Australia. Some results and recommendations arising from this program to date are reported here. The program aimed to: 1. Characterise genetic diversity in Chinese S. spontaneum and Erianthus arundinaceus; 2. Conduct crossing between Chinese S. spontaneum and Erianthus spp. and sugarcane, and initial evaluation of the resulting progeny; 3. Assess if and how DNA markers can be used to identify genome regions of positive or negative value from wild clones, and to assist in programs aiming to introduce new genes from wild canes into commercial cultivars; 4. To quantify genotype x environment interactions between Australia and China. Results from the genetic diversity studies indicated a high level of genetic diversity in both S. spontaneum and Erianthus arundinaceus in China, and provide a basis for targeted sampling and use of this material in future breeding efforts or for core collections. Two hundred and two crosses from a range of S. spontaneum and Erianthus clones generated viable seeds, and 100 of these crosses have been verified (to date) using DNA markers as producing true hybrids. These results were significant in relation to Erianthus spp. in providing (to our knowledge) the first report of verified fertile Saccharum x Erianthus hybrids in the world, despite many past efforts. Several case study populations derived from S. spontaneum and Erianthus were used for Quantitative Trait loci (QTL) mapping. Several apparently important QTL for cane yield were identified from S. spontaneum. An approach to apply DNA markers in future introgression breeding in sugarcane is recommended, based on the results and experience obtained. Another significant result was the first (to our knowledge) documentation of genotype x country interactions. Somewhat surprisingly, moderate to high (>0.6) genetic correlations in performance of families and clones between trials in China and Australia were observed, despite some contrasting environmental and management conditions. This result supports ongoing collaboration between China and Australia via exchange of selection trial results and selected germplasm.	2011			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Jacobsen, Evert; Schouten, Henk J.	Cisgenesis Next Step in Classical Plant Breeding	MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES IN CROP IMPROVEMENT, SECOND EDITION	Plant breeding is an ongoing activity that started many years ago through domestication of crops by farmers' selection. After discovery of Mendel's Law plant breeding became gradually more science driven. Nowadays, plant breeding is developing very rapidly because of the development of many new technologies and scientific disciplines that can be applied. Approaches for genetic modification (GM) of plants developed quickly in the eighties and nineties of last century, but it is the first technology that has not been widely accepted in the world by NGOs and consumers. GMO-regulations have been developed which are by the strict application obstructing the development of GM-varieties, especially in Europe. These regulations are based on the modification process and on transgenes originating from non-crossable species. These transgenes are a new gene pool for plant breeding. However, it turns out that cisgenes, which are genes from the plant itself or from crossable species, will be more and more available. They belong to the existing breeder's gene pool but they are treated in the regulation like transgenes. It is recommended to exempt from the regulation GM-plants that contain cisgenes only. This chapter provides a historical context of cisgenesis. Further, it discusses breeding approaches of autogamous, allogamous and vegetatively propagated crops. Options for cisgenesis in these kind op crops are presented. Some examples are disease resistance in potato and apple using R- and Avr-genes, hybrid seed production using genes for male sterility, or S_RNase genes for changing self-incompatibility. We regard cisgenesis as next important step in introgression breeding, using natural genes spatie. Cisgenesis has also been compared with intragenics and induced mutation breeding. We recommend less stringent oversight for intragenic plants, compared to transgenic plants especially when it concerns RNAi.	2010	10.1007/978-90-481-2967-6_25		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Jalikop, S. H.	Tree and fruit traits of progenies from the cross between (Annona cherimola Mill. x A. squamosa L.) x A. reticulata L. and approaches for the introgression of valuable genes from A. reticulata L.	EUPHYTICA	Annona reticulata L. possesses many traits desirable in other edible annonas, and hybridization is the simplest means to combine desirable features of related species. In this study, A. reticulata was hybridized with atemoya (A. cherimola Mill. x A. squamosa L.), and 250 trispecies hybrids were studied for 28 traits (12 tree traits and 16 fruit traits) with the objective of salvaging useful genes from the three edible annonas and determining the extent of variation in the progeny. The heterozygous nature of Annona spp. and simultaneous segregation of three distant genomes resulted in a tremendous heterogeneity in the progenies. The fitness of the progenies ranged from very vigorous to very weak, with a wide range of values for tree height (1.75-5.9 m), canopy spread (1.15-5.07 m) and trunk circumference (11-38.5 cm). The occurrence of diverse and novel segregants for tree shape and branching pattern suggested the possibility of identifying efficient ideotypes. Variation in fruit shape, skin colour and skin surface in addition to wide range of values for total soluble solids (17-32A degrees B), acidity (0.16-2.2%) and number of seeds per/100 g fruit (3-49) showed that exciting opportunities existed in terms of selecting for desirable traits. Among the segregating population were slow-fruit-ripening genotypes that required up to 12 days from harvesting to ripening. Interestingly, some recombinants produced fruits resembling A. glabra and A. muricata fruits, suggesting that one or the other parental species of the trihybrid could be progenitor of these two non-parental species. These results demonstrate that A. reticulata is potentially a valuable source of a variety of novel traits. However, the F(1) trihybrids exhibited reduced fertility with pronounced undesirable traits of A. reticulata, and the survival of F(2) trees was poor, with those that did survive being extremely weak and failing to flower or set fruit. Consequently, backcrossing may be more suitable approach than advancing trihybrid generation for transferring desirable genes from A. reticulata. Backcrossing F(1) progeny of [(A. cherimola x A. squamosa) x A. reticulata] to A. squamosa, a highly fertile species, is expected to yield productive introgressants in which the contribution of the A. squamosa genome will be extended from 25 to 62.5% in the F(1)BC(1) generation. The genetics is described herein based on the expressions of certain tree and fruit traits in the progeny.	2010	10.1007/s10681-009-0059-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Jauhar, PP; Peterson, TS	Cytological analyses of hybrids and derivatives of hybrids between durum wheat and Thinopyrum bessarabicum, using multicolour fluorescent GISH	PLANT BREEDING	The wheat progenitors and other wild relatives continue to be important sources of genes for agronomically desirable traits, which can be transferred into durum wheat (Triticum turgidum; 2n = 4x = 28; AABB genomes) cultivars via hybridization. Chromosome pairing in durum x alien species hybrids provides an understanding of genomic relationships, which is useful in planning alien gene introgression strategies. Two durum cultivars, 'Lloyd' and 'Langdon', were crossed with diploid wheatgrass, Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14; JJ), to synthesize F-1 hybrids (2n = 3x = 21; ABJ) with Ph1. 'Langdon' disomic substitution 5D(5B) was used as a female parent to produce F-1 hybrids without Ph1, which resulted in elevation of pairing between durum and grass chromosomes - an important feature from the breeding standpoint. The F-1 hybrids were backcrossed to respective parental cultivars and BC1 progenies were raised. 'Langdon' 5D(5B) substitution x Th. bessarabicum F-1 hybrids were crossed with normal 'Langdon' to obtain BC1 progeny. Chromosome pairing relationships were studied in F-1 hybrids and BC1 progenies using both conventional staining and fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (fl-GISH) techniques. Multicolour fl-GISH was standardized for characterizing the nature and specificity of chromosome pairing: A-B, A-J and B-J pairing. The A-J and B-J pairing will facilitate gene introgression in durum wheat. Multicolour fl-GISH will help in characterizing alien chromosome segments captured in the durum complement and in their location in the A and/or B genome, thereby accelerating chromosome engineering research.	2006	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2006.01176.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Jena, Kshirod K.	The species of the genus Oryza and transfer of useful genes from wild species into cultivated rice, O. saliva	BREEDING SCIENCE	The genus Oryza has 24 species out of which two are cultivated (O. saliva and O. glaberrima) and 22 are wild species. Of the 22 wild species, six are in the primary gene pool of O. saliva complex and these wild species are easily crossable with the major cultivated species. These have the same AA genome as O. saliva. However, there are 10 wild species under O. officinalis complex having BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE and FF genomes. The wild species of this complex are in the secondary gene pool and are cross incompatible with O. saliva. There are six most distantly related wild species with either diploids or tetraploids of GG, HHJJ and HHKK genomes and are highly cross incompatible with O. saliva. All the 22 wild species of Oryza are a vast reservoir of genes for biotic and abiotic stresses resistance. Some of the yield enhancing traits/genes from AA genome wild species have been identified and mapped with molecular markers for their integration into O. saliva genome. A broad-spectrum resistance gene for bacterial blight resistance (Xa21) has been identified in O. longistaminata and introduced into many rice cultivars. Advances in biotechnology have facilitated the development of interspecific hybrids between O. saliva and wild species of secondary and tertiary gene pools. Some important genes Pi40 and Bph18 for resistance to blast and brown planthopper, respectively, have been successfully transferred into elite cultivars from O. australiensis and the function of one blast resistance gene (Pi9) derived from O. minuta is elucidated. Many important genes from the most distantly related wild species such as O. alta, O. granulata, O. longiglumis and O. coarctata are expected to be transferred into cultivated rice in the future using the latest tools of molecular genetics and biotechnology.	2010	10.1270/jsbbs.60.518		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Jenkins, Johnie N.; McCarty, Jack C., Jr.; Campbell, B. Todd; Hayes, R. W.; Wu, Jixiang; Saha, Sukumar; Stelly, David	Genotypic comparisons of chromosomes 01, 04, and 18 from three tetraploid species of Gossypium in topcrosses with five elite cultivars of G. hirsutum L.	EUPHYTICA	Upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. is the most widely planted cultivated cotton in the United States and the world. The other cultivated tetraploid species G. barbadense L. is planted on considerable less area; however, it produces extra long, strong, and fine fibers which spins into superior yarn. The wild cotton tetraploid species G. tomentosum Nuttall ex Seemann, native to the Hawaiian Archipelago also exhibits traits, such as drought tolerance, that would also be desirable to transfer to Upland cotton. Long-termbreeding efforts using whole genome crosses between Upland and these species have not been successful in transferring very many desirable alleles into Upland cotton. Our chromosome substitution lines (CSL) have one chromosome or chromosome arm from an alien species backcrossed into the Upland cotton line, TM-1, via aneuploid technology. Five Upland cultivars were crossed with CS-B01, CS-T01, CS-B04, CS-T04, CSB18 and CS-T18 and TM-1 the recurrent parent of the CSLs. This provided an opportunity to determine the effects of chromosomes 01, 04, and 18 from the three species in crosses with the five cultivars. Predicted genotypic mean effects of the parents, F-2, and F-3 generations for eight agronomic and fiber traits of importance were compared. The predicted hybrid mean effects for the three chromosomes from each species were different for several of the traits across cultivars. There was no single chromosome or species that was superior for all traits in crosses. Parental and hybrid lines often differed in the effect of a particular chromosome among the three species. The predicted genotypic mean effects for F-2 and F-3, with a few exceptions, generally agree with our previous results for additive and dominance genetic effects of these CSL.	2017	10.1007/s10681-017-1895-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Jenkins, Johnie N.; McCarty, Jack C.; Hayes, Russell W.; Stelly, David M.; Saha, Sukumar	Registration of RMBHMTUP-C4, a Random-Mated Cotton Population Containing Alleles from Four Gossypium Species	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS	The genetic base for upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) breeding needs more diversity. Use of Gossypium wild species is of interest to breeders, but interspecific crosses between G. hirsutum and wild tetraploid species or the cultivated tetraploid species G. barbadense L. have not been widely used due to the extreme difficulty of extracting elite lines in later generations.Following a nonconventional breeding approach, we used 32 chromosome substitution lines to capture allelic diversity from three donor tetraploid Gossypium species and combined that with the intraspecific allelic diversity among five upland cultivars. By random-mating the 32 F-1 hybrids and subsequent generations for five cycles, the intra- and interspecific diversity from four Gossypium AD-genome species was combined in a new random-mated population dubbed Random Mated Barbadense, Hirsutum, Mustelinum, Tomentosum, Upland Population (RMBHMTUP-C4; Reg. no. GP-1061, PI 690471). This unique population should facilitate efforts to diversify the genetic base for upland cotton breeding. Despite its allelic diversity, this population has average phenotypic and fiber characteristics much like an upland cultivar. During development, we did not observe breeding problems normally observed in conventional interspecific crosses. This should add to the usefulness of this population for introgression of alleles from these tetraploid species. We harvested about 2209 bolls each cycle of random mating (11,045 bolls). Assuming 25 seed per boll, this equates to 276,125 hand-crossed seed, each from union of two genetically unique gametes.	2019	10.3198/jpr2019.05.0024crg		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Jensen, KB; Maughan, KW; Asay, KH	Characterization of amphiploid hybrids between bluebunch and thickspike wheatgrasses	CROP SCIENCE	An amphiploid derivative from hybrids between bluebunch wheatgrass (2n = 2x = 14) [Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) A. Love] and thickspike wheatgrass (2n = 4x = 28) [Elymus lanceolatus (Scribner and Smith) Gould] was developed to compare cytological, morphological, anatomical, and seed characteristics between the triploid F, hybrids (2n = 3x = 21) and their colchicine induced hexaploid (2n 6x = 42) derivative (C-0). The amphiploid population produced an average of 3.1 seeds spikelet(-1) and pollen stainability averaged 85.5%. Seed set under self-pollination in the amphiploids ranged from < 1% to > 99% with an average of 50%. Fifty-eight of the 103 plants studied were hexaploid (2n = 6x = 42). The remaining plants had chromosomes ranging from 2n = 39 to 2n = 44 and were less fertile than the euploids. Meiosis in the euploid plants was regular and typical of a segmental autoallohexaploid St(1)St(1)St(2)St(2)HH. The most common meiotic chromosome configuration was 21 bivalents. A high frequency of bivalents and a low frequency of quadrivalents indicate that the St genomes of the two parental species have diverged. The amphiploids had thicker culms, more leaves per culm, and longer and wider leaves than either parental species. Multivariale analysis demonstrated that the amphiploids, though morphologically similar to the parental species, was distinct. In general, C-0 hybrids were less vigorous than the F, from which they were derived. Through amphiploidy, genetic introgression between the two species is possible.	2006	10.2135/cropsci2005-06-0155		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Breeders have enhanced grain productivity of maize hybrids by pyramiding desirable characteristics for larger ears. However, loci selected for improving grain productivity remain largely unclear. Here, we show that a serine/threonine protein kinase encoding gene KERNEL NUMBER PER ROW6 (KNR6) determines pistillate floret number and ear length. Overexpression of KNR6 or introgression of alleles lacking the insertions of two transposable elements in the regulatory region of KNR6 can significantly enhance grain yield. Further in vitro evidences indicate that KNR6 can interact with an Arf GTPase-activating protein (AGAP) and its phosphorylation by KNR6 may affect ear length and kernel number. This finding provides knowledge basis to enhance maize hybrids grain yield. Selection of kernel number per ear has improved maize yield, but the genetic base is unclear. Here, the authors reveal that a serine/threonine protein kinase KNR6 is a positive regulator of the trait and show in vitro evidences that KNR6 may function through phosphorylating an Arf GTPase-activating protein.	2020	10.1038/s41467-020-14746-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev.

Jiang, Haichao; Li, Zhi; Liu, Jia; Shen, Zhikang; Gao, Guanjun; Zhang, Qinglu; He, Yuqing	Development and evaluation of improved lines with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast using nine resistance genes	RICE	BackgroundRice blast disease is a major restriction in rice production. That is usually managed using chemical pesticides, which are expensive in terms of cost and environment hazards. Use of blast-resistance genes to develop resistant varieties may therefore be a more economical and environmentally friendly method for effective control.ResultsIn this study, we improved the blast resistance of four sterile lines, Y58S, GuangZhan63S (GZ63), C815S and HD9802S, by introgression of 9 cloned broad-spectrum blast resistance genes Pi37, Pit, Pid3, Pigm, Pi36, Pi5, Pi54, Pikm and Pb1. Through molecular marker-assisted selection and backcross breeding, 31 single-gene derived lines and 20 double-gene combination lines were obtained. When infected naturally, single-gene lines with Pigm or Pid3 showed significantly enhanced resistance during whole growth period relative to their recurrent parent. Single-gene lines with Pi37, Pi5, Pit, Pi36, Pi54 or Pikm showed significantly enhanced resistance in some of the four backgrounds. No obviously enhanced resistance was observed in single-gene line with Pb1 for the whole growth period. Compared with recurrent parents, most of the double-gene lines showed improved resistance. Among these double-gene lines, lines with Pi37/Pid3, Pi5/Pi54, Pi54/Pid3 or Pigm/Pi37, exhibited significantly enhanced resistance and observable additive effects.ConclusionsTwo blast resistance genes, Pigm and Pid3, showed significantly enhanced resistance for the whole rice growth period, and six blast resistance genes Pi37, Pi5, Pit, Pi36, Pi54 or Pikm showed significantly enhanced resistance for some of the four backgrounds. Double-gene lines with Pi37/Pid3, Pi5/Pi54, Pi54/Pid3 and Pigm/Pi37 exhibited significantly enhanced resistance and observable additive effects. These lines could be used in rice hybrid and production.	2019	10.1186/s12284-019-0292-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Jiang, Yanyou; Yang, Yongzhi; Lu, Zhiqiang; Wan, Dongshi; Ren, Guangpeng	Interspecific delimitation and relationships among four Ostrya species based on plastomes	BMC GENETICS	BackgroundThe genus Ostrya (Betulaceae) contains eight species and four of them are distributed in China. However, studies based on limited informative sites of several chloroplast markers failed to resolve interspecific delimitation and relationships among the four Chinese species. In this study, we aimed to use the whole chloroplast genomes to address these two issues.ResultsWe assembled and annotated 33 complete chloroplast genomes (plastomes) of the four Chinese species, representing 17 populations across most of their geographical distributions. Each species contained samples of several individuals that cover most of geographic distributions of the species. All plastomes are highly conserved in genome structure and gene order, with a total length of 158-159kb and 122 genes. Phylogenetic analyses of whole plastomes, non-coding regions and protein-coding genes produced almost the same topological relationships. In contrast to the well-delimitated species boundary inferred from the nuclear ITS sequence variations, three of the four species are non-monophyletic in the plastome trees, which is consistent with previous studies based on a few chloroplast markers.ConclusionsThe high incongruence between the ITS and plastome trees may suggest the widespread occurrences of hybrid introgression and incomplete lineage sorting during the divergence of these species. In addition, the plastomes with more informative sites compared with a few chloroplast markers still failed to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the four species, and further studies involving population genomic data may be needed to better understand their evolutionary histories.	2019	10.1186/s12863-019-0733-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	*did not quantify introgression (reticulate evolution)	FALSE			FALSE	
Jorgensen, Rikke Bagger; Hauser, Thure; D'Hertefeldt, Tina; Andersen, Naja Steen; Hooftman, Danny	The variability of processes involved in transgene dispersal-case studies from Brassica and related genera	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH	Background, aim, and scope We strive to predict consequences of genetically modified plants (GMPs) being cultivated openly in the environment, as human and animal health, biodiversity, agricultural practise and farmers' economy could be affected. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the risk assessment of GMPs is burdened by uncertainty. One of the reasons for the uncertainty is that the GMPs are interacting with the ecosystems at the release site thereby creating variability. This variability, e. g. in gene flow, makes consequence analysis difficult. The review illustrates the great uncertainty of results from gene-flow analysis. Main features Many independent experiments were performed on the individual processes in gene flow. The results comprise information both from laboratory, growth chambers and field trials, and they were generated using molecular or phenotypic markers and analysis of fitness parameters. Monitoring of the extent of spontaneous introgression in natural populations was also performed. Modelling was used as an additional tool to identify key parameters in gene flow. Results The GM plant may affect the environment directly or indirectly by dispersal of the transgene. Magnitude of the transgene dispersal will depend on the GM crop, the agricultural practise and the environment of the release site. From case-to-case these three factors provide a variability that is reflected in widely different likelihoods of transgene dispersal and fitness of introgressed plants. In the present review, this is illustrated through a bunch of examples mostly from our own research on oilseed rape, Brassica napus. In the Brassica cases, the variability affected all five main steps in the process of gene dispersal. The modelling performed suggests that in Brassica, differences in fitness among plant genome classes could be a dominant factor in the establishment and survival of introgressed populations. Discussion Up to now, experimental analyses have mainly focused on studying the many individual processes of gene flow. This can be criticised, as these experiments are normally carried out in widely different environments and with different genotypes, and thus providing bits and pieces difficult to assemble. Only few gene-flow studies have been performed in natural populations and over several plant generations, though this could give a more coherent and holistic view. Conclusion The variability inherent in the processes of gene flow in Brassica is apparent and remedies are wished for. One possibility is to expose the study species to additional experiments and monitoring, but this is costly and will likely not cover all possible scenarios. Another remedy is modelling gene flow. Modelling is a valuable tool in identifying key factors in the gene-flow process for which more knowledge is needed, and identifying parameters and processes which are relatively insensitive to change and therefore require less attention in future collections of data. But the interdependence between models and experimental data is extensive, as models depend on experimental data for their development or testing. Recommendations More and more transgenic varieties are being grown worldwide harbouring genes that might potentially affect the environment ( e. g. drought tolerance, salt tolerance, disease tolerance, pharmaceutical genes). This calls for a thorough risk assessment. However, in Brassica, the limited and uncertain knowledge on gene flow is an obstacle to this. Modelling of gene flow should be optimised, and modelling outputs verified in targeted field studies and at the landscape level. Last but not least, it is important to remember that transgene flow in itself is not necessarily a thread, but it is the consequences of gene flow that may jeopardise the ecosystems and the agricultural production. This emphasises the importance of consequence analysis of genetically modified plants.	2009	10.1007/s11356-009-0142-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Julian, O.; Herraiz, J.; Corella, S.; di-Lolli, I.; Soler, S.; Diez, M. J.; Perez-de-Castro, A.	Initial development of a set of introgression lines from Solanum peruvianum PI 126944 into tomato: exploitation of resistance to viruses	EUPHYTICA	Resistance to Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), among other diseases, has been reported in Solanum peruvianum PI 126944. Introgression lines (ILs) from S. peruvianum PI 126944 into the genetic background of cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) are being developed. Several generations were derived from three interspecific hybrids previously obtained. A lot of crosses and embryo rescue were required until the third backcross, due to the high degree of incompatibility existing between tomato and PI 126944. Crosses between F-1 plants were made to obtain a pseudo-F-2 generation. The same procedure was followed up to the pseudo-F-6 generation. Additional crosses between plants of different generations were made in order to increase progeny. Of 263 molecular markers tested, 105 were polymorphic between tomato and PI 126944. This set of polymorphic markers consisted of 90 simple sequence repeats (SSR) and 15 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS). The amount of the S. peruvianum genome was reduced in advancing generations and this was coupled in some cases with a reduction of incompatibility. However, the S. peruvianum genome was almost completely represented among the different plants of the most advanced generations. ILs will be basically developed from them. Some of the generations developed were resistant to TYLCV and TSWV.	2013	10.1007/s10681-013-0896-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Kalia, P.; Muthukumar, P.; Soi, S.; Shilpi	Marker-assisted introgression of the Or gene for enhancing beta-carotene content in Indian cauliflower	IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOLECULAR MARKERS IN HORTICULTURE	Among micronutrients, vitamin A is essential for vision; its deficiency leads to night blindness, which is the most prominent malnutrition problem in India. Since cauliflower is grown and consumed extensively all year round in India, but is deficient in vitamin A, it was identified as a preferred crop for biofortification in order to address a malnutrition problem in the country. We report on the introgression of the beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A)-enhancing Or gene from donor line EC625883 into Indian cauliflower 'Pusa Sharad' (DC 309) and the parents of 'Pusa Hybrid-2' (CC-35 and DC 18-19). The sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker SA4 was utilized for foreground selection in the 'Pusa Sharad' (DC 309) x EC625883 BC1F1 cross. A total of 1013 PCR-based markers were used for a polymorphic survey among parents, with 6.81% being polymorphic between 'Pusa Sharad' and EC625883, 6.91% between CC-35 and EC625883, and 6.71% between DC 18-19 and EC625883. Background analysis showed a maximum recovery of the recurrent parent genome (RPG) to the level of 72%. The beta-carotene content of BC1F1 plants of the dark-orange category was 2.03-14.64 mu g g(-1) (DC 309 x EC625883), 7.03-15.99 mu g g(-1) (CC-35 x EC625883) and 4.52-18.60 mu g g(-1) (DC 18-19 x EC625883). The combination of high RPG and beta-carotene content was recorded in two plants, 18-19-1-7-7 (18.60 mu g g(-1)) and 18-19-1-3-6 (17.94 mu g g(-1)). Promising lines showing more than 10 mu g g(-1) beta-carotene in BC1F1 were advanced to BC1F2 and BC2F1.	2018	10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1203.19		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Kalia, P.; Sharma, B. B.; Singh, D.	Marker-assisted introgression of black-rot resistance gene Xca1bc into cauliflower through interspecific hybridization	IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOLECULAR MARKERS IN HORTICULTURE	Black rot is an important bacterial disease of Brassica vegetables throughout the world, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). This disease takes a heavy toll of cole crops, causing yield losses of 10-50%. Since there is lack of black-rot resistance in Brassica oleracea (C genome), exploration of other Brassica species in the Uthant triangle is necessary, as they are supposed to be potential reservoirs of genes for black-rot disease resistance. Resistance to black-rot disease in Brassica carinata NPC-9, governed by a single dominant gene, is flanked by markers At1g70610 and At1g71865 on linkage group B-7. To introgress this resistance into cauliflower, an interspecific hybrid and its backcross progeny (B-1) were generated between cauliflower 'Pusa Sharad' and Ethiopian mustard NPC-9 using in-vitro embryo rescue techniques. Hybridity confirmation of F-1 interspecific plants was carried out with a co-dominant simple sequence repeat marker (NI2-C01) and Brassica B and C genome-specific primers DB and DC. The F-1 interspecific plants showed resistance on artificial inoculation with Xcc race 1. Segregation distortion was observed in BC1 generation for black-rot resistance. Successful introgression of black-rot resistance in the interspecific BC1 generation was confirmed by At1g70610 marker analysis. This paper reports marker-assisted introgression of B genome-specific Xcc resistance from B. carinata to cauliflower through embryo rescue technique.	2018	10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1203.8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Kalia, Pritam; Mangal, Manisha; Singh, Shrawan; Chugh, Chetna; Mishra, Sheshnath; Chaudhary, Shivpratap	Morphological and molecular changes on cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) introgression in Asiatic carrot (Daucus carota L.)	PLANTA	Main conclusionPetaloid' cytoplasmic male sterility is commonly used as a stable genetic mechanism in carrot hybrid breeding. Its introgression in tropical carrot showed morphometric changes and molecular markers were identified for detection at early stage.AbstractCytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is the only genetic mechanism in carrot for commercial exploitation of heterosis and production of low cost affordable hybrid seeds. The petaloid' CMS system is stable and commonly used in hybrid breeding in temperate carrot but there is no information available on existence of natural CMS system in tropical Asiatic carrot. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate morphometric traits and organizational features of cytoplasmic atp9 gene sequences in newly converted CMS lines (BC4-7) of tropical carrot. The CMS lines had root traits at par with fertile counterparts while floral traits had variation. Petal colour and length, petaloids colour and shape and style length showed differences among the CMS lines and with their maintainers. Molecular markers are effective to establish male sterility at genetic level, for this, six fixed and stable CMS lines were screened with seven novel primer combinations. Out of which five pairs produced clearly distinguishable bands in CMS lines and their fertile counterparts. The study confirmed that the region between 3 ' end of atp9-1/atp9-3 gene and 5 ' end of region of homology to Arabidopsis thaliana mtDNA is ideal for developing the trait specific markers. These new CMS lines have potential to use in hybrid development and molecular markers will be useful to confirm male sterility to rogue out fertile plants.	2019	10.1007/s00425-019-03185-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Kang, Lei; Du, Xuezhu; Zhou, Yingying; Zhu, Bin; Ge, Xianhong; Li, Zaiyun	Development of a complete set of monosomic alien addition lines between Brassica napus and Isatis indigotica (Chinese woad)	PLANT CELL REPORTS	A complete set of monosomic alien addition lines of Brassica napus with one of the seven chromosomes of Isatis indigotica and the recombinant mitochondria was developed and characterized. Monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) are valuable for elucidating the genome structure and transferring the useful genes and traits in plant breeding. Isatis indigotica (Chinese woad, 2n = 14, II) in Isatideae tribe of Brassicaceae family has been widely cultivated as a medicinal and dye plant in China. Herein, the intertribal somatic hybrid (2n = 52, AACCII) between B. napus cv. Huashuang 3 (2n = 38, AACC) and I. indigotica produced previously was backcrossed recurrently to parental B. napus, and 32 MAAL plants were isolated. Based on their phenotype, 5S and 45S rDNA loci and chromosome-specific SSR markers, these MAALs were classified into seven groups corresponding to potential seven types of MAALs carrying one of the seven I. indigotica chromosomes. One of the MAALs could be distinguishable by expressing the brown anthers of I. indigotica, other two hosted the chromosome with 5S or 45S rDNA locus, but the remaining four were identifiable by SSR markers. The simultaneous detection of the same SSR maker and gene locus in different MAALs revealed the paralogs on the chromosomes involved. The recombinant mitochondrial genome in MAALs was likely related with their male sterility with carpellody stamens, while the MAAL with normal brown anthers probably carried the restoring gene for the male sterility. The complete set of MAALs should be useful for exploiting the I. indigotica genome and for promoting the introgression of valuable genes to B. napus.	2014	10.1007/s00299-014-1621-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Kantartzi, Stella K.; Roupakias, Demetrios G.	In vitro gynogenesis in cotton (Gossypium sp.)	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE	The effects of genotype, pollen or growth regulator-pretreatment of pistils, developmental stage of the ovule (embryo sac) and culture media on induction of gynogenesis, and subsequent plantlet regeneration in vitro were assessed in interspecific Gossypium barbadense x G. hirsutum cotton hybrids. Gynogenesis occurred in all genotypes used when the pistils had been pre-treated with pollen from Hibiscus cannabinus and ovaries were harvested 5 or 10 days after anthesis. The use of culture media, SH and MS, showed no significant differences in responding ovules, embryogenic ovules or embryo germination frequency. Recovered progeny were characterized cytogenetically and microscopically to help documenting their reproductive basis. Root tip chromosome counts of 17 plants established from ovule culture revealed that chromosome numbers ranged from 27 to 44. Although the reproductive mechanisms need to be characterized more extensively by cytological and molecular means, the observations suggest that gynogenesis in cotton involves some unusual reproductive events. Aneuploids could be useful for functional genomic characterization of genome shock, deletion mapping, and germplasm introgression.	2009	10.1007/s11240-008-9459-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Kantartzi, Stella; Roupakias, D. G.	Production of aneuploids of the cotton hybrid G-barbadense x G-hirsutum L. via intergeneric pollination with Abelmoschus esculentus	EUPHYTICA	The possibility to induce embryo development after pollination of F-1 interspecific cotton hybrids (Gossypium barbadense x Gossypium. hirsutum) with pollen from Abelmoschus esculentus was investigated to determine if wide-cross hybrid, haploid or other types of progeny might result. Small numbers of progeny (Pa) were indeed recovered after numerous alien pollinations and in-planta development or in-vitro culture. The Pa plants were characterized phenotypically and studied cytogenetically and microscopically to help establish their origin documenting their reproductive basis. Root-tip chromosome counts and meiotic Metaphase-I analyses revealed that chromosome numbers among cells of the Pa plants ranged from 33 to 44 and that the differences in chromosome number among cells of the same plant ranged from 1 to 3, indicating somatic instability. Flow cytometric analysis also indicated the aneuploid nature of Pa plants. Although the reproductive mechanisms need to be characterized more extensively by cytological and molecular means, the observations suggest that alien pollinations may have resulted in parthenogenetic (Pa) egg cell development, or some other unusual reproductive events. The production of wide-crosses and high degrees of aneuploidy could be of use for several types of genomic studies, e.g., functional genomic characterization of genome shock, deletion mapping, and germplasm introgression.	2008	10.1007/s10681-007-9550-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Kartal, Gulcin K.; Senbek, Gozde; Karaca, Mehmet; Acikgoz, Esvet	Hybridization studies in Vicia sativa complex	EUPHYTICA	Some species in Vicia sativa complex, also called aggregate (C-VS), have economic and ecological advantages and they are frequently used for pasture, silage, and green manure. The main objective of this study was to explore the secondary gene pool for enhancement of common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) germplasm by genome introgressions via conventional crosses made between cultivated common vetch (Vicia sativa L. subspecies sativa) used as female parent with five other subspecies [amphicarpa (L.), Batt., cordata (Wulfen ex Hoppe) Asch. & Graebner, macrocarpa (Moris) Arcang., nigra (L.) Ehrh., and segetalis (Thuill.)], used as male parents. As indicated with very low seed sets, higher levels of sterility were the rule in hybrids in C-VS. Hybrids were confirmed using flower petal color and anthocyanin pigmentation markers. Chromosome count studies revealed that certain crossing-experiments were successfully produced interspecific hybrids. Certain offspring progenies in further generations were also obtained. Our studies clearly indicated that complex C-VS and hybrids obtained from these species consisted of 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 pair of somatic chromosomes. Results indicated that there exist significant incompatibility alleles possibly expressing in the zygote or post-zygotic developmental stages within the C-VS. In conclusion, present study revealed that sufficient amount of seeds could be obtained from the crosses in the C-VS and this stimulates renewed interest in utilizing the secondary gene pool as a source of genetic variation in breeding programs of common vetch.	2020	10.1007/s10681-020-2566-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE

Combining Ascochyta blight and Botrytis grey mould resistance in chickpea through interspecific hybridization	PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA	Ascochyta blight (AB) caused by Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Labr. and Botrytis grey mould (BGM) caused by Botrytis cinerea (Pers. ex Fr.) are important diseases of the aerial plant parts of chickpea in most chickpea growing areas of the world. Although conventional approaches have contributed to reducing disease, the use of new technologies is expected to further reduce losses through these biotic stresses. Reliable screening techniques were developed: 'field screening technique' for adult plant screening, 'cloth chamber technique' and 'growth chamber technique' for the study of races of the pathogen and for segregating generations. Furthermore, the 'cut twig technique' for interspecific population for AB and BGM resistance was developed. For introgression of high levels of AB and BGM resistance in cultivated chickpea from wild relatives, accessions of seven annual wild Cicer spp. were evaluated and identified: C. judaicum accessions 185, ILWC 95 and ILWC 61, C. pinnatifidum accessions 188, 199 and ILWC 212 as potential donors. C. pinnatifidum accession188 was crossed with ICCV 96030 and 62 F-9 lines resistant to AB and BGM were derived. Of the derived lines, several are being evaluated for agronomic traits and yield parameters while four lines, GL 29029, GL29206, GL29212, GL29081 possessing high degree of resistance were crossed with susceptible high yielding cultivars BG 256 to improve resistance and to undertake molecular studies. Genotyping of F-2 populations with SSR markers from the chickpea genome was done to identify markers potentially linked with AB and BGM resistance genes. In preliminary studies, of 120 SSR markers used, six (Ta 2, Ta 110, Ta 139, CaSTMS 7, CaSTMS 24 and Tr 29) were identified with polymorphic bands between resistant derivative lines and the susceptible parent. The study shows that wild species of Cicer are the valuable gene pools of resistance to AB and BGM. The resistant derivative lines generated here can serve as good pre-breeding material and markers identified can assist in marker assisted selection for resistance breeding.	2013			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Kawabe, Akira; Nukii, Hiroaki; Furihata, Hazuka Y.	Exploring the History of Chloroplast Capture in Arabis Using Whole Chloroplast Genome Sequencing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES	Chloroplast capture occurs when the chloroplast of one plant species is introgressed into another plant species. The phylogenies of nuclear and chloroplast markers from East Asian Arabis species are incongruent, which indicates hybrid origin and shows chloroplast capture. In the present study, the complete chloroplast genomes of A. hirsuta, A. nipponica, and A. flagellosa were sequenced in order to analyze their divergence and their relationships. The chloroplast genomes of A. nipponica and A. flagellosa were similar, which indicates chloroplast replacement. If hybridization causing chloroplast capture occurred once, divergence between recipient species would be lower than between donor species. However, the chloroplast genomes of species with possible hybrid origins, A. nipponica and A. stelleri, differ at similar levels to possible maternal donor species A. flagellosa, which suggests that multiple hybridization events have occurred in their respective histories. The mitochondrial genomes exhibited similar patterns, while A. nipponica and A. flagellosa were more similar to each other than to A. hirsuta. This suggests that the two organellar genomes were co-transferred during the hybridization history of the East Asian Arabis species.	2018	10.3390/ijms19020602		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression measured via chloroplast similarity	FALSE			FALSE	
Kelley, K. B.; Whitworth, J. L.; Novy, R. G.	Mapping of the potato leafroll virus resistance gene, Rlr (etb) , from Solanum etuberosum identifies interchromosomal translocations among its E-genome chromosomes 4 and 9 relative to the A-genome of Solanum L. sect. Petota	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Gene Rlr (etb) , derived from the potato species Solanum etuberosum, confers resistance to potato leafroll virus (PLRV). Mapping of this gene would aid in developing marker-assisted selection protocols to facilitate its introgression into cultivated potato. One RFLP marker and 45 cleaved amplified polymorphic markers (CAPs) markers were used to screen an etuberosum-derived BC3 family segregating for PLRV resistance conferred by Rlr (etb) . Nine markers from linkage group 4 of the tomato map displayed linkage with Rlr (etb) , however, eight additional markers from linkage group 4 that should have been syntenic with Rlr (etb) were not. Instead they segregated with 12 markers previously mapped to linkage group 9 of the tomato map, indicative that chromosomes 4 and 9 of S. etuberosum have translocated regions relative to the potato and tomato genomes. These chromosomal translocations have placed Rlr (etb) beyond the end of the published map of linkage group 4 of tomato with the closest marker, C2_At1g42990, mapping 13.6 cM from Rlr (etb) .	2009	10.1007/s11032-008-9251-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Khan, Nadeem; Barba-Gonzalez, Rodrigo; Ramanna, M. S.; Arens, Paul; Visser, Richard G. F.; Van Tuyl, Jaap M.	Relevance of unilateral and bilateral sexual polyploidization in relation to intergenomic recombination and introgression in Lilium species hybrids	EUPHYTICA	Sexual polyploids were induced in diploid (2n = 2x = 24) interspecific F1 hybrids of Longiflorum x Asiatic (LA) and Oriental x Asiatic (OA) Lilium hybrids by backcrossing to Asiatic (AA) parents as well as by sib-mating of the F1 LA hybrids. A majority of the BC1 progenies were triploid and the progenies from sib-mating were tetraploid or near tetraploids. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique was applied to assess the intergenomic recombination in the BC1 populations of LA and OA hybrids obtained after unilateral sexual polyploidization. A total of 63 LA (LA x AA and AA x LA) and 53 OA hybrids were analysed. LA hybrids were originated through the functioning of 2n gametes either as 2n eggs or 2n pollen while those of OA hybrids originated through functional 2n pollen of diploid OA genotype. In both type of crosses, a majority of the progenies had originated through First Division Restitution (FDR) mechanism of functional 2n gamete either with or without a cross over. However, there were nine LA- and four OA-genotypes where Indeterminate Meiotic Restitution (IMR) was the mechanism of 2n gamete formation. Based on GISH, total amount of introgression of Longiflorum and Oriental genome into Asiatic genome was determined. Most of the BC progenies exhibited recombination and the amount of recombination was higher in LA hybrids as compared to OA hybrids. Intergenomic recombination was also determined cytologically in the 16 plants of sib-mated LA hybrids where both parents had contributed 2n gametes. Based on these results the nature of interspecific lily hybrids obtained from uni- and bilateral sexual polyploidization leading to allotriploid and allotetraploid formation is discussed in the context of introgression and intergenomic recombination.	2010	10.1007/s10681-009-9998-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Khan, Nadeem; Barba-Gonzalez, Rodrigo; Ramanna, M. S.; Visser, Richard G. F.; Van Tuyl, Jaap M.	Construction of chromosomal recombination maps of three genomes of lilies (Lilium) based on GISH analysis	GENOME	Chromosomal recombination maps were constructed for three genomes of lily (Lilium) using GISH analyses. For this purpose, the backcross (BC) progenies of two diploid (2n = 2x = 24) interspecific hybrids of lily, viz. Longiflorum x Asiatic (LA) and Oriental x Asiatic (OA), were used. Mostly the BC progenies of LA hybrids consisted of both triploid (2n = 3x = 36) and diploid (2n = 2x = 24) with some aneuploid genotypes and those of OA hybrids consisted of triploid (2n = 3x = 36) and some aneuploid genotypes. In all cases, it was possible to identify the homoeologous recombinant chromosomes as well as accurately count the number of crossover points, which are called "recombination sites''. Recombination sites were estimated in the BC progeny of 71 LA and 41 OA genotypes. In the case of BC progenies of LA hybrids, 248 recombination sites were cytologically localized on 12 different chromosomes of each genome (i.e., L and A). Similarly, 116 recombinant sites were localized on the 12 chromosomes each from the BC progenies of OA hybrids (O and A genomes). Cytological maps were constructed on the basis of the percentages of distances (micrometres) of the recombination sites from the centromeres. Since an Asiatic parent was involved in both hybrids, viz. LA and OA, two maps were constructed for the A genome that were indicated as Asiatic (L) and Asiatic (O). The other two maps were Longiflorum (A) and Oriental (A). Remarkably, the recombination sites were highly unevenly distributed among the different chromosomes of all four maps. Because the recombination sites can be unequivocally identified through GISH, they serve as reliable landmarks and pave the way for assigning molecular markers or desirable genes to chromosomes of Lilium and also monitor introgression of alien segments.	2009	10.1139/G08-122		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Khan, Nadeem; Zhou, Shujun; Ramanna, M. S.; Arens, Paul; Herrera, Jeronimo; Visser, Richard G. F.; Van Tuyl, Jaap M.	Potential for analytic breeding in allopolyploids: an illustration from Longiflorum x Asiatic hybrid lilies (Lilium)	EUPHYTICA	Ploidy level and intergenomic recombination was studied in interspecific hybrids between Longiflorum x Asiatic lilies (LA hybrid) backcross to Asiatic parents in order to assess the possibility for analytic breeding in lily. By backcrossing the diploid (2n = 2x = 24) F1 interspecific hybrid between Longiflorum x Asiatic lilies to Asiatic parents, 104 BC1 progeny plants were produced. Among these, there were 27 diploids, 73 triploids (2n = 2x = 36) and 4 aneuploids (2x - 1, 2x + 2 or 2x + 3). In addition, by backcrossing triploid BC1 (LAA) plants to diploid Asiatic parents in 2x - 3x and reciprocal combinations, 14 diploid BC2 progenies were produced. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was performed to study the intergenomic recombination and karyotype composition. GISH indicated extensive intergenomic recombination among the chromosomes in LA hybrids. A large number of Longiflorum chromosomes were transmitted to the BC1 progenies from LA hybrids. However, very few Longiflorum chromosomes were transmitted from the BC1 triploid (LAA) plants to the BC2 progenies. The occurrence of diploid plants in the BC progenies of LA hybrids has opened the prospects of analytic breeding in lilies. In this approach, the selection of superior genotypes can be carried out at the diploid level and polyploid forms are synthesized from superior diploid parents. The advantages of analytic breeding are evident: (a) a maximum level of heterozygosity can be attained in the synthetic polyploids and (b) introgression can be achieved with a minimum of linkage drag. Based on GISH results the potential application of analytic breeding in lily allopolyploids has been discussed.	2009	10.1007/s10681-008-9824-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Khan, R.; Khan, H.; Farhatullah; Harada, K.	Evaluation of microsatellite markers to discriminate induced mutation lines, hybrid lines and cultigens in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L)	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE	A total of 47 chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) accessions including 21 induced mutation lines, 17 hybrid lines, 5 local cultigens, and 4 non-nodulating lines were examined for their growth characteristics in the field. Genotypes of these accessions were also examined using 10 SSR (microsatellite) markers. Eight of the 10 markers were polymorphic and the number of alleles ranged from 2 to 16, with the average of 7.4 per locus. PIC values ranged from 0.227 to 0.876, with an average of 0.636. The accessions comprised 29 Desi and 18 Kabuli phenotypes. The average PIC was 0.582 in Desi and 0.577 in Kabuli phenotypes. Significant genetic differentiation was revealed between Desi and Kabuli phenotypes by AMOVA under stepwise mutation assumption (R-ST = 0.239, P <= 0.001). A considerable amount of genetic variation was observed in the mutation accumulation lines tested. PIC for the accessions derived from the Desi parental line C-44 was 0.443 and that of Pb-91 was 0.422, which accounts for about 66 to 70% of the total variation within our collection, respectively. UPGMA and ME trees classified the accessions into 6 groups and all but 6 accessions could be clearly separated. Grouping was mostly the same in the two phylogenetic trees, but the branching order differed greatly. Recent introgression among the parental lines is suggested for this reason. Our study indicates that SSR markers are useful tools for discriminating induced mutation lines as well as hybrid lines.	2010			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Khrustaleva, Ludmila; Kudryavtseva, Natalia; Romanov, Dmitry; Ermolaev, Aleksey; Kirov, Ilya	Comparative Tyramide-FISH mapping of the genes controlling flavor and bulb color in Allium species revealed an altered gene order	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	Evolutionarily related species often share a common order of genes along homeologous chromosomes. Here we report the collinearity disruption of genes located on homeologous chromosome 4 in Allium species. Ultra-sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization with tyramide signal amplification (tyr-FISH) allowed the visualization of the alliinase multigene family, chalcon synthase gene and EST markers on Allium cepa and Allium fistulosum chromosomes. In A. cepa, bulb alliinase, root alliinase (ALL1) and chalcon synthase (CHS-B) genes were located in the long arm but EST markers (API18 and ACM082) were located in the short arm. In A. fistulosum, all the visualized genes and markers were located in the short arm. Moreover, root alliinase genes (ALL1 and AOB249) showed contrast patterns in number of loci. We suppose that the altered order of the genes/markers is the result of a large pericentric inversion. To get insight into the evolution of the chromosome rearrangement, we mapped the bulb alliinase gene in phylogenetically close and distant species. In the taxonomic clade including A. fistulosum, A. altaicum, A. oschaninii and A. pskemense and in phylogenetically distant species A. roylei and A. nutans, the bulb alliinase gene was located on the short arm of chromosome 4 while, in A. cepa and A. schoenoprasum, the bulb alliinase gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 4. These results have encouraging implications for the further tracing of inverted regions in meiosis of interspecific hybrids and studding chromosome evolution. Also, this finding may have a practical benefit as closely related species are actively used for improving onion crop stock.	2019	10.1038/s41598-019-48564-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	identifying structural genome differences btw species 	FALSE			FALSE

Introgression of Aegilops speltoides segments in Triticum aestivum and the effect of the gametocidal genes	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has been through a severe genetic bottleneck as a result of its evolution and domestication. It is therefore essential that new sources of genetic variation are generated and utilized. This study aimed to generate genome-wide introgressed segments from Aegilops speltoides. Introgressions generated from this research will be made available for phenotypic analysis. Methods Aegilops speltoides was crossed as the male parent to T. aestivum 'Paragon'. The interspecific hybrids were then backcrossed to Paragon. Introgressions were detected and characterized using the Affymetrix Axiom Array and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Key Results Recombination in the gametes of the F 1 hybrids was at a level where it was possible to generate a genetic linkage map of Ae. speltoides. This was used to identify 294 wheat/Ae. speltoides introgressions. Introgressions from all seven linkage groups of Ae. speltoides were found, including both large and small segments. Comparative analysis showed that overall macro-synteny is conserved between Ae. speltoides and T. aestivum, but that Ae. speltoides does not contain the 4A/5A/7B translocations present in wheat. Aegilops speltoides has been reported to carry gametocidal genes, i. e. genes that ensure their transmission through the gametes to the next generation. Transmission rates of the seven Ae. speltoides linkage groups introgressed into wheat varied. A 100 % transmission rate of linkage group 2 demonstrates the presence of the gametocidal genes on this chromosome. Conclusions A high level of recombination occurs between the chromosomes of wheat and Ae. speltoides, leading to the generation of large numbers of introgressions with the potential for exploitation in breeding programmes. Due to the gametocidal genes, all germplasm developed will always contain a segment from Ae. speltoides linkage group 2S, in addition to an introgression from any other linkage group.	2018	10.1093/aob/mcx149		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

A step change in the transfer of interspecific variation into wheat from Amblyopyrum muticum	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL	Despite some notable successes, only a fraction of the genetic variation available in wild relatives has been utilized to produce superior wheat varieties. This is as a direct result of the lack of availability of suitable high-throughput technologies to detect wheat/wild relative introgressions when they occur. Here, we report on the use of a new SNP array to detect wheat/wild relative introgressions in backcross progenies derived from interspecific hexaploid wheat/Ambylopyrum muticum F-1 hybrids. The array enabled the detection and characterization of 218 genomewide wheat/Am. muticum introgressions, that is a significant step change in the generation and detection of introgressions compared to previous work in the field. Furthermore, the frequency of introgressions detected was sufficiently high to enable the construction of seven linkage groups of the Am. muticum genome, thus enabling the syntenic relationship between the wild relative and hexaploid wheat to be determined. The importance of the genetic variation from Am. muticum introduced into wheat for the development of superior varieties is discussed.	2017	10.1111/pbi.12606		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines/methods dev to make them	FALSE			FALSE

Characterisation and inheritance of nuclear microsatellite loci for use in population studies of the allotetraploid Salix alba-Salix fragilis complex	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	We present nine polymorphic di- and tri-nucleotide repeat nuclear microsatellite markers selected specifically for their use in high throughput studies concerning the dioecious allotetraploid Salix alba-Salix fragilis willow complex. These taxa and their hybrids are difficult to discriminate using morphological characters. Thus, multiplex reactions were developed for these microsatellite loci and their effectiveness to distinguish individuals, especially hybrids, and their inheritance patterns in controlled crosses were determined. All loci displayed disomic-monogenic inheritance which allowed for the genotype data to be analysed as for a diploid organism. The nine loci produced a total of 67 alleles (mean, 7.4 alleles per locus; range, 3-11 alleles) in a reference panel of 57 individuals from two germplasm collections and natural populations. Gene diversity values (as measured by the expected heterozygosity) ranged from 0.000-0.820. A total of 53 distinct multilocus genotypes were observed, and ordination analysis revealed three separate clusters corresponding to S. alba, S. fragilis and hybrids. The microsatellite loci described here will be used in population genetic studies to investigate genetic variation, gene flow, levels of hybridisation and the extent of introgression in natural populations of the S. alba-S. fragilis complex. They are also useful for clonal identification, conservation and sustainable management of germplasm collections, genetic mapping and the selection of individuals and/or certification of controlled crosses for breeding programmes.	2010	10.1007/s11295-009-0245-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker dev	FALSE			FALSE

In plants, the Rabl's configuration, with telomeres at one pole of nucleus and centromeres at the other, appears to be common, at least in plants with large genomes. It is unclear whether individual chromosomes of plants adopt defined, genetically determined addresses within the nucleus, as is the case in mammals. In this study, the nuclear disposition of alien rye and barley chromosomes and chromosome arm introgressions into wheat while using 3D-FISH in various somatic tissues was analyzed. All of the introgressed chromosomes showed Rabl's orientation, but their relative positions in the nuclei were less clear. While in most cases pairs of introgressed chromosomes occupied discrete positions, their association (proximity) along their entire lengths was rare, and partial association only marginally more frequent. This arrangement is relatively stable in various tissues and during various stages of the cell cycle. On the other hand, the length of a chromosome arm appears to play a role in its positioning in a nucleus: shorter chromosomes or chromosome arms tend to be located closer to the centre of the nucleus, while longer arms are more often positioned at the nuclear periphery.	2019	10.3390/ijms20174143		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Kopecky, D; Lukaszewski, AJ; Dolezel, J	Genomic constitution of Festulolium cultivars released in the Czech Republic	PLANT BREEDING	Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to characterize the chromosome constitutions of individual plants from a set of tetraploid and hexaploid cultivars of Festulolium developed and released in the Czech Republic from hybrids of Lolium multiflorum with Festuca pratensis and F. arundinacea. A simplified GISH protocol readily discriminated parental genomes in the hybrids and facilitated the screening of large numbers of plants per accession. The contribution of parental genomes in the cultivars tested ranged from predominance of chromatin from one of the parents to a more balanced contribution from both parents. However, in none of the cultivars were equal proportions of chromatin from both parents present. The parental contribution to the hybrids was both in the form of complete chromosomes or as chromosome translocations. In hexaploid cultivars from (L. multiflorum x F. arundinacea) x F. arundinacea hybrids the average numbers of complete L. multiflorum chromosomes ranged from 4.95 to 7.5 and the numbers of translocations from 6.33 to 10.21. Two tetraploid cultivars from (L. multiflorum x F. arundinacea) x L. multiflorum hybrids showed a strong prevalence of L. multiflorum chromatin and intergeneric translocations were rare. In the tetraploid cultivar 'Perun' of the L. multiflorum x F. pratensis hybrid there were 11.7 chromosomes of L. multiflorum and 14.7 recombined chromosomes on average. Reasons for the domination of one of the parental genomes in hybrid cultivars are not clear and are only partially explained by breeding history. Recombination rates of individual genomes in hybrids involving F. arundinacea were evaluated in double hybridization experiments. The results indicated a strong affinity of the L. multiflorum genome for the F. pratensis genome present in F. arundinacea and little affinity for the F. glaucescens genome. This suggests that introgressions from F. arundinacea into L. multiflorum are primarily limited to the F. pratensis genome which can be more readily accessed in L. multiflorum x F. pratensis hybrids.	2005	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2005.01127.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Chromosome pairing of individual genomes in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), its progenitors, and hybrids with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	A diploid-like pairing system prevents meiotic irregularities and improves the efficiency of gamete production in allo-polyploid species. While the nature of the system is known in some polyploid crops including wheat, little is known about the control of chromosome pairing in polyploid fescues (Festuca spp.). In this work we studied chromosome pairing in allohexaploid F. arundinacea, its progenitors F. pratensis and F. glaucescens, and two intergeneric hybrids Lolium multiflorum (2x) x F. arundinacea (6x) and L. multiflorum (4x) x F. glaucescens (4x). The use of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) permitted the analysis of homoeologous chromosome pairing and recombination of different genomes involved. We detected a diploid-like pairing system in polyploid fescues F. arundinacea and F. glaucescens, the latter being one of the progenitors of F. arundinacea. The pairing control system was absent in the second progenitor F. pratensis. Detailed analysis of intergeneric hybrids confirmed the presumed haploinsufficiency of the fescue system, which resulted in homoeologous pairing between all component genomes. This indicates that introgression of any specific chromosome segment from one genome to another is possible in all genome combinations. Our results not only contribute to the quest to discover the nature of the system controlling chromosome pairing in polyploid fescues, but may also have serious implications for design of hybrid breeding schemes in forage grasses.

Physical Distribution of Homoeologous Recombination in Individual Chromosomes of Festuca pratensis in Lolium multiflorum	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Crossing over-based recombination is a powerful tool for generating new allelic combinations during sexual reproduction. It usually occurs between homologous chromosomes. However, under some conditions, homoeologues may also be capable of crossing over. Whether homologous and homoeologous crossovers are equivalent and governed by the same rules has never been established. Here we report on chromosome distribution of homoeologous crossovers in a unique system of Festuca X Lolium hybrids. Unlike in most other hybrids, in these intergeneric hybrids, homoeologous chromosomes are capable of pairing and crossing over with frequencies approaching that of homologues. At the same time, genome divergence makes cytological detection of chromosome recombination feasible. We analyzed the distribution of homoeologous recombination along individual chromosomes in a complete set of intergeneric single chromosome substitutions from F. pratensis into tetraploid L. multiflorum. Homoeologous recombination sites were not evenly distributed along the chromosomes, being concentrated in intercalary regions of the arms and reduced in proximal and distal regions. Several recombination hotspots and cold spots were found along individual chromosomes and the recombination was not affected by the presence of a secondary constriction. Our results indicate that despite the uneven distribution of homoeologous recombination, introgression of any part of the F. pratensis genome into L. multiflorum is feasible. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

Kopecky, D.; Lukaszewski, A. J.; Dolezel, J.	Meiotic behaviour of individual chromosomes of Festuca pratensis in tetraploid Lolium multiflorum	CHROMOSOME RESEARCH	Intergeneric hybrids of fescues (Festuca spp.) and ryegrasses (Lolium spp.) are unique for the ability of their chromosomes to pair essentially freely in meiotic metaphase I (MI). At the same time, their chromosomes can be readily recognized by genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH). Past genome-wide observations suggested that this homoeologous pairing was not completely random. In this study we extend the analysis to all seven individual chromosomes of F. pratensis introgressed into autotetraploid L. multiflorum and show that for any F. pratensis chromosome the choice of an MI pairing partner depends on the identity of the remaining chromosomes present in the quadruplet. In monosomic introgressions, the choice of a homologous or homoeologous partner was completely random; in disomics there was a slight preference for homologous pairing. Pairing preference was similar for each chromosome, suggesting that pairing affinity of all chromosomes is essentially the same and no structural rearrangements differentiate the two genera. Homoeologous crossover rates for individual chromosomes were similar and they were consistently lower than expected on the basis of the MI pairing. High homoeologous MI pairing in these hybrids may be due to a very permissive system of chromosome pairing control that overlooks differences between the parental chromosomes. Given the ease of genome discrimination by GISH in the Lolium-Festuca hybrids, the differences in repetitive DNA sequences must be substantial. On the other hand, it appears just as likely that while the DNA repeats diverged markedly during evolution, the sequences involved in chromosome pairing have been conserved enough to facilitate regular pairing partner recognition and crossing-over.	2008	10.1007/s10577-008-1256-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Species from the two genera display complementary agronomic characteristics and are often grown in mixtures. Breeding efforts to combine desired features in single entities culminated with the production of Festuca X Lolium hybrids. The so called Festuloliums enjoy a considerable commercial success with numerous cultivars registered all over the world. They are also very intriguing from a strictly cytogenetic point of view as the parental chromosomes recombine freely in hybrids. Until a decade ago this phenomenon was only known in general quantitative terms. The introduction of molecular cytogenetic tools such as FISH and GISH permitted detailed studies of intergeneric chromosome recombination and karyotyping of Festulolium cultivars. These tools were also invaluable in revealing the origin of polyploid fescues, and facilitated the development of chromosome substitution and introgression lines and physical mapping of traits of interest. Further progress in this area will require the development of a larger set of cytogenetic markers and high-resolution cytogenetic maps. It is expected that the Lolium - Festuca complex will continue providing opportunities for breeding superior grass cultivars and the complex will remain an attractive platform for fundamental research of the early steps of hybrid speciation and interaction of parental genomes, as well as the processes of chromosome pairing, elimination and recombination.

The DArTFest array contains 7,680 probes derived from methyl-filtered genomic representations. Of 3,884 polymorphic DArT markers identified in the first marker discovery experiment, over 1,000 markers detected a positive allele in each species. We assigned DArT markers to individual chromosome regions of F pratensis using a series of single chromosome substitution and recombinant lines of F pratensis in L. multiflorum. Moreover, we enriched the existing genetic map of F. pratensis by over 200 DArT markers and existing genetic map of L. multiflorum by over 500 DArT markers. The resources developed in this project will facilitate development of genetic maps in Festuca and Lolium, the analysis of genomic constitution in Festuca x Lolium hybrids, as well as marker-assisted selection for multiple traits.	2010	10.1007/978-90-481-8706-5_65		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Kopecky, David; Horakova, Lucie; Duchoslav, Martin; Dolezel, Jaroslav	Selective Elimination of Parental Chromatin from Introgression Cultivars of xFestulolium (Festuca x Lolium)	SUSTAINABILITY	Alien chromosome introgressions can be used to introduce beneficial traits from one species into another. However, exploitation of the introgressions in breeding requires proper transmission of introgressed segments to consecutive generations. In xFestulolium hybrids chromosomes of Festuca and Lolium readily pair and recombine. This opens a way for introgression of traits (e.g., abiotic and biotic stress resistance) from Festuca into elite Lolium cultivars. However, retention of Festuca chromatin in xFestulolium is uncertain as several studies indicated its gradual elimination over generations of sexual reproduction. Here we investigated genome composition in two subsequent generations of four introgression xFestulolium (F. pratensis x L. multiflorum) cultivars using genomic in situ hybridization. We observed about 27-32% elimination of Festuca chromatin in a single round of multiplication. At this pace, Festuca chromatin would be completely eliminated in about four generations of seed multiplication. On the other hand, we observed that it is possible to increase the proportion of Festuca chromatin in the cultivars by proper selection of mating plants. Nevertheless, once selection is relaxed, the first round of the seed multiplication reverts the genome composition back to the Lolium type. Thus, it seems that amphiploid forms of xFestulolium with relatively stable hybrid genomes may be more promising material for future breeding than introgression lines.	2019	10.3390/su11113153		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Kopecky, David; Talukder, Shyamal K.; Zwyrtkova, Jana; Trammell, Mike; Dolezel, Jaroslav; Saha, Malay C.	Inter-morphotype hybridization in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.): exploration of meiotic irregularities and potential for breeding	EUPHYTICA	The Continental morphotype of tall fescue is one of the main forage and turf grass species. However, it suffers from summer drought, especially in dry and hot climates. On the other hand, the Mediterranean morphotype of tall fescue display summer dormancy. Hybridization of the two morphotypes seems to be an efficient way to introgress summer dormancy from Mediterranean morphotypes into elite cultivars of the Continental morphotype. In this study, we performed a series of reciprocal crosses producing F1 hybrids. Phenotyping revealed heterosis for plant height, fresh weight and dry matter yield, with hybrids generally outscoring parental genotypes. On the other hand, F1 hybrids had reduced fertility and lower seed set. This was a consequence of meiotic irregularities. Both parental morphotypes carry chromosome pairing regulators responsible for diploid-like behavior in meiosis. However, it is clear from this study that the regulators from the two morphotypes are not compatible. We observed high frequency of multivalent formation and homoeologous chromosome pairing in F1 hybrids. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses indicate high level of genome differentiation between both morphotypes. This might be caused either by massive genome reshuffling during the evolution or, most likely, by origination of the two morphotypes from different parental species. As such, introgression-form of breeding involving several rounds of backcrosses resulting in the restoration of chromosome pairing regulator (at least in some plants) appears to be the only way to achieve stability of the hybrid genomes and thus, wider utilization of genetically stable and fertile hybrid tall fescue for forage and turf.	2019	10.1007/s10681-019-2419-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Kosmala, A; Zwierzykowski, Z; Gasior, D; Rapacz, M; Zwierzykowska, E; Humphreys, MW	GISH/FISH mapping of genes for freezing tolerance transferred from Festuca pratensis to Lolium multiflorum	HEREDITY	The first backcross breeding programme for the transfer of freezing-tolerance genes from winter hardy Festuca pratensis to winter-sensitive Lolium multiflorum is described. A partly fertile, triploid F-1 hybrid F. pratensis (2n=2x=14) x L. multiflorum (2n=4x=28) was employed initially, and after two backcrosses to L. multiflorum (2x) a total of 242 backcross two (BC2) plants were generated. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) was performed on 61 BC2 plants selected for their good growth and winter survival characters in the spring following one Polish winter (2000-2001). Among the winter survivors, diploid chromosome numbers were present in 80% of plants. An appropriate single Festuca introgression in an otherwise undisturbed Lolium genome could provide increased freezing tolerance without compromise to the good growth and plant vigour found in Lolium. Among all the diploids, a total of 20 individuals were identified, each with a single F. pratensis chromosome segment. Another diploid plant contained 13 Lolium chromosomes and a large metacentric F. pratensis chromosome, identified as chromosome 4, with two large distal Lolium introgressions on each chromosome arm. Three of the diploid BC2, including the genotype with Festuca chromosome 4 DNA sequences, were found to have freezing tolerance in excess of that of L. multiflorum, and in one case in excess of the F. pratensis used as control. A detailed cytological analysis combining GISH and fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses with rDNA probes revealed that the other two freezing-tolerant genotypes carried a Festuca chromosome segment at the same terminal location on the non-satellite arm of Lolium chromosome 2.	2006	10.1038/sj.hdy.6800787		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

(2n=12) was accompanied by complex hybridization and uniparental loss of ribosomal DNA	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	In the grass tribe Poeae a small group of taxa occur with an exceptionally low chromosome number of 2n = 2x = 4 belonging to the closely related genera Colpodium and Zingeria. To understand the formation of polyploids in this group we analyzed the evolution of allohexaploid Zingeria kochii (2n = 12) and its presumable ancestral species. Genomic in situ hybridization demonstrated that Z. kochii evolved from an interspecific hybrid involving species closely related to contemporary Z. biebersteiniana (2n = 4) and Colpodium versicolor (2n = 4) and a third unknown species. Following allopolyploidization of Z. kochii the biebersteiniana-like parental chromosomes underwent loss of ribosomal DNA. No interlocus homogenization of 45S rDNA took place in Z. kochii and phylogenetic analysis showed that C versicolor contributed its genome to Z. kochii relatively recently. In situ hybridization was particularly effective in understanding the allopolyploid evolution in Zingeria while the analysis of ITS sequences alone would have resulted in a wrong interpretation of the allopolyploid history of the genus.

Krishna, M. S. R.; Reddy, S. Sokka; Satyanarayana, Sadam D. V.	Marker-assisted breeding for introgression of opaque-2 allele into elite maize inbred line BML-7	3 BIOTECH	Improvement of quality protein maize (QPM) along with high content of lysine and tryptophan had foremost importance in maize breeding program. The efficient and easiest way of developing QPM hybrids was by backcross breeding in marker aided selection. Hence, the present investigation aimed at conversion of elite maize inbred line BML-7 into QPM line. CML-186 was identified to be a donor variety as it revealed high-quality polymorphism with BML-7 for opaque-2 gene specific marker umc1066. Non-QPM inbred line BML-7 was crossed with QPM donor CML-186 and produced F-1 followed by the development of BC1F1 and BC2F1 population. Foreground selection was carried out with umc1066 in F-1, and selected plants were used for BC1F1 and BC2F1 populations. Two hundred plants were screened in both BC1F1 and BC2F1 population with umc1066 for foreground selection amino acid modifiers. Foreground selected plants for both opaque-2 and amino acid modifiers were screened for background selection for BML-7 genome. Recurrent parent genome (RPG) was calculated for BC2F1 population plants. Two plants have shown with RPG 90-93% in two generation with back cross population. Two BC2F2 populations resulted from marker recognized BC2F1 individuals subjected toward foreground selection followed by tryptophan estimation. The tryptophan and lysine concentration was improved in all the plants. BC2F2 lines developed from hard endosperm kernels were selfed for BC2F2 lines and finest line was selected to illustrate the QPM version of BML-7, with 0.97% of tryptophan and 4.04% of lysine concentration in protein. Therefore, the QPM version of BML-7 line can be used for the development of single cross hybrid QPM maize version.	2017	10.1007/s13205-017-0842-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Krishna, M. S. R.; Reddy, Sokka S.	Marker assisted introgression of opaque-2 gene into elite maize inbred line BML-(7)	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY	Development of QPM (Quality Protein Maize) with high lysine and tryptophan is of foremost importance in maize breeding programme. Marker assisted selection in back cross breeding is the easiest way of developing QPM hybrids in less time. The present investigation was to attempt for conversion of elite maize inbred line BML-7 into QPM line. CML-181 was identified as a donor which showed good polymorphism with BML-7 for opaque-2 gene specific marker umc 1066. Non-QPM inbred line BML-7 was crossed with QPM donor CML-181 and produced F-1 followed by BC1F1 and BC2F1 population was developed. Foreground selection was carried out with umc 1066 in F-1 and selected plants were used for BC1F1 and BC2F1 populations. Two hundred plants were screened in both BC1F1 and BC2F1 population with umc 1066 for foreground selection. The selected plants were screened for foreground selection with amino acid modifiers. Foreground selected plants for both opaque-2 and amino acid modifiers were screened for background selection for BML-7 genome. Recurrent parent genome (RPG) was calculated for BC2F1 population plants. Two plants have shown with RPG 90 - 93 % in two generation back cross population. The BC2F2 population derived from marker identified BC2F1 individuals were subjected to foreground selection followed by tryptophan estimation. The tryptophan and lysine concentration improved in all the plants. BC2F2 lines developed from the hard endosperm kernels were selfed for BC2F2 lines and the best line was selected to represent the QPM version of BML-7, with tryptophan concentration of 0.96% and lysine 4.01% in protein. QPM version of BML-7 line can be used for the development of QPM version maize single cross hybrids.	2017			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

The destructive nature of the disease is mainly due to the genetic plasticity of M.oryzae which complicates the breeding strategies. Blast can be effectively managed by the deployment of R genes. In this study, broad-spectrum blast resistance genes Pi2 and Pi5 were introgressed independently into popular but blast susceptible rice variety, Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204) by applying marker-assisted backcross breeding approach. Tightly linked markers AP5930 for Pi2 and 40N23r for Pi5 gene were used in foreground selection. Background selection helped to identify the lines with maximum recovery of recurrent parent genome (RPG). The RPG recovery in Pi2 introgression lines was up to 90.17 and 91.46% in Pi5 lines. Homozygous introgression lines in BC3F4 generation carrying Pi2 and Pi5 gene were field evaluated for blast resistance, yield per se and yield-related traits. The lines showed resistance to leaf and neck blast in multilocation field evaluation. Improved BPT5204 lines with improvement for blast resistance were on par with original BPT5204 in terms of grain yield and grain features.	2017	10.1111/jph.12573		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ksiazczyk, Tomasz; Zwierzykowska, Elzbieta; Molik, Katarzyna; Taciak, Magdalena; Krajewski, Pawe; Zwierzykowski, Zbigniew	Genome-dependent chromosome dynamics in three successive generations of the allotetraploid Festuca pratensis x Lolium perenne hybrid	PROTOPLASMA	We focus on the identification of complete and recombined ribosomal DNA-bearing chromosomes, and the dynamics of chromosomal number and position of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci in the F-2-F-4 generations derived from the F-1 hybrid of Festuca pratensis Huds. (2n = 4x = 28) x Lolium perenne L. (2n = 4x = 28). Lolium genomic DNA and rRNA genes were mapped by means of genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (GISH and FISH). The results revealed that plants of the three generations share various rDNA loci profiles with chromosome structural changes, possibly as a result of chromosomal inter- and intra-rearrangements. We observed an asymmetrical variation in the number of recombinant arms with and without rDNA loci between parental genomes. The Lolium genome was more affected by rearrangements in arms with rDNA loci, while Festuca was more affected in arms without them. Statistically significant differences between L. perenne and F. pratensis genomes concerned the number of recombined chromosomes without rDNA, and the number of recombined rDNA-bearing chromosomal arms of marked chromosomes, showing a tendency of F. pratensis genome-like chromosomes to be less stable, compared with L. perenne. We postulate a novel genome-dependent range and type of chromosome variation in plants of the F-2-F-4 generations derived from F. pratensis x L. perenne hybrid.	2015	10.1007/s00709-014-0734-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Rohini, Laxmi, and Varuna (2n=4x=36, AABB), and an autotetraploid B. fruticulosa (2n=4x=32, FFFF) induced by colchicine using the latter as a pollen parent. Morphological and cytological analyses were carried out to confirm the hybrid nature of F-1 plants. The F-1 plants (2n=34) were intermediate for most of the morphological attributes. Although, the F(1)s showed poor pollen fertility, nevertheless, few seeds were obtained from open pollination. Meiotic analysis of F-1 plants showed a predominance of univalents, a typical feature of hybrids. The occurrence of bivalents, trivalent, and quadrivalent in PMCs of the F(1)s indicated homeologous pairing among the three genomes. The study suggests that B. fruticulosa has partial genome homeology with B. juncea which could be exploited in crop improvement programmes, particularly breeding for biotic stress especially, tolerance/resistance to the mustard aphid.	2018	10.1508/cytologia.83.421		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE

The F(1)s were obtained only when B. tournefortii was used as the female parent. Morphological, cytological and sequence tagged microsatellite sites (STMS) based molecular analyses were carried out to confirm the hybrid nature of F-1 plants. Morphologically, the F-1 plants were intermediate for most of the morphological attributes. Although, the F(1)s showed poor pollen fertility, a few seeds were obtained from open pollination in the surroundings of B. rapa. The F-1 plants showed predominance of univalents (53.66%), a typical feature of wide hybrids. The occurrence of chromosome association ranging from bivalents (0-4), trivalent (0-1) and quadrivalent (0-1) in the F(1)s indicated homeologous pairing between the T and A genomes. STMS analysis of the parents and the F(1)s revealed a high degree of similarity (75%) and rearrangements in the two genomes during or after their fusion. The study suggests that B. tournefortii has partial genome homeology with B. rapa which could be exploited in crop improvement programmes, particularly breeding for tolerance/resistance to white rust and mustard aphid.	2015	10.1508/cytologia.80.317		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Development of Gene-Pyramid Lines of the Elite Restorer Line, RPHR-1005 Possessing Durable Bacterial Blight and Blast Resistance	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	RPHR-1005, the stable restorer line of the popular medium slender (MS) grain type rice hybrid, DRRH-3 was improved in this study for resistance against bacterial blight (BB) and blast diseases through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). In this study, four major resistance genes (i.e., Xa21 and Xa33 for BB resistance and P12 and P154 for blast resistance) have been transferred to RPHR-1005 using RPBio Patho-1 (possessing Xa21 + P12), RPBio Patho-2 (possessing Xa21 + Pi54) and FBR1-15EM (possessing Xa33) as the donors. Foreground selection was carried out using PCR-based molecular markers specific for the target resistance genes and the major fertility restorer genes, Rf3 and Rf4, while background selection was carried out using a set of parental polymorphic rice SSR markers and backcrossing was continued uptoBC(2) generation. At BC2F2, plants possessing the gene combination- Xa21 + P12, Xa21 + P154 and Xa33 in homozygous condition and with >92% recovery of the recurrent parent genome (RPG) were identified and intercrossed to combine all the four resistance genes. Twenty-two homozygous, pyramid lines of RPHR-1005 comprising of three single-gene containing lines, six 2-gene containing lines, eight 3-gene containing lines, and five 4-gene containing lines were identified among the double intercross lines at F3 generation (DICF3). They were then evaluated for their resistance against BB and blast, fertility restoration ability and for key agro-morphological traits. While single gene containing lines were resistant to either BB or blast, the 2-gene, 3-gene, and 4-gene pyramid lines showed good level of resistance against both and/or either of the two diseases. Most of the 2-gene, 3-gene, and 4-gene containing pyramid lines showed yield levels and other key agro-morphological and grain quality traits comparable to the original recurrent parent and showed complete fertility restoration ability, with a few showing higher yield as compared to RPHR-1005. Further, the experimental hybrids derived by crossing the gene-pyramid lines of RPHR-1005 with APMS6A (the female parent of DRRH-3), showed heterosis levels equivalent to or higher than DRRH-3. The results of present study exemplify the utility of MABB for targeted improvement of multiple traits in hybrid rice.	2016	10.3389/fpls.2016.01195		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Bogo (AABBRR, 2n = 6x = 42). The molecular markers of resistance genes and in situ hybridization analysis of mitotic metaphase of root meristems confirmed the stable inheritance of chromosome 3D segments carrying Lr32 from the BC2F2 to the BC2F5 generation of (Ae. tauschii x S. cereale) x triticale hybrids. The chromosome pairing analysis during metaphase I of meiosis of BC2F4 and BC2F5 hybrids showed increasing regular bivalent formation of 3D chromosome pairs and decreasing number of univalents in subsequent generations. The results indicate that using amphiploid forms as a bridge between wild and cultivated forms can be a successful technology to transfer the D-genome chromatin carrying leaf rust resistance genes into triticale.	2015	10.1007/s13353-014-0264-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Commercial Lilium cultivars were produced primarily through 2n-gametes or 2x-gametes as parental plants or backcrossing. The primary genetic difference in 2 methods, is the presence of genomic recombination. Especially, GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) among molecular cytogenetic analysis, is the relevant technique to detect genetic information; genome composition, chromosome behavior during meiosis and recombination of hybrids as using their parental DNA as a probe. Based on previous studies, in this research, 12 LA (L. longiflorum x L. Asiatic hybrids) hybrids were analyzed by GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) along with ploidy analysis, and pollen germination tests. The LA hybrids used in this study, showed less pollen germination ability (ranged 0 - 21.74%), but germination of 'Caesars Palace' was significantly higher (59.09%). Interestingly, ploidy analysis showed that 'Caesars Palace' was tetraploid and 'Batistero' had one more additional chromosome from the L genome. Nine of the 12 cultivars exhibited recombination and 3 had only non-recombinant chromosomes; fewer L. longiflorum chromosomes were present in the cultivars than Asiatic chromosomes. Consequentially, it is assumed that 2n-gametes were more common methodology than 2x-gametes for producing commercial cultivars. Moreover, backcrossing tended to be performed with the Asiatic hybrid cultivar.	2017	10.1007/s13580-017-0019-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytological study	FALSE			FALSE	
Lai Yun-song; Huang Hai-qing; Xu Meng-yun; Wang Liang-chao; Zhang Xiao-bo; Zhang Ji-wen; Tu Ju-min	Development of Insect-Resistant Hybrid Rice by Introgressing the Bt Gene from Bt Rice Huahui 1 into II-32A/B, a Widely Used Cytogenic Male Sterile System	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE	Huahui 1 is an elite transgenic male sterile restorer line of wild rice abortive-type that expresses a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) delta-endotoxin and provides effective and economic control of lepidopteran insects. To exploit Huahui 1 to develop a new Bt rice, the insertion site of the Bt gene was determined by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR). Bt was located in the promoter region of LOC.Os10g10360, approximately 5.35 Mb from the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 10. For the first time, a Bt cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) system was developed by introgressing Bt from Huahui 1. The recipient CMS system used consisted of Indonesia paddy rice-type II-32B (maintainer line) and II-32A (male sterile line). Marker-assisted selection was used to increase selection efficiency in the backcrossing program. In BC5F1, the Bt plant 85015-8 was selected for further analyses, as it had the highest SSR marker homozygosity. In addition, the linkage drag of the foreign Bt gene in 85015-8 was minimized to 8.01-11.46 Mb. The foreign Bt gene was then delivered from 85015-8 into II-32A. The resultant Bt II-32A and Bt II-32B lines were both resistant to lepidopteran in field trials, and agronomic traits were not disturbed. The maintainability of II-32B, and the male sterility and general combining ability of II-32A, were not affected by the Bt introgression. This study demonstrates a simple and fast approach to develop Bt hybrid rice.	2014	10.1016/S2095-3119(13)60538-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Micronucleation in Developing Spathiphyllum wallisii Regel Microspores for Microprotoplast Preparation	XXIV INTERNATIONAL EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM SECTION ORNAMENTALS: ORNAMENTAL BREEDING WORLDWIDE	Fusion of protoplasts and microprotoplasts is a known method for producing asymmetric somatic hybrids. One prerequisite for microprotoplast induction is use of an efficient tool to form micronuclei in somatic or gametic cells. We chose to use pollen mother cells as starting material. Preliminary results indicated that micronucleation is restricted to a particular flower stage. Dissected full anthers of genotype 6526 of Spathiphyllum wallisii were treated in a culture room with different concentrations of oryzalin, a spindle toxin, at concentrations of 10, 20, 50 and 100 mu M in half-strength liquid MS media. Observations of pollen in various developmental stages were made at 24, 48, 72 and 96-hour intervals after treatment. The observations were made using a fluorescent microscope after staining the anthers with 4' 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The micro-nucleation index (percentage of cells with additional micronuclei) was measured. The number of nuclei per cell varied between 1 and 9. This fragmentation was observed in pollen mother cells, dyads, and tetrads as well as in mature pollens. At a concentration of 100 mu M oryzalin, formation of mature pollen was significantly inhibited. The highest micro-nucleation index (0.93) was observed after 72 h culture of anthers treated with 10 mu M oryzalin. The lowest micro-nucleation index (0.13) was observed 24 h after treatment with 100 mu M oryzalin. These results can lead to development of protocols for obtaining protoplasts containing 1 to a few chromosomes for microprotoplast mediated chromosome transfer (Doherty and Fisher, 2003). This research may form the basis for introgression of chromosomes between Araceae species.	2012			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE

(CCDD), O. alta Swallen (CCDD) and O. punctata Kotschy (BBCC) with a labelled probe of C(0)t-1 DNA from O. officinalis. In O. officinalis, the homologous chromosomes showed similar signal bands probed by C(0)t-1 DNA and karyotype analysis was conducted based on the band patterns. Using no blocking DNA, the probe identified the chromosomes of C genome clearly, but detected few signals on chromosomes of A genome in the F, hybrid and two backcross progenies of BC1. It is obvious that the highly and moderately repetitive DNA sequences were considerably different between C and A genomes. The chromosomes of C genome were also discriminated from the chromosomes of D-and B-genome in the tetraploid species O. latifolia, O. alta and O. punctata by C(0)t-1 DNA-FISH. Comparison of the fluorescence intensity on the chromosomes of B, C and D genomes in O. latifolia, O. alta, and O. punctata indicated that the differentiations between C and D genomes are less than that between C and B genomes. The relationship between C and D genomes in O. alta is closer than that of C and D genomes in O. latifolia. This would be one of the causes for the fact that both the genomes are of the same karyotype (CCDD) but belong to different species. The above results showed that the C(0)t-1 DNA had a high specificity of genome and species. In this paper, the origin of allotetraploid in genus Oryza is also discussed.	2006	10.1007/s11434-006-2049-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Larson, Steven R.; Kishii, Masahiro; Tsujimoto, Hisashi; Qi, Lili; Chen, Peidu; Lazo, Gerard R.; Jensen, Kevin B.; Wang, Richard R-C	Leymus EST linkage maps identify 4NsL-5NsL reciprocal translocation, wheat-Leymus chromosome introgressions, and functionally important gene loci	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) Leymus triticoides and Leymus cinereus are divergent perennial grasses, which form fertile hybrids. Genetic maps with n = 14 linkage groups (LG) comprised with 1,583 AFLP and 67 heterologous anchor markers were previously used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in these hybrids, and chromosomes of other Leymus wildryes have been transferred to wheat. However, identifications of the x = 7 homoeologous groups were tenuous and genetic research has been encumbered by a lack of functional, conserved gene marker sequences. Herein, we mapped 350 simple sequence repeats and 26 putative lignin biosynthesis genes from a new Leymus EST library and constructed one integrated consensus map with 799 markers, including 375 AFLPs and 48 heterologous markers, spanning 2,381 centiMorgans. LG1b and LG6b were reassigned as LG6b* and LG1b*, respectively, and LG4Ns and LG4Xm were inverted so that all 14 linkage groups are aligned to the x = 7 Triticeae chromosomes based on EST alignments to barley and other reference genomes. Amplification of 146 mapped Leymus ESTs representing six of the seven homoeologous groups was shown for 17 wheat-Leymus chromosome introgression lines. Reciprocal translocations between 4L and 5L in both Leymus and Triticum monococcum were aligned to the same regions of Brachypodium chromosome 1. A caffeic acid O-methyltransferase locus aligned to fiber QTL peaks on Leymus LG7a and brown midrib mutations of maize and sorghum. Glaucousness genes on Leymus and wheat chromosome 2 were aligned to the same region of Brachypodium chromosome 5. Markers linked to the S self-incompatibility gene on Leymus LG1a cosegregated with markers on LG2b, possibly cross-linked by gametophytic selection. Homoeologous chromosomes 1 and 2 harbor the S and Z gametophytic self-incompatibility genes of Phalaris, Secale, and Lolium, but the Leymus chromosome-2 self-incompatibility gene aligns to a different region on Brachypodium chromosome 5. Nevertheless, cosegregation of self-incompatibility genes on Leymus presents a powerful system for mapping these loci.	2012	10.1007/s00122-011-1698-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Lashermes, Philippe; Combes, Marie-Christine; Ansaldi, Caroline; Gichuru, Elijah; Noir, Sandra	Analysis of alien introgression in coffee tree (Coffea arabica L.)	MOLECULAR BREEDING	The transfer of desired traits from related wild diploid Coffea species into the cultivated allotetraploid C. arabica is essential in coffee breeding to develop pest/disease-resistant cultivars. The present work is an attempt to gain insights into alien introgression in C. arabica. An F2 population derived from a cross between T5296 and Et6 was analysed with simple sequence repeat (SSR; microsatellite) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) molecular markers. The T5296 is a derivative of an interspecific hybrid introgressed by the diploid C. canephora species and Et6 is a wild Ethiopian accession of C. arabica. The origin of the revealed polymorphism was determined by comparisons using representative accessions from C. arabica and its two diploid parental species, C. eugenioides and C. canephora. The number and mode of inheritance of canephora-introgressed segments were investigated, as well as their sub-genome localisation and rate of recombination. The results suggested that the transfer of desirable genes into C. arabica from C. canephora is not limited by the ploidy level differences or the suppression of recombination between the different genomes.	2011	10.1007/s11032-010-9424-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Lee, Yung -I; Tseng, Yu -Fang; Lee, Yi-Ching; Chung, Mei-Chu	Chromosome constitution and nuclear DNA content of Phalaenopsis hybrids	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	Phalaenopsis is one of the most popular potted plants in the horticultural market because of the colorful and long-lasting flowers. In Phalaenopsis, interspecific hybridization between sections or subgenera has long been used for breeding cultivars with novel traits. Considering the diverse genome size and karyomorphology in Phalaenopsis species used in breeding, a study of genome size and chromosome composition would be crucial to provide fundamental knowledge for Phalaenopsis breeding. In this study, we characterized the chromosome composition of 60 representative Phalaenopsis cultivars of various colors and types commonly used in breeding programs. Our genome size analyses indicated that calculating the ploidy of Phalaenopsis cultivars based on their C-value data is difficult because of the diverse genome sizes of the parental species and different genome introgression of the parental species used for hybrids. Most Phalaenopsis cultivars are polyploid, and a few cultivars possess hyperand hypoploid chromosome numbers. Analysis of chromosome composition of these cultivars suggested that the occurrence of unreduced gametes played a significant role in polyploidization of Phalaenopsis cultivars during breeding. Chromosomal data also demonstrated different chromosome introgression of parental species in novelty and harlequin types of cultivars. The genome size and chromosomal data provided in this study are important for breeders to assist in planning efficient Phalaenopsis breeding programs.	2020	10.1016/j.scienta.2019.109089		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	synthetic hybrids	FALSE			FALSE

Microsatellite Mapping of a Leaf Rust Resistance Gene Transferred to Common Wheat from Triticum timopheevii	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS	A leaf rust resistance gene transferred from the tetraploid wheat Triticum timopheevii (Zhuk.) Zhuk. (genomic composition: A(t)A(t)GG) into common wheat Triticum aestivum L. conditioned resistance at the seedling and adult plant stages in the introgression line 'line 842-2'. To determine chromosome location and to map the resistance gene an F-2 population from a cross between 'line 842-2' and susceptible wheat cultivar 'Skala' was developed and screened against leaf rust pathotype 77 (Puccinia triticina Erikss.). Microsatellite markers detected introgressions of the T. timopheevii genome on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 5B and 6B of 'line 842-2'. Linkage analysis revealed an association between leaf rust resistance and microsatellite markers located on chromosome 5B. The markers Xgwm880 and Xgwm1257 were closely linked to the resistance gene with genetic distances of 7.7 cM and 10.4 cM, respectively. Infection type tests with three leaf rust isolates resulted in different patterns of infection types of 'line 842-2' and 'Thatcher' near-isogenic line with the Lr18 gene on chromosome 5B. The data corroborated the hypothesis of the diversity of the resistance coming from T. timopheevii. The resistance gene of the introgression 'line 842-2' seems to be different than Lr18 and therefore it was designated LrTt2.	2010	10.1556/CRC.38.2010.2.7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Leonova, I. N.; Roeder, M. S.; Kalinina, N. P.; Budashkina, E. B.	Genetic analysis and localization of loci controlling leaf rust resistance of Triticum aestivum x Triticum timopheevii introgression lines	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Introgressive lines resulting from crossing common wheat Triticum aestivum with the tetraploid T. timopheevii are characterized by effective resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. Molecular analysis using 350 specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers determined localization of the T. timopheevii genome in chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 5A, 5B, and 6B. A population of F-2 offspring of crossing hybrid line 842-2 with common wheat cultivar Skala was obtained for mapping the loci controlling leaf rust resistance. Analysis of association of phenotypic and genotypic data by means of simple interval mapping (SIM) and composite interval mapping (CIM) has shown that the resistance of adult plants is determined by two loci in chromosomes 5B and 2A. The major locus QLr.icg-5B, transferred from T. timopheevii chromosome 5G mapped to the interval of microsatellite loci Xgwm408-Xgwm1257 controls 72% of the phenotypic variance of the trait. The other, minor locus QLr.icg-2A located to chromosome 2A at a distance of 10 cM from Xgwm312 accounts for 7% of the trait expression. Microsatellite markers located near these loci may be used for controlling the transfer of agronomically valuable loci when new lines and cultivars are created.	2008	10.1134/S1022795408120077		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Leppala, Johanna; Bokma, Folmer; Savolainen, Outi	Investigating Incipient Speciation in Arabidopsis lyrata from Patterns of Transmission Ratio Distortion	GENETICS	Our understanding of the development of intrinsic reproductive isolation is still largely based on theoretical models and thorough empirical studies on a small number of species. Theory suggests that reproductive isolation develops through accumulation of epistatic genic incompatibilities, also known as Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities. We can detect these from marker transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in hybrid progenies of crosses between species or populations, where TRD is expected to result from selection against heterospecific allele combinations in hybrids. TRD may also manifest itself because of intragenomic conflicts or competition between gametes or zygotes. We studied early stage speciation in Arabidopsis lyrata by investigating patterns of TRD across the genome in F-2 progenies of three reciprocal crosses between four natural populations. We found that the degree of TRD increases with genetic distance between crossed populations, but also that reciprocal progenies may differ substantially in their degree of TRD. Chromosomes AL6 and especially AL1 appear to be involved in many single- and two-locus distortions, but the location and source of TRD vary between crosses and between reciprocal progenies. We also found that the majority of single- and two-locus TRD appears to have a gametic, as opposed to zygotic, origin. Thus, while theory on BDM incompatibilities is typically illustrated with derived nuclear alleles proving incompatible in hybrid zygotes, our results suggest a prominent role for distortions emerging before zygote formation.	2013	10.1534/genetics.113.152561		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Here, we established a RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) system as an invivo desired-target mutator (DTM) in maize to reduce the linkage drag during breeding procedure, using the LIGULELESS1 (LG1) locus as a proof-of-concept. Our system showed 51.5%-91.2% mutation frequency in T0 transgenic plants. We then crossed the T1 plants stably expressing DTM with six diverse recipient maize lines and found that 11.79%-28.71% of the plants tested were mutants induced by the DTM effect. Analysis of successive F2 plants indicated that the mutations induced by the DTM effect were largely heritable. Moreover, DTM-generated hybrids had significantly smaller leaf angles that were reduced more than 50% when compared with that of the wild type. Planting experiments showed that DTM-generated maize plants can be grown with significantly higher density and hence greater yield potential. Our work demonstrate that stably expressed RGEN could be implemented as an invivoDTM to rapidly generate and spread desired mutations in maize through hybridization and subsequent backcrossing, and hence bypassing the linkage drag effect in convention introgression methodology. This proof-of-concept experiment can be a potentially much more efficient breeding strategy in crops employing the RNA-guided Cas9 genome editing.	2017	10.1111/pbi.12739		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Dawei; Qi, Xiaoqiong; Li, Xinwei; Li, Li; Zhong, Caihong; Huang, Hongwen	Maternal inheritance of mitochondrial genomes and complex inheritance of chloroplast genomes in Actinidia Lind.: evidences from interspecific crosses	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS	The inheritance pattern of chloroplast and mitochondria is a critical determinant in studying plant phylogenetics, biogeography and hybridization. To better understand chloroplast and mitochondrial inheritance patterns in Actinidia (traditionally called kiwifruit), we performed 11 artificial interspecific crosses and studied the ploidy levels, morphology, and sequence polymorphisms of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of parents and progenies. Sequence analysis showed that the mtDNA haplotypes of F1 hybrids entirely matched those of the female parents, indicating strictly maternal inheritance of Actinidia mtDNA. However, the cpDNA haplotypes of F1 hybrids, which were predominantly derived from the male parent (9 crosses), could also originate from the mother (1 cross) or both parents (1 cross), demonstrating paternal, maternal, and biparental inheritance of Actinidia cpDNA. The inheritance patterns of the cpDNA in Actinidia hybrids differed according to the species and genotypes chosen to be the parents, rather than the ploidy levels of the parent selected. The multiple inheritance modes of Actinidia cpDNA contradicted the strictly paternal inheritance patterns observed in previous studies, and provided new insights into the use of cpDNA markers in studies of phylogenetics, biogeography and introgression in Actinidia and other angiosperms.	2013	10.1007/s00438-012-0732-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	mani;ulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Gang; Hu, Wei; Qin, Rui; Jin, Huajun; Tan, Guangxuan; Zhu, Lili; He, Guangcun	Simple sequence repeat analyses of interspecific hybrids and MAALs of Oryza officinalis and Oryza sativa	GENETICA	Wild rice is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L., AA genome). Molecular markers are important tools for monitoring gene introgression from wild rice into cultivated rice. In this study, Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to analyze interspecific hybrids of O. sativa-O. officinalis (CC genome), the backcrossing progenies and the parent plants. Results showed that most of the SSR primers (335 out of 396, 84.6%) developed in cultivated rice successfully amplified products from DNA samples of wild rice O. officinalis. The polymorphism ratio of SSR bands between O. sativa and O. officinalis was as high as 93.9%, indicating differences between the two species with respect to SSRs. When the SSR markers were applied in the interspecific hybrids, only a portion of SSR primers amplified O. officinalis-specific bands in the F-1 hybrid (52.5%), BC1 (52.5%), and MAALs (37.0%); a number of the bands disappeared. Of the 124 SSR loci that detected officinalis-specific bands in MAAL plants, 96 (77.4%) showed synteny between the A and C-genomes, and 20 (16.1%) showed duplication in the C-genome. Sequencing analysis revealed that indels, substitution and duplication contribute to the diversity of SSR loci between the genomes of O. sativa and O. officinalis.	2008	10.1007/s10709-007-9222-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Gang; Tang, Ming; Hu, Wei; He, Guangcun; Liu, Hong; Liu, Xuequn; Qin, Rui	Characterization of an Alien Chromosome of Oryza officinalis Transferred the Genomic and Cytological Environment of Oryza sativa	JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY	Distant hybridization between rice species and their genome interactions have become the hot points of genetic research. The new formed hybrid was unstable and many of the alien chromosomes would be excluded out in the meiosis procedure. In this study, we investigated the phenomenon that the monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) of Oryza officinalis (CC)-Oryza sativa (AA) inherited in the genomic and cytoplasmic environments of cultivated rice. In a series of backcross programs, every time the MAALs were backcrossed with the recurrent parent Hejiang19, we get a portion of the backcross progenies that were similar to the female parent MAALs in morphological characters (with rolled leaves) and chromosome constitutions (2n + 1). The monosomic alien chromosome exhibited stable inheritance in the genomic and cytoplasmic environments of cultivated rice. Molecular biology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses on mitotic cells showed that the alien chromosomes in MAALs were inclined to be transferred integrated into the backcross progenies with rolled leaves and no big fragments of alien chromosomes introgressing into the chromosomes of cultivated rice. By FISH analysis on the meiotic cells, we proved that the single alien chromosome performing nonstandard meiosis and behaving like a dispensable genetic factor, which would be the cytological reasons for the stable inheritance of alien chromosomes.	2010	10.1007/s12374-010-9118-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Hao; Deal, Karin R.; Luo, Ming-Cheng; Ji, Wanquan; Distelfeld, Assaf; Dvorak, Jan	Introgression of the Aegilops speltoides Su1-Ph1 Suppressor into Wheat	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Meiotic pairing between homoeologous chromosomes in polyploid wheat is inhibited by the Ph1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 5 in the B genome. Aegilops speltoides (genomes SS), the closest relative of the progenitor of the wheat B genome, is polymorphic for genetic suppression of Ph1. Using this polymorphism, two major suppressor loci, Su1-Ph1 and Su2-Ph1, have been mapped in Ae. speltoides. Su1-Ph1 is located in the distal, high-recombination region of the long arm of the Ae. speltoides chromosome 3S. Its location and tight linkage to marker Xpsr1205-3S makes Su1-Ph1 a suitable target for introgression into wheat. Here, Xpsr1205-3S was introgressed into hexaploid bread wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and from there into tetraploid durum wheat cv. Langdon (LDN). Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization showed that an Ae. speltoides segment with Xpsr1205-3S replaced the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 3A. In the CS genetic background, the chromosome induced homoeologous chromosome pairing in interspecific hybrids with Ae. peregrina but not in progenies from crosses involving alien disomic substitution lines. In the LDN genetic background, the chromosome induced homoeologous chromosome pairing in both interspecific hybrids and progenies from crosses involving alien disomic substitution lines. We conclude that the recombined chromosome harbors Su1-Ph1 but its expression requires expression of complementary gene that is present in LDN but absent in CS. We suggest that it is unlikely that Su1-Ph1 and ZIP4-1, a paralog of Ph1 located on wheat chromosomes 3A and 3B and Ae. tauschii chromosome 3D, are equivalent. The utility of Su1-Ph1 for induction of recombination between homoeologous chromosomes in wheat is illustrated.	2017	10.3389/fpls.2017.02163		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Jian; Chitwood, Jessica; Menda, Naama; Mueller, Lukas; Hutton, Samuel F.	Linkage between the I-3 gene for resistance to Fusarium wilt race 3 and increased sensitivity to bacterial spot in tomato	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	The negative association between the I - 3 gene and increased sensitivity to bacterial spot is due to linkage drag (not pleiotropy) and may be remedied by reducing the introgression size. Fusarium wilt is one of the most serious diseases of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) throughout the world. There are three races of the pathogen (races 1, 2 and 3), and the deployment of three single, dominant resistance genes corresponding to each of these has been the primary means of controlling the disease. The I-3 gene was introgressed from S. pennellii and confers resistance to race 3. Although I-3 provides effective control, it is negatively associated with several horticultural traits, including increased sensitivity to bacterial spot disease (Xanthomonas spp.). To test the hypothesis that this association is due to linkage with unfavorable alleles rather than to pleiotropy, we used a map-based approach to develop a collection of recombinant inbred lines varying for portions of I-3 introgression. Progeny of recombinants were evaluated for bacterial spot severity in the field for three seasons, and disease severities were compared between I-3 introgression haplotypes for each recombinant. Results indicated that increased sensitivity to bacterial spot is not associated with the I-3 gene, but rather with an upstream region of the introgression. A survey of public and private inbred lines and hybrids indicates that the majority of modern I-3 germplasm contains a similarly sized introgression for which the negative association with bacterial spot likely persists. In light of this, it is expected that the development and utilization of a reduced I-3 introgression will significantly improve breeding efforts for resistance to Fusarium wilt race 3.	2018	10.1007/s00122-017-2991-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Jianbo; Lang, Tao; Li, Bin; Yu, Zhihui; Wang, Hongjin; Li, Guangrong; Yang, Ennian; Yang, Zujun	Introduction of Thinopyrum intermedium ssp trichophorum chromosomes to wheat by trigeneric hybridization involving Triticum, Secale and Thinopyrum genera	PLANTA	Main conclusion Fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular markers have confirmed that several chromosomes from Thinopyrum intermedium ssp. trichophorum have been added to a wheat background, which originated from a cross between a wheat- Thinopyrum partial amphiploid and triticale. The lines displayed blue grains and resistance to wheat stripe rust. Thinopyrum intermedium has been used as a valuable resource for improving the disease resistance and yield potential of wheat. With the aim to transfer novel genetic variation from Th. intermedium species for sustainable wheat breeding, a new trigeneric hybrid was produced by crossing an octoploid wheat-Th. intermedium ssp. trichophorum partial amphiploid with hexaploid triticale. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that Thinopyrum chromosomes were transmitted preferably and the number of rye chromosomes tended to decrease gradually in the selfed derivatives of the trigeneric hybrids. Four stable wheat-Th. intermedium chromosome substitution, addition and translocation lines were selected, and a 2J(S) addition line, two substitution lines of 4J(S)(4B) and 4J(4B), and a small 4J.4B translocation line were identified by FISH and molecular markers. It was revealed that the gene(s) responsible for blue grains may located on the FL0.60-1.00 of long arm of Th. intermedium-derived 4J chromosome. Disease resistance screenings indicated that chromosomes 4J(S) and 2J(S) appear to enhance the resistance to stripe rust in the adult plant stage. The new germplasm with Th. intermedium introgression shows promise for utilization of Thinopyrum chromosome segments in future wheat improvement.	2017	10.1007/s00425-017-2669-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Liang; Xu, Xiaowei; Jin, Weiwei; Chen, Shaojiang	Morphological and molecular evidences for DNA introgression in haploid induction via a high oil inducer CAUHOI in maize	PLANTA	The phenomenon of maternal haploid induction in maize was first described many years ago, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, the Stock-6-derived, haploid-inducing line CAUHOI with high kernel oil content (KOC), was used as the pollinator to produce maternal haploids from the maize hybrid ZD958 with low KOC. CAUHOI is homozygous for the dominant marker gene R1-nj. Haploids were identified by morphological and cytological investigations. The frequency of haploid induction from this cross was 2.21%. Unexpectedly, many haploid kernels had weakly pigmented purple color on the embryo, and some haploid kernels had high KOC. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis showed that 43.18% of the haploids carried segments from CAUHOI, and a small proportion (average 1.84%) of the genome of CAUHOI was introgressed into haploids. Haploid kernels with high KOC had a higher frequency of segment introgression from CAUHOI (2.92%) than that in haploid kernels with low KOC (1.79%), showing that the marker gene R1-nj and high-oil genes from CAUHOI were expressed during the development of some haploid embryos, and confirmed that the DNA introgression from the inducer parent occurred during maternal haploid induction. Together, these results suggested that the chromosome elimination was probably responsible for haploid induction in maize, and late somatic elimination might occur. Several possible mechanisms underlying haploid formation are discussed.	2009	10.1007/s00425-009-0943-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Herein, the selfed progenies of this MAAL were extensively selected and analyzed to screen the rapeseed-type plants (2n = 38) with good male fertility and to produce their doubled haploid (DH) lines by microspore culture. From the investigation of fertility restoration in the F-1 hybrids with inap CMS, one DH line (RF 39) was identified to adequately restore male fertility and likely carried one dominant RF gene. Specifically, this restorer produced brown pollen grains, similar to the woad and the MAAL, suggesting that this trait is closely linked with the RF gene(s) and serves as one phenotypic marker for the restorer. This restorer contained 38 chromosomes of rapeseed and no intact chromosomes of woad, but some DNA fragments of woad origin were detected at low frequency. This restorer was much improved for pollen and seed fertility and for low glucosinolate content. The successful breeding of the restorer for inap CMS rendered this new pollination control system feasible for rapeseed hybrid production.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.00257		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Shuxian; Chen, Ying; Gao, Handong; Yin, Tongming	Potential chromosomal introgression barriers revealed by linkage analysis in a hybrid of Pinus massoniana and P. hwangshanensis	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying speciation is a hot topic in modern genetics and evolutionary studies. Distortion of marker transmission ratio is frequently ascribed to selection against alleles that cause hybrid incompatibility. The natural introgression between P. massoniana and P. hwangshanensis and their distribution ranges lead to the emergence of the two species as desirable organisms to study the genetic mechanisms for speciation. Results: Using seeds sampled from trees at different elevations, we consistently detected sharp decreases in seed germination rates of trees in the hybrid zone, which might be due largely to the hybrid incompatibility. A genetic map was established using 192 megagametophytes from a single tree in the hybrid zone of the two species. Segregation distortion analysis revealed that the percentage of significant-segregation-distortion (SSD) markers was extremely high, accounting for more than 25% of the segregating markers. The extension range, the distortion direction, and the distortion intensity of SSD markers also varied dramatically on different linkage groups. Conclusions: In this study, we display the potential chromosomal introgression barriers between P. massoniana and P. hwangshanensis. Our study provides a valuable platform for conducting genome-wide association of hybrid incompatible QTLs and/or candidate genes with marker transmission ratio distortion in the hybrid.	2010	10.1186/1471-2229-10-37		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	estimated segregation distortion from a single hybrid individual	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Shuxian; Tang, Zaixiang; Zhang, Defang; Ye, Ning; Xu, Chenwu; Yin, Tongming	Genome-wide detection of genetic loci triggering uneven descending of gametes from a natural hybrid pine	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	Marker transmission ratio distortion (TRD) revealed in genetic mapping studies on distant crosses can be used to infer the genetic basis relating to reproductive barriers between species. Unlike measuring the degree of TRD by the overall number of segregation distorted markers in the affected genome regions, mapping the segregation distorting loci (SDL) provides reliable statistic parameters that help to confine the target genomic regions for further characterization at molecular level. Using the linkage map constructed for a natural hybrid of Pinus hwangshanensis and Pinus massoniana, we perform SDL analyses and align the established map to the loblolly pine consensus map. Altogether, six SDLs with relatively strong LOD supports are detected on four linkage groups of the established map. Since gametes inheriting different alternate chromatid blocks from the SDL affecting genome regions have uneven chance to descend to the offspring, the corresponding genome regions are supposed to play more significant roles in rendering the reproductive isolations between P. hwangshanensis and P. massoniana. This paper presents a case study on a crucial step for uncovering the hidden genetic factors that trigger the uneven descending of gametes in a natural hybrid pine.	2012	10.1007/s11295-012-0524-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	segregation distortion mapping/ manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Li, Ying; Yang, Yongzhi; Yu, Le; Du, Xin; Ren, Guangpeng	Plastomes of nine hornbeams and phylogenetic implications	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Poor phylogenetic resolution and inconsistency of gene trees are major complications when attempting to construct trees of life for various groups of organisms. In this study, we addressed these issues in analyses of the genus Carpinus (hornbeams) of the Betulaceae. We assembled and annotated the chloroplast (cp) genomes (plastomes) of nine hornbeams representing main clades previously distinguished in this genus. All nine plastomes are highly conserved, with four regions, and about 158-160kb long, including 121-123 genes. Phylogenetic analyses of whole plastome sequences, noncoding sequences, and the well-aligned coding genes resulted in high resolution of the sampled species in contrast to the failure based on a few cpDNA markers. Phylogenetic relationships in a few clades based only on the coding genes are slightly inconsistent with those based on the noncoding and total plastome datasets. Moreover, these plastome trees are highly incongruent with those based on bi-parentally inherited internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence variations. Such high inconsistencies suggest widespread occurrence of incomplete lineage sorting and hybrid introgression during diversification of these hornbeams.	2018	10.1002/ece3.4414		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression not explicitly measured	FALSE			FALSE	
Liu, Chun; Li, Shuo; Wang, Mengcheng; Xia, Guangmin	A transcriptomic analysis reveals the nature of salinity tolerance of a wheat introgression line	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY	The bread wheat cultivar Shanrong No.3 (SR3) is a salinity tolerant derivative of an asymmetric somatic hybrid between cultivar Jinan 177 (JN177) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum). To reveal some of the mechanisms underlying its elevated abiotic stress tolerance, both SR3 and JN177 were exposed to iso-osmotic NaCl and PEG stress, and the resulting gene expression was analysed using a customized microarray. Some genes associated with stress response proved to be more highly expressed in SR3 than in JN177 in non-stressed conditions. Its unsaturated fatty acid and flavonoid synthesis ability was also enhanced, and its pentose phosphate metabolism was more active than in JN177. These alterations in part accounted for the observed shift in the homeostasis related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The specific down-regulation of certain ion transporters after a 0.5 h exposure to 340 mM NaCl demonstrated that Na(+) uptake occurred rapidly, so that the early phase of salinity stress imposes more than simply an osmotic stress. We discussed the possible effect of the introgression of new genetic materials in wheat genome on stress tolerance.	2012	10.1007/s11103-011-9854-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Liu, Min; Li, Zai-Yun	Genome doubling and chromosome elimination with fragment recombination leading to the formation of Brassica rapa-type plants with genomic alterations in crosses with Orychophragmus violaceus	GENOME	In distant hybridization of plants, nonclassical hybrids with unexpected chromosome complements, chromosome elimination, and genetic introgression have been well documented. We obtained intergeneric hybrids between Brassica rapa, B. rapa var. chinensis, and another cruciferous species, Orychophragmus violaceus, following embryo rescue. Hybrids mainly displayed phenotypes of B. rapa, although certain O. violaceus or novel characteristics also appeared. Variable numbers of chromosomes were observed in somatic cells in the roots of plantlets on medium and in ovaries and pollen mother cells (PMCs). However, higher numbers were recorded in the roots. GISH revealed that the majority of ovary cells and PMCs contained 20 chromosomes of B. rapa with or without individual O. violaceus chromosomes or fragments added or introgressed. AFLP analysis showed that fragments deleted from the B. rapa genome were much more frequent than novel and O. violaceus fragments. The mechanisms involved genome doubling and successive elimination of O. violaceus chromosomes accompanied by fragment recombination and introgression, producing B. rapa-type plants with modified genetic constitutions and phenotypes.	2007	10.1139/G07-071		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Liu, Ting; Yu, Yan; Cai, Xingkui; Tu, Wei; Xie, Conghua; Liu, Jun	Introgression of bacterial wilt resistance from Solanum melongena to S . t uberosum through asymmetric protoplast fusion	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE	Bacterial wilt (BW) caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is an important disease of many plant species especially Solanaceae. To compensate for lack of BW resistance in cultivated potato, we fused UV-treated protoplasts of a resistant eggplant variety with protoplasts of a susceptible potato clone to obtain 32 somatic hybrids. Although asymmetric protoplast fusion has the potential to transfer traits from distant species, introgression frequency and preference of alien fragments remain obscure, as well as the genetic basis for control of a trait. In the present research, the genome components of 32 somatic hybrids were determined by parent-specific SSRs. Each hybrid had integrated from one to eight alien chromosome fragments, providing a foundation for selection of BW resistance transmitted from eggplant. When the selected eggplant sequences were aligned with potato genome sequence it showed a similarity of 46.7 %, suggesting a large genetic distance between these two species. The results also revealed that introgression of eggplant fragments is non-selective, which may allow any part of alien chromosomes to be integrated. Distribution of eggplant loci in individual hybrids suggested a possible relationship between markers emk03O04, emi04P17 and emd13E02a and BW resistance, which are potential loci that control target traits and therefore deserve further investigation. With genome-wide selection of parent-specific molecular markers and sequence alignment, the present research substantiated interspecific introgression of a trait lacking in potato. Moreover, an efficient strategy was established to estimate genomic components of the somatic hybrids, and to explore the candidate loci that associate with target traits.	2016	10.1007/s11240-016-0958-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Diversity analysis and genomic prediction of Sclerotinia resistance in sunflower using a new 25 K SNP genotyping array	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Key message We have developed a SNP array for sunflower containing more than 25 K markers, representing single loci mostly in or near transcribed regions of the genome. The array was successfully applied to genotype a diversity panel of lines, hybrids, and mapping populations and represented well the genetic diversity of cultivated sunflower. Results of PCoA and population substructure analysis underlined the complexity of the genetic composition of current elite breeding material. The performance of this genotyping platform for genome-based prediction of phenotypes and detection of QTL with improved resolution could be demonstrated based on the re-evaluation of a population segregating for resistance to Sclerotinia midstalk rot. Given our results, the newly developed 25 K SNP array is expected to be of great utility for the most important applications in genome-based sunflower breeding and research. Genotyping with a large number of molecular markers is a prerequisite to conduct genome-based genetic analyses with high precision. Here, we report the design and performance of a 25 K SNP genotyping array for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). SNPs were discovered based on variant calling in de novo assembled, UniGene-based contigs of sunflower derived from whole genome sequencing and amplicon sequences originating from four and 48 inbred lines, respectively. After inclusion of publically available transcriptome-derived SNPs, in silico design of the Illumina(A (R)) Infinium iSelect HD BeadChip yielded successful assays for 22,299 predominantly haplotype-specific SNPs. The array was validated in a sunflower diversity panel including inbred lines, open-pollinated varieties, introgression lines, landraces, recombinant inbred lines, and F-2 populations. Validation provided 20,502 high-quality bi-allelic SNPs with stable cluster performance whereby each SNP marker represents a single locus mostly in or near transcribed regions of the sunflower genome. Analyses of population structure and quantitative resistance to Sclerotinia midstalk rot demonstrate that this array represents a significant improvement over currently available genomic tools for genetic diversity analyses, genome-wide marker-trait association studies, and genetic mapping in sunflower.	2016	10.1007/s00122-015-2629-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Lohe, Allan R.; Perotti, Enrico	Intertribal hybrid plants produced from crossing Arabidopsis thaliana with apomictic Boechera	PLANTA	Arabidopsis thaliana and Boechera belong to different tribes of the Brassicaceae and last shared a common ancestor 13-35 million years ago. A. thaliana reproduces sexually but some Boechera accessions reproduce by apomixis (asexual reproduction by seed). The two species are reproductively isolated, preventing introgression of the trait(s) controlling apomixis from Boechera into A. thaliana and their molecular characterisation. To identify if "escapers" from such hybridisation barriers exist, we crossed diploid or tetraploid A. thaliana mothers carrying a conditional male sterile mutation with a triploid Boechera apomict. These cross-pollinations generated zygotes and embryos. Most aborted or suffered multiple developmental defects at all stages of growth, but some seed matured and germinated. Seedlings grew slowly but eventually some developed into mature plants that were novel synthetic allopolyploid hybrids. With one exception, intertribal hybrids contained three Boechera plus either one or two A. thaliana genomes (depending on maternal ploidy) and were male and female sterile. The exception was a semi-fertile, sexual partial hybrid with one Boechera plus two A. thaliana genomes. The synthesis of "escapers" that survive rigorous early developmental challenges in crosses between A. thaliana and Boechera demonstrates that the inviability form of postzygotic reproductive isolation separating these distantly related species is not impenetrable. The recovery of a single semi-fertile partial hybrid also demonstrates that hybrid sterility, another form of postzygotic reproductive isolation, can be overcome between these species.	2012	10.1007/s00425-012-1612-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Lou, Haijuan; Dong, Lingli; Zhang, Kunpu; Wang, Da-Wei; Zhao, Maolin; Li, Yiwen; Rong, Chaowu; Qin, Huanju; Zhang, Aimin; Dong, Zhenying; Wang, Daowen	High-throughput mining of E-genome-specific SNPs for characterizing Thinopyrum elongatum introgressions in common wheat	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	Diploid Thinopyrum elongatum (EE, 2n=2x=14) and related polyploid species constitute an important gene pool for improving Triticeae grain and forage crops. However, the genomic and molecular marker resources are generally poor for these species. To aid the genetic, molecular, breeding and ecological studies involving Thinopyrum species, we developed a strategy for mining and validating E-genome-specific SNPs using Th. elongatum and common wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD, 2n=6x=42) as experimental materials. By comparing the transcriptomes between Chinese Spring (CS, a common wheat variety) and the CS-Th. elongatum octoploid, 35,193 candidate SNPs between E genome genes and their common wheat orthologs were computed. Through comparative genomic analysis, these SNPs were putatively assigned to the seven individual E genome chromosomes. Among 420 randomly selected SNPs, 373 could be validated. Thus, approximately 89% of the mined SNPs may be authentic with respect to their polymorphism and chromosomal location. Using 14 such SNPs as molecular markers, complex E genome introgressions were reliably identified in 78 common wheat-Th. elongatum hybrids, and the structural feature of a novel recombinant chromosome formed by 6E and 7E was revealed. Finally, based on testing 33 SNPs assigned to chromosome 3E in multiple genotypes of Th. elongatum, Pseudoroegneria stipifolia (carrying the St genome related to E) and common wheat, we suggest that some of the SNP markers may also be applicable for genetic studies within and among the Thinopyrum species (populations) carrying E and/or St genomes in the future.	2017	10.1111/1755-0998.12659		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Marker development	FALSE			FALSE	
Lu, Yijun; Xu, Yuting; Shi, Haobin; Zhang, Pengcong; Zhang, Huaiwei; Fug, Li	Feasibility of Electrochemical Fingerprinting for Plant Phylogeography Study: A Case of Chimonanthus praecox	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE	Investigation of plant relationships is very important in phylogeny and plant culture. In this work, we proposed an electrochemical fingerprint-based method for the investigation of Chimonanthus praecox from different locations. This is the first time that electrochemical fingerprinting technology has been applied to the study of the relationships between subspecies. Three buffer solutions were used as a solvents along with an electrolyte during the Chimonanthus praecox leaf extraction and fingerprint recording. The voltammetric curves of Chimonanthus praecox from different locations exhibited very similar profiles, confirming the feasibility of species identification based on the electrochemical fingerprint. A two-dimensional scatter pattern deduced from two sets of fingerprints was used to distinguish the locations. In addition, this phylogeographic study based on electrochemical fingerprinting suggested that Chimonanthus praecox has multisite and multitime origins.	2020	10.20964/2020.01.64		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	does not measure anything genetic	FALSE			FALSE	
Luan, Yang; Wang, Xiaoguang; Liu, Weihua; Li, Chunye; Zhang, Jinpeng; Gao, Ainong; Wang, Yandong; Yang, Xinming; Li, Lihui	Production and identification of wheat-Agropyron cristatum 6P translocation lines	PLANTA	The narrow genetic background of wheat is the primary factor that has restricted the improvement of crop yield in recent years. The kernel number per spike is the most important factor of the many potential characteristics that determine wheat yield. Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn., a wild relative of wheat, has the characteristics of superior numbers of florets and kernels per spike, which are controlled by chromosome 6P. In this study, the wheat-A. cristatum disomic addition and substitution lines were used as bridge materials to produce wheat-A. cristatum 6P translocation lines induced by gametocidal chromosomes and irradiation. The results of genomic in situ hybridization showed that the frequency of translocation induced by gametocidal chromosomes was 5.08%, which was higher than the frequency of irradiated hybrids (2.78%) and irradiated pollen (2.12%). The fluorescence in situ hybridization results of the translocation lines showed that A. cristatum chromosome 6P could be translocated to wheat ABD genome, and the recombination frequency was A genome > B genome > D genome. The alien A. cristatum chromosome 6P was translocated to wheat homoeologous groups 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. We obtained abundant translocation lines that possessed whole-arm, terminal, segmental and intercalary translocations. Three 6PS-specific and four 6PL-specific markers will be useful to rapidly identify and trace the translocated fragments. The different wheat-A. cristatum 6P translocation lines obtained in this study can provide basic materials for analyzing the alien genes carried by chromosome 6P. The translocation line WAT33-1-3 and introgression lines WAI37-2 and WAI41-1, which had significant characteristics of multikernel (high numbers of kernels per spike), could be utilized as novel germplasms for high-yield wheat breeding.	2010	10.1007/s00425-010-1187-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Luo, Xiao-Jin; Xin, Xiao-Yun; Yang, Jin-Shui	Genetic-basis analysis of heterotic loci in Dongxiang common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.)	GENETICS RESEARCH	Heterosis is widely used in genetic crop improvement; however, the genetic basis of heterosis is incompletely understood. The use of whole-genome segregating populations poses a problem for establishing the genetic basis of heterosis, in that interactions often mask the effects of individual loci. However, introgression line (IL) populations permit the partitioning of heterosis into defined genomic regions, eliminating a major part of the genome-wide epistasis. In our previous study, based on mid-parental heterosis (H-MP) value with single-point analysis, 42 heterotic loci (HLs) associated with six yield-related traits were detected in wild and cultivated rice using a set of 265 ILs of Dongxiang common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.). In this study, the genetic effects of HLs were determined as the combined effects of both additive and dominant gene actions, estimated from the performance values of testcross F(1)s and the dominance effects estimated from the H-MP values of testcross F(1)s. We characterized the gene action type at each HL. Thirty-eight of the 42 HLs were over-dominant, and in the absence of epistasis, four HLs were dominant. Therefore, we favour that over-dominance is a major genetic basis of 'wild-cultivar' crosses at the single functional Mendelian locus level.	2012	10.1017/S0016672312000250		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression ,lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Luo, Yuan; Lao, Liangyan; Ai, Bin; Zhang, Meng; Xie, Jiankun; Zhang, Fantao	Development of a drought stress-resistant rice restorer line through Oryza sativa-rufipogon hybridization	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Restorer line F6 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) has been widely used in hybrid rice breeding systems in southern China. However, line F6 is susceptible to drought stress, which restricts its utilization in many areas. Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR, Oryza rufipogon Griff.) has strong drought stress resistance, but the molecular factors responsible for drought resistance in DXWR remain unknown. In this study, we used the combination of phenotypic selection and molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) to improve the drought stress resistance of line F6 by introgression of qSDT12-2, a large effect drought stress-related quantitative trait locus identified in DXWR. Molecular MAS was carried out using linked marker RM1226, which is associated with qSDT12-2. Genomic background assessment was performed using 112 polymorphic markers. Finally, a stable drought stress-resistant backcross inbred line (BIL) was developed from a BC5F5 population, termed BIL627. Genetic constitution analysis revealed that the genome of BIL627 is almost identical (99.1%) to that of the restorer line F6. Further, BIL627 showed no yield penalty and no decrease in restoration ability under normal conditions. Taken together, our findings reveal the intrinsic value of using genetic resources present in wild species of Oryza to improve undesirable traits found in cultivated rice.	2019	10.1007/s12041-019-1105-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Luttikhuizen, Pieternella C.; Stift, Marc; Kuperus, Peter; Van Tienderen, Peter H.	Genetic diversity in diploid vs. tetraploid Rorippa amphibia (Brassicaceae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The frequency of polyploidy increases with latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, especially in deglaciated, recently colonized areas. The cause or causes of this pattern are largely unknown, but a greater genetic diversity of individual polyploid plants due to a doubled genome and/or a hybrid origin is seen as a likely factor underlying selective advantages related to life in extreme climates and/or colonization ability. A history of colonization in itself, as well as a recent origin, and possibly a limited number of polyploidization events would all predict less genetic diversity in polyploids than in diploids. The null hypothesis of higher gene diversity in polyploids has to date hardly been quantified and is here tested in self-incompatible Rorippa amphibia (Brassicaceae). The species occurs in diploid and tetraploid forms and displays clear geographical polyploidy in Europe. On the basis of eight microsatellite loci it can be concluded that the level of gene diversity is higher in tetraploids than in diploids, to an extent that is expected under neutral evolution when taking into account the larger effective population size in the doubled cytotype. There is thus no evidence for reduced genetic diversity in the tetraploids. The evidence presented here may mean that the tetraploids' origin is not recent, has not been affected by bottlenecks and/or that tetraploids were formed multiple times while an effect of introgression may also play a role.	2007	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03411.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Towards identifying and utilizing favourable alleles from O. nivara, we developed a set of introgression lines (ILs) by introducing O. nivara segments into the elite indica rice variety 93-11 background through advanced backcrossing and repeated selfing. Using whole-genome resequencing, a high-density genetic map containing 1,070 bin-markers was constructed for the 131 ILs, with an average length of 349 kb per bin. The 131 ILs cover 95% of O. nivara genome, providing a relatively complete genomic library for introgressing O. nivara alleles for trait improvement. Using this high-density bin-map, QTL mapping for 13 yield-related traits was performed and a total of 65 QTLs were detected across two environments. At similar to 36.9% of detected QTLs, the alleles from O. nivara conferred improving effects on yield-associated traits. Six cloned genes, Sh4/SHA1, Bh4, Sd1, TE/TAD1, GS3 and FZP, colocalised in the peak intervals of 9 QTLs. In conclusion, we developed new genetic materials for exploration and use of beneficial alleles from wild rice and provided a basis for future fine mapping and cloning of the favourable O. nivara-derived QTLs.	2016	10.1038/srep27425		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Macaya-Sanz, D.; Suter, L.; Joseph, J.; Barbara, T.; Alba, N.; Gonzalez-Martinez, S. C.; Widmer, A.; Lexer, C.	Genetic analysis of post-mating reproductive barriers in hybridizing European Populus species	HEREDITY	Molecular genetic analyses of experimental crosses provide important information on the strength and nature of post-mating barriers to gene exchange between divergent populations, which are topics of great interest to evolutionary geneticists and breeders. Although not a trivial task in long-lived organisms such as trees, experimental interspecific recombinants can sometimes be created through controlled crosses involving natural F(1)'s. Here, we used this approach to understand the genetics of post-mating isolation and barriers to introgression in Populus alba and Populus tremula, two ecologically divergent, hybridizing forest trees. We studied 86 interspecific backcross (BC(1)) progeny and >350 individuals from natural populations of these species for up to 98 nuclear genetic markers, including microsatellites, indels and single nucleotide polymorphisms, and inferred the origin of the cytoplasm of the cross with plastid DNA. Genetic analysis of the BC(1) revealed extensive segregation distortions on six chromosomes, and > 90% of these (12 out of 13) favored P. tremula donor alleles in the heterospecific genomic background. Since selection was documented during early diploid stages of the progeny, this surprising result was attributed to epistasis, cyto-nuclear coadaptation, heterozygote advantage at nuclear loci experiencing introgression or a combination of these. Our results indicate that gene flow across 'porous' species barriers affects these poplars and aspens beyond neutral, Mendelian expectations and suggests the mechanisms responsible. Contrary to expectations, the Populus sex determination region is not protected from introgression. Understanding the population dynamics of the Populus sex determination region will require tests based on natural interspecific hybrid zones.

Mackova, Lenka; Vit, Petr; Urfus, Tomas	Crop-to-wild hybridization in cherries-Empirical evidence from Prunus fruticosa	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Crop cultivation can lead to genetic swamping of indigenous species and thus pose a serious threat for biodiversity. The rare Eurasian tetraploid shrub Prunus fruticosa (ground cherry) is suspected of hybridizing with cultivated allochthonous tetraploid P. cerasus and autochthonous diploid P. avium. Three Prunus taxa (447 individuals of P. fruticosa, 43 of P. cerasus and 73 of P. avium) and their hybrids (198 individuals) were evaluated using analysis of absolute genome size/ploidy level and multivariate morphometrics. Flow cytometry revealed considerable differentiation in absolute genome size at the tetraploid level (average 2C of P. fruticosa = 1.30 pg, average 2C of P. cerasus = 1.42 pg, i.e., a 9.2% difference). The combination of methods used allowed us to ascertain the frequency of hybrids occurring under natural conditions in Central Europe. The morphological evaluation of leaves was based upon distance-based morphometrics supplemented by elliptic Fourier analysis. The results provided substantial evidence for ongoing hybridization (hybrids occurred in 39.5% of P. fruticosa populations). We detected homoploid introgressive hybridization with alien P. cerasus at the tetraploid level. We also found previously overlooked but frequent triploid hybrids resulting from heteroploid hybridization with indigenous P. avium, which, however, probably represent only the F1 generation. Although both hybrids differ in ploidy, they cannot be distinguished using morphometrics. Hybrids are frequent and may endanger wild populations of genuine P. fruticosa via direct niche competition or, alternatively or in addition, via introgression at the homoploid level (i.e., genetic swamping). The cultivation of cherries thus substantially threatens the existence of genuine P. fruticosa.	2018	10.1111/eva.12677		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	measures introgression using morphology	FALSE			FALSE

Srinivas	Marker assisted introgression of blast (Pi-2 and Pi-54) genes in to the genetic background of elite, bacterial blight resistant indica rice variety, Improved Samba Mahsuri	EUPHYTICA	Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM), a bacterial blight (BB) resistant (possessing Xa21, xa13 and xa5), high-yielding rice variety possessing fine-grain type has been recently released for cultivation and is becoming increasingly popular across many parts of India. However, the new variety is highly susceptible to blast disease, which limits its spread. In the present study, we attempted to improve blast resistance of ISM by introgressing two major blast resistance genes (Pi-2 and Pi-54) by marker-assisted backcross breeding through two separate sets of backcrosses, one involving transfer of Pi-2 and another involving Pi-54. At each backcross generation, closely linked PCR-based markers were used to select plants possessing either Pi-2 (first cross) or Pi-54 (second cross) along with Xa21, xa13 and microsatellite markers polymorphic between donor and recurrent parents were used to select plants that have maximum contribution from the recurrent parent genome (background selection). Selected BC2F1 plant possessing Pi-2 was intercrossed with a selected BC2F1 plant possessing Pi-54 and the resultant intercross F1 was selfed to generate intercross F1 possessing the two blast and two BB resistance genes. The intercross F1s were then selfed to generate intercross F2s possessing different combination of resistance genes in homozygous condition including the four-gene pyramid lines. The homozygous lines were advanced further through pedigree method of selection. When selected gene-pyramid lines possessing both blast and BB resistance genes were screened against the two diseases, they exhibited high level of disease resistance. Further, all the gene-pyramid lines possessed grain type identical to ISM and yielded equivalent to or better than the original variety. This is the first report documenting the stacking of two major genes for blast (Pi-2 ? Pi-54) and two major genes for BB (Xa21 ? xa13) in rice through marker-assisted backcross breeding in a elite cultivar Improved Samba Mahsuri.	2016	10.1007/s10681-016-1784-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression liens	FALSE			FALSE	
Mahe, Laetitia; Combes, Marie-Christine; Varzea, Vitor M. P.; Guilhaumon, Claire; Lashermes, Philippe	Development of sequence characterized DNA markers linked to leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) resistance in coffee (Coffea arabica L.)	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Coffee leaf rust due to Hemileia vastatrix is one of the most serious diseases in Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica). A resistance gene (S-H(3)) has been transferred from C. liberica into C. arabica. The present work aimed at developing sequence-characterized genetic markers for leaf rust resistance. Linkage between markers and leaf rust resistance was tested by analysing two segregating populations, one F-2 population of 101 individuals and one backcross (BC2) population of 43 individuals, derived from a cross between a susceptible and a SH3-introgressed resistant genotype. A total of ten sequence-characterized genetic markers closely associated with the SH3 leaf rust resistance gene were generated. These included simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers, sequence-characterised amplified regions (SCAR) markers resulting from the conversion of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers previously identified and SCAR markers derived from end-sequences of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. Those BAC clones were identified by screening of C. arabica genomic BAC library using a cloned AFLP-marker as probe. The markers we developed are easy and inexpensive to run, requiring one PCR step followed by gel separation. While three markers were linked in repulsion with the S-H(3) gene, seven markers were clustered in coupling around the S-H(3) gene. Notably, two markers appeared to co-segregate perfectly with the S-H(3) gene in the two plant populations analyzed. These markers are suitable for marker-assisted selection for leaf rust resistance and to facilitate pyramiding of the S-H(3) gene with other leaf rust resistance genes.	2008	10.1007/s11032-007-9112-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Mahelka, Vaclav; Fehrer, Judith; Krahulec, Frantisek; Jarolimova, Vlasta	Recent natural hybridization between two allopolyploid wheatgrasses (Elytrigia, Poaceae): Ecological and evolutionary implications	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims Natural hybridization was investigated between two predominantly allohexaploid wheatgrasses, weedy Elytrigia repens and steppic E. intermedia, with respect to habitats characterized by different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. Methods Using flow cytometry (relative DNA content), 269 plants from three localities were analysed. Hybrids were further analysed using nuclear ribosomal (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region) and chloroplast (trnT-F region) DNA markers in addition to absolute DNA content and chromosome numbers. Key Results Weedy E. repens was rare in a steppic locality whereas E. intermedia was almost absent at two sites of agricultural land-use. Nevertheless, hybrids were common there whereas none were found at the steppic locality, underlining the importance of different ecological conditions for hybrid formation or establishment. At one highly disturbed site, > 16 % of randomly collected plants were hybrids. Hexaploid hybrids showed intermediate genome size compared with the parents and additive patterns of parental ITS copies. Some evidence of backcrosses was found. The direction of hybridization was highly asymmetric as cpDNA identified E. intermedia as the maternal parent in 61 out of 63 cases. Out of nine nonaploid cytotypes (2n = 9x = 63) which likely originated by fusion of unreduced and reduced gametes of hexaploids, eight were hybrids whereas one was a nonaploid cytotype of E. repens. The progeny of one nonaploid hybrid demonstrated gene flow between hexaploid and nonaploid cytotypes. Conclusions The results show that E. repens and E. intermedia frequently cross at places where they co-occur. Hybrid frequency is likely influenced by habitat type; sites disturbed by human influence sustain hybrid formation and/or establishment. Hexaploid and nonaploid hybrid fertility is not negligible, backcrossing is possible, and the progeny is variable. The frequent production of new at least partially fertile cyto- and genotypes provides ample raw material for evolution and adaptation.	2007	10.1093/aob/mcm093		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	used morphology/some RFLPs to detect the presence of hybrids (but not introgression)	FALSE			FALSE

The near-isogenic lines (NILs) of HD2932 carrying Lr19, Sr26 and Yr10 were individually produced from two backcrosses with recurrent parent HD2932. Marker-assisted background selection of NILs with 94.38-98.46% of the HD2932 genome facilitated rapid recovery of NILs carrying Lr19, Sr26 and Yr10. In the BC2F2 generation, NILs were intercrossed and two gene combinations of Lr19+Yr10, Sr26 + Yr10 and Lr19+Sr26 were produced. A total of 16 progeny of two gene combinations of homozygous NILs of HD2932 have been produced, which are under seed increase for facilitating the replacement of the susceptible HD2932 with three of the sixteen improved backcross lines with resistance to multiple rusts.	2015	10.1111/pbr.12242		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Mallikarjuna, N; Jadhav, D; Reddy, P	Introgression of Cajanus platycarpus genome into cultivated pigeonpea, C-cajan	EUPHYTICA	Cajanus platycarpus, an incompatible wild species from the tertiary gene pool of pigeonpea (C. cajan (L.) Millspaugh), has many desirable characteristics for the improvement of cultivated varieties. To necessitate such transfers, embryo rescue techniques were used to obtain F-1 hybrids. The F-1 hybrids were treated with colchicine to obtain tetraploid hybrids, that were selfed to obtain F-2, F-3 and F-4 progenies. All of the hybrids and subsequent progenies had an intermediate morphology between the two parents. Backcrossing of the tetraploid hybrids with cultivated pigeonpea was not possible given embryo abortion, with smaller aborted embryos than those obtained in the F-0 parental cross. As a route of introgression, diploid F-1 hybrids were backcrossed with cultivated pigeonpea and BC1 progeny obtained by in vitro culture of aborting embryos. BC2 plants were obtained by normal, mature seed germination. Although embryo rescue techniques had to be used to obtain F-1 and BC1 plants, it was possible to produce BC2 and subsequent generations through direct mature seed. Every backcross to cultivated pigeonpea increased pollen fertility and the formation of mature seeds.	2006	10.1007/s10681-005-9063-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Mammadov, Jafar; Sun, Xiaochun; Gao, Yanxin; Ochsenfeld, Cherie; Bakker, Erica; Ren, Ruihua; Flora, Jonathan; Wang, Xiujuan; Kumpatla, Siva; Meyer, David; Thompson, Steve	Combining powers of linkage and association mapping for precise dissection of QTL controlling resistance to gray leaf spot disease in maize (Zea mays L.)	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Gray Leaf Spot (GLS causal agents Cercospora zeae-maydis and Cercospora zeina) is one of the most important foliar diseases of maize in all areas where the crop is being cultivated. Although in the USA the situation with GLS severity is not as critical as in sub-Saharan Africa or Brazil, the evidence of climate change, increasing corn monoculture as well as the narrow genetic base of North American resistant germplasm can turn the disease into a serious threat to US corn production. The development of GLS resistant cultivars is one way to control the disease. In this study we combined the high QTL detection power of genetic linkage mapping with the high resolution power of genome-wide association study (GWAS) to precisely dissect QTL controlling GLS resistance and identify closely linked molecular markers for robust marker-assisted selection and trait introgression. Results: Using genetic linkage analysis with a small bi-parental mapping population, we identified four GLS resistance QTL on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, and 8, which were validated by GWAS. GWAS enabled us to dramatically increase the resolution within the confidence intervals of the above-mentioned QTL. Particularly, GWAS revealed that QTLGLSchr8, detected by genetic linkage mapping as a locus with major effect, was likely represented by two QTL with smaller effects. Conducted in parallel, GWAS of days-to-silking demonstrated the co-localization of flowering time QTL with GLS resistance QTL on chromosome 7 indicating that either QTLGLSchr7 is a flowering time QTL or it is a GLS resistance QTL that co-segregates with the latter. As a result, this genetic linkage - GWAS hybrid mapping system enabled us to identify one novel GLS resistance QTL (QTLGLSchr8a) and confirm with more refined positions four more previously mapped QTL (QTLGLSchr1, QTLGLSchr6, QTLGLSchr7, and QTLGLSchr8b). Through the novel Single Donor vs. Elite Panel method we were able to identify within QTL confidence intervals SNP markers that would be suitable for marker-assisted selection of gray leaf spot resistant genotypes containing the above-mentioned GLS resistance QTL. Conclusion: The application of a genetic linkage -GWAS hybrid mapping system enabled us to dramatically increase the resolution within the confidence interval of GLS resistance QTL by-passing labor- and time-intensive fine mapping. This method appears to have a great potential to accelerate the pace of QTL mapping projects. It is universal and can be used in the QTL mapping projects in any crops.	2015	10.1186/s12864-015-2171-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Marasek-Ciolakowska, A.; He, H.; Bijman, P.; Ramanna, M. S.; Arens, P.; van Tuyl, J. M.	Assessment of intergenomic recombination through GISH analysis of F1, BC1 and BC2 progenies of Tulipa gesneriana and T. fosteriana	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Using 23 F1 hybrids, 14 BC1 and 32 BC2 progenies, the genome composition of Darwin hybrid tulips was analysed through genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) of somatic chromosomes. All plants were diploids (2n = 2x = 24) with the exception of one tetraploid BC1 (2n = 4x = 48) and one aneuploid BC2 (2n = 2x + 1 = 25) hybrid. Morphometric analysis in F1 hybrids revealed a difference in the total length of chromosomes representing genomes of T. gesneriana and T. fosteriana, where the percentage of each genome equaled 55.18 +/- A 0.8 and 44.92 +/- A 0.6% respectively. GISH distinguished chromosomes from both parent genomes although there was a lack of consistent chromosome labelling in some cases. In both T. gesneriana and T. fosteriana chromosomes some segments of heterochromatin in the telomeric and intercalary regions exhibited a higher intensity of fluorescence. In situ hybridisation with 5S rDNA and 45S rDNA probes to metaphase chromosomes of F1 hybrids showed that these regions are rich in rDNA. A notable feature was that, despite genome differences, there was a considerable amount of intergenomic recombination between the parental chromosomes of the two species as estimated in both BC1 and BC2 offspring. The number of recombinant chromosomes ranged from 3 to 8 in BC1 and from 1 to 7 in BC2 progenies. All recombinant chromosomes possessed mostly a single recombinant segment derived from either a single crossover event or in a few cases double crossover events. This explains the fact that, unlike the situation in most F1 hybrids of other plant species, certain genotypes of Darwin hybrid tulips behave like normal diploid plants producing haploid gametes and give rise to mostly diploid sporophytes.	2012	10.1007/s00606-012-0598-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Cytogenetic study	FALSE			FALSE

Introgression of Chromosome Segments of Tulipa fosteriana into T. gesneriana Detected through GISH and Its Implications for Breeding Virus Resistant Tulips	X INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FLOWER BULBS AND HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS	Hybridization between Tulipa gesneriana cultivars (G, 2n=2x=24) and Darwin hybrids (T. gesneriana x T. fosteriana; 2n=2x=24) was made with the aim of transferring desirable horticultural traits from Tulipa fosteriana (F) to T. gesneriana. The genome composition and the extent of intergenomic recombination in a number of diploid progenies (2n=2x=24) was evaluated by genomic in situ hybridization technique (GISH) using differently labelled total genomic DNAs of 'Princeps' (T. fosteriana) and 'Ile de France' (T. gesneriana). In all progenies analysed, it was possible to distinguish chromosomes from both parental genomes as well as the recombinant chromosomes. The number of T. fosteriana chromosomes as well as the number and type of recombinant chromosomes differed among progenies. The total number of intact T. fosteriana chromosomes in hybrids ranged from zero to three whereas the maximum number of recombinant T. fosteriana chromosomes was five. Among recombinant chromosomes, most contained a combination of a single T. gesneriana and a single T. fosteriana fragment. The maximum number of recombinant segments per chromosome was two and their position ranged from distal to highly interstitial. The Darwin hybrids turned out to be very useful intermediate parents for introgressing the T. fosteriana germplasm into the T. gesneriana assortment.	2011			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Introgression Breeding in Genus Tulipa Analysed by GISH	XXIII INTERNATIONAL EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM, SECTION ORNAMENTALS: COLOURFUL BREEDING AND GENETICS	Interspecific hybridization is an important tool in tulip breeding to transfer some important horticultural traits into new cultivars. The diploid (2n=2x=24) F-1 interspecific hybrids between T. gesneriana x T. fosteriana (GF) were backcrossed to diploid T. gesneriana cultivar ` Yellow Flight' (G). BC1 plants resulting from these crosses were analysed by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) to estimate their genome constitution and extent and position of intergenomic recombination. All of the BC1 progenies analysed were diploid (2n=2x=24). GISH enabled unequivocally the identification of parental chromosomes as well as the recombinant chromosomes. Because the T. gesneriana parent was used for backcrossing, the number of G genome chromosomes (chromosomes with centormere of T. gesneriana genome) predominated in the BC1 progenies. The total number of T. fosteriana chromosomes in hybrids ranged from four to ten. There were two types of recombinant chromosomes. Those with a centromere of T. fosteriana chromosome with recombinant segment of T. gesneriana (F/G) and vice versa (G/F). Most recombinant chromosomes contained a single crossover. The percentages of T. fosteriana chromatin in BC1 hybrids ranged from 20 to 24%.	2009			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Meiotic Polyploidization in Darwin Hybrid Tulips	XXIV INTERNATIONAL EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM SECTION ORNAMENTALS: ORNAMENTAL BREEDING WORLDWIDE	In our study, 2n gamete producing F-1 hybrids of Darwin hybrids (T. gesneriana x T. fosteriana) have been selected and used as pollen donor with the aim of producing of polyploid tulips. In total, 308 one-year-old BC1 seedlings resulting from crosses between diploid and triploid T. gesneriana cultivars and diploid 2n gametes producers have been tested by flow cytometry analysis. Complementary, chromosome number and genome composition was evaluated for selected genotypes through genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis. The progenies from crosses at diploid level (2x x 2x) were mostly diploids, whereas a few seedlings were triploids. In crosses 3x x 2x, 81 genotypes were tetraploids and 25 seedlings were pentaploids. Cytological analyses using GISH of the sexual polyploid progenies have shown considerable amounts of intergenomic recombination in the BC1 generations which is desirable for introgression breeding.	2012			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Marasek-Ciolakowska, Agnieszka; Xie, Songlin; Arens, Paul; van Tuyl, Jaap M.	Ploidy manipulation and introgression breeding in Darwin hybrid tulips	EUPHYTICA	Meiotic polyploidisation via crossing with 2n gamete producing genotypes and interploidy crosses are two of the main methods currently used to obtain polyploid tulips. In our study diploid 2n gamete producing F-1 hybrids of Darwin hybrids (Tulipa gesneriana x Tulipa fosteriana) and triploid hybrid resulting from 'Rhodos' x 'Princeps' cross were used as pollen donor and crossed with cultivars of T. gesneriana in the following combination: 2x x 2x, 3x x 2x, 2x x 3x, and 3x x 3x. The progenies resulting from crosses at diploid level were mostly diploid, whereas a few seedlings were triploid. In 3x x 2x crosses aneuploids with chromosome constitution in between triploid and tetraploid (43-45 chromosomes) were predominant, but also one tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) and four pentaploids (2n = 5x = 60) were obtained. In 2x x 3x crosses most progenies were triploid with the exception of a few aneuploids (3x + 1 and 3x - 1), whereas in 3x x 3x cross diploid and aneuploid genotypes were recorded with chromosome number varied from 27 to 34. These results indicate that triploid parents produced aneuploid as well as euploid (x, 2x, 3x) gametes and that success in ploidy manipulation in tulip depends to a large degree on the ploidy level of the parental genotypes used for hybridization. Genome constitution of selected population of F1 and BC1 hybrids was analyzed through genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). GISH analysis of the BC1 showed a considerable amount of intergenomic recombination which is desirable for introgression breeding.	2014	10.1007/s10681-014-1115-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Marasek, Agnieszka; Okazaki, Keiichi	Analysis of introgression of the Tulipa fosteriana genome into Tulipa gesneriana using GISH and FISH	EUPHYTICA	Southern hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) have demonstrated that 'Purissima' (2n = 2x = 24) is an interspecific hybrid comprised of one genome of Tulipa (T.) gesneriana and one genome of T. fosteriana. Backcrossing T. gesneriana with 'Purissima' was partially successful. Simultaneous GISH and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) distinguished chromosomes from both parent genomes, as well as recombinant chromosomes, in interspecific hybrids and their progeny. Chromosome recombination was observed in all cultivars except 'Purissima' and 'Kouki' (2n = 3x = 36). 'Kouki' (2n = 3x = 36) had two genomes of the T. gesneriana and a single genome of the T. fosteriana. The number of nonrecombinant T. fosteriana chromosomes in 'Judith Leyster' (2n = 4x = 48) and 'Purissima' progeny varied from two in 'Hatsuzakura' to six in 'Kikomachi' and 'Momotaro'. The number and type of recombinant chromosomes also differed among cultivars. The total number of translocations ranged from one in 'Kikomachi' to six in 'Hatsuzakura'. Each was a combination of a single T. fosteriana fragment and a single T. gesneriana fragment, indicating that they resulted from a single crossover event. Sequential GISH and FISH analysis with rDNA probes yielded chromosome-specific markers that were used to identify most of the chromosomes in 'Purissima' progeny. This is the first report of introgression of T. fosteriana chromatin into the T. gesneriana genome.	2008	10.1007/s10681-007-9539-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytopgenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Martin, A; Cabrera, A	Cytogenetics of Hordeum chilense: current status and considerations with reference to breeding	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	Hordeum chilense Roem. et Schult. has a number of characteristics interesting for breeding: high crossability with other Triticeae, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and high variability for quality traits such as endosperm storage proteins or carotenoid content. x Tritordeum, the amphiploids between H. chilense and different Triticum spp, are bridge species which facilitate the transfer of traits from H. chilense to wheat or triticale. The chromosome pairing between H. chilense and wheat chromosomes is very low ( if existing) even in the absence of the action of the Ph1 gene. Nevertheless, translocation between H. chilense and wheat chromosomes has been observed frequently in genomic combinations where univalents of both species are present and therefore a method is available for using H. chilense in wheat or triticale breeding. Hybrids and amphiploids with other crop species of the Triticeae, such as rye or barley, have also been obtained, although to date the production of stable introgression stocks has not been completed. The technique of chromosome painting, using both high- and low-repeated DNA sequences in combination with genomic in situ hybridization have been used as effective methods for basic cytogenetic research in H. chilense, allowing analysis of genome evolution, and monitoring H. chilense chromosomes in interspecific hybridization breeding programs.

Martin, NH; Bouck, AC; Arnold, ML	Detecting adaptive trait introgression between Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis in highly selective field conditions	GENETICS	The idea that: natural hybridization has served as an important force in evolutionary and adaptive diversification has gained considerable momentum in recent. years. By combining genome analyses with a highly selective field experiment, we provide evidence for adaptive trait introgression between two naturally hybridizing Louisiana Iris species, flood-tolerant hi, fulva and dry-adapted L brevicaulis We planted reciprocal backcross (BC1) hybrids along With pure-species plants into natural settings that, due to a flooding event, favored I. fulva. As expected, L fulva plant, survived at much higher rates than I. brevicaulis plants. Backcross hybrids toward I. fulva (BCIF) also survived at significantly higher rates than the reciprocal backcross toward L brevicaulis (BCIB). Survivorship of BCIB hybrids was strongly influenced by the presence of a number of introgressed L fulva, alleles located throughout the genome, while survivorship in the reciprocal BCIF hybrids was heavily influenced by two epistatically acting QTL of opposite effects. These results demonstrate the potential for adaptive trait introgression between these two species and may help to explain patterns of genetic variation observed in naturally occurring hybrid zones.	2006	10.1534/genetics.105.053538		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Martin, NH; Bouck, AC; Arnold, ML	Loci affecting long-term hybrid survivorship in Louisiana irises: Implications for reproductive isolation and introgression	EVOLUTION	Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis are long-lived plant species known to hybridize where they coexist in nature. Year-to-year survival contributes significantly to overall fitness for both species and their hybrid derivatives, and differences in hybrid survivability may have important consequences to interspecific gene flow in nature. We examined the genetic architecture of long-term survivorship of reciprocal backcross I. fulva x I. brevicaulis hybrids in a common-garden, greenhouse environment. Differences in mortality were found between the two backcross (BC1) hybrid classes, with hybrids crossed toward I. fulva (BCIF) revealing twice the mortality of those hybrids backcrossed toward I. brevicaulis (BCIB). Using genomic scans on two separate genetic linkage maps derived from the reciprocal hybrid populations, we found that hybrid survivorship is influenced by several genetic regions. Multiple interval mapping (MIM) revealed four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in BCIF hybrids that were significantly associated with survivorship. Introgressed I. brevicaulis DNA increased survivorship at three of the four QTLs. For the fourth QTL, introgressed I. brevicaulis DNA was associated with decreased survivorship. No QTLs were detected in BCIB hybrids; however, single-marker analysis revealed five unlinked loci that were significantly associated with survivorship. At all five markers, survivorship was positively associated with introgressed I. fulva DNA. The present findings have important implications for the evolutionary dynamics of naturally occurring hybrid zones. Regions of the genome that increase survivorship when in a heterozygous (i.e., hybrid) state should have an increased likelihood of passing across species boundaries, whereas those that decrease survivorship will be less likely to introgress.	2005			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE

Application of Genomic and Quantitative Genetic Tools to Identify Candidate Resistance Genes for Brown Rot Resistance in Peach	PLOS ONE	The availability of a complete peach genome assembly and three different peach genome sequences created by our group provide new opportunities for application of genomic data and can improve the power of the classical Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) approaches to identify candidate genes for peach disease resistance. Brown rot caused by Monilinia spp., is the most important fungal disease of stone fruits worldwide. Improved levels of peach fruit rot resistance have been identified in some cultivars and advanced selections developed in the UC Davis and USDA breeding programs. Whole genome sequencing of the Pop-DF parents lead to discovery of high-quality SNP markers for QTL genome scanning in this experimental population. Pop-DF created by crossing a brown rot moderately resistant cultivar 'Dr. Davis' and a brown rot resistant introgression line, 'F8,1-42', derived from an initial almond x peach interspecific hybrid, was evaluated for brown rot resistance in fruit of harvest maturity over three seasons. Using the SNP linkage map of Pop-DF and phenotypic data collected with inoculated fruit, a genome scan for QTL identified several SNP markers associated with brown rot resistance. Two of these QTLs were placed on linkage group 1, covering a large (physical) region on chromosome 1. The genome scan for QTL and SNP effects predicted several candidate genes associated with disease resistance responses in other host-pathogen systems. Two potential candidate genes, ppa011763m and ppa026453m, may be the genes primarily responsible for M. fructicola recognition in peach, activating both PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) responses. Our results provide a foundation for further genetic dissection, marker assisted breeding for brown rot resistance, and development of peach cultivars resistant to brown rot.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0078634		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

We produced trigenomic Brassica interspecific hybrids (genome complements AABC, BBAC and CCAB) from the amphidiploid species Brassica napus (AACC), Brassica juncea (AABB) and Brassica carinata (BBCC) in order to test whether the structure of each genome affects frequencies of homologous and homoeologous (both allosyndetic and autosyndetic) pairing during meiosis. AABC hybrids produced from three genotypes of B. napus were included to assess the genetic control of homoeologous pairing. Multi-colour fluorescent in situ hybridisation was used to quantify homologous pairing (e.g. A-genome bivalents in AABC), allosyndetic associations (e.g. B-C in AABC) and autosyndetic associations (e.g. B-B in AABC) at meiosis. A high percentage of homologous chromosomes formed pairs (97.5-99.3%), although many pairs were also involved in autosyndetic and allosyndetic associations. Allosyndesis was observed most frequently as A-C genome associations (mean 4.0 per cell) and less frequently as A-B genome associations (0.8 per cell) and B-C genome associations (0.3 per cell). Autosyndesis occurred most frequently in the haploid A genome (0.75 A-A per cell) and least frequently in the haploid B genome (0.13 B-B per cell). The frequency of C-C autosyndesis was greater in BBAC hybrids (0.75 per cell) than in any other hybrid. The frequency of A-B, A-C and B-C allosyndesis was affected by the genomic structure of the trigenomic hybrids. Frequency of allosyndesis was also influenced by the genotype of the B. napus paternal parent for the three AABC (B. juncea x B. napus) hybrid types. Homoeologous pairing between the Brassica A, B and C genomes in interspecific hybrids may be influenced by complex interactions between genome structure and allelic composition.	2010	10.1007/s10577-010-9140-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Genotypic effects on the frequency of homoeologous and homologous recombination in Brassica napus x B. carinata hybrids	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	We investigated the influence of genotype on homoeologous and homologous recombination frequency in eight different Brassica napus (AAC(n)C(n)) x B. carinata ((BBCCc)-C-c) interspecific hybrids (genome composition C(n)C(c)AB). Meiotic recombination events were assessed through microsatellite marker analysis of 67 unreduced microspore-derived progeny. Thirty-four microsatellite markers amplified 83 A-, B-, C-n- and C-c-genome alleles at 64 loci, of which a subset of seven markers amplifying 26 alleles could be used to determine allele copy number. Hybrid genotypes varied significantly in loss of A- and B-genome alleles (P < 0.0001), which ranged from 6 to 22% between hybrid progeny sets. Allele copy number analysis revealed 19 A-C, 3 A-B and 10 B-C duplication/deletion events attributed to homoeologous recombination. Additionally, 55 deletions and 19 duplications without an accompanying dosage change in homoeologous alleles were detected. Hybrid progeny sets varied in observed frequencies of loss, gain and exchange of alleles across the A and B genomes as well as in the diploid C genome. Self-fertility in hybrid progeny decreased as the loss of B-genome loci (but not A-genome loci) increased. Hybrid genotypes with high levels of homologous and homoeologous exchange may be exploited for genetic introgressions between B. carinata and B. napus (canola), and those with low levels may be used to develop stable synthetic Brassica allopolyploids.	2011	10.1007/s00122-010-1468-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE

NOVEL GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THE ALIEN D-GENOME SYNTHETIC HEXAPLOID WHEAT (2n=6x=42, AABBDD) GERMPLASM FOR VARIOUS PHENOLOGY TRAITS	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	The current study evaluates genetic penetrance and expressivity of an alien genome introgression in a set of 117 primary synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) accessions. These SHW's have originated from durum wheat /accessions with three sets of durum wheat cultivars ALTAR 84, D67.2 and CERCETA as the female and diverse Ae. tauschii accessions as the pollen parents. Diversity of the 12 important traits (Growth habit, pigmentation, chlorophyll content, leaf area index, crop digital ground cover, awn size, awn length, and several seed digital imaging parameters)revealed significant variation for the respective traits, leading to the conclusion that Ae. tauschii accessions have tremendous diversity than the durum controls. Further, the value deviations within each attribute had a range of being lower or higher than their durum wheat female parents and these observations allowed us to use the variations as selective sieves and narrow down the desirable SHW's that would be advantageous to exploit for wheat breeding and cultivar improvement programs. Selections were made and a group of 41SHWaccessions were identified that will after an intermediate DNA diversity evaluation form a crisper final set for user friendly utilization. The range of selections shows multiple trait advantages for exploitation in both irrigated and rain-fed conditions. This pivotal study sets the foundation to better define the D genome SHW's for efficient utilization in future research investigations.

Marker-Assisted Breeding in Higher Plants	ALTERNATIVE FAMING SYSTEMS, BIOTECHNOLOGY, DROUGHT STRESS AND ECOLOGICAL FERTILISATION	The deployment of DNA-based marker systems promises to accelerate the improvement of crop productivity worldwide. Numerous DNA fingerprinting assays, and more recently whole genome sequence information, have been utilized extensively for employing intrinsic genetic polymorphisms in the genomes of higher plants in phylogenetic studies, genetic mapping, and comparative genomic analysis. DNA markers set the stage for initiating genomic-based breeding strategies with several advantages over the phenotypic based selection procedures used in conventional breeding programs. In maize, successful applications have been exemplified by marker assisted introgression of novel genomic regions associated with anthesis-silking interval, marker-based diagnosis of plants containing the opaque2 gene associated with quality, and marker-based prediction of hybrid vigor. New rice varieties are developed using DNA markers associated with genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to provide resistance to both biotic stress, e.g. bacterial blight and blast, and abiotic stresses, and to improve yield and quality. A wheat variety 'Patwin' was developed through marker assisted selection for stripe and leaf rust resistance genes Yr17 and Lr37, respectively. The stay-green trait conferring resistance to drought in sorghum has been explored at length. In tomato, cotton, potato, soybean and other crops, many genes conferring resistance against various biotic stresses have been incorporated from wild relatives using DNA markers. Wider adaptation of marker assisted breeding is limited by the narrow genetic base of elite gene pools for many plants. Multiple investigations reveal conservation of QTLs among some crop species, offering opportunities to gain information from one crop to improve others.	2011	10.1007/978-94-007-0186-1_3	10.1007/978-94-007-0186-1	Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Mercer, Kristin L.; Wyse, Donald L.; Shaw, Ruth G.	Effects of competition on the fitness of wild and crop-wild hybrid sunflower from a diversity of wild populations and crop lines	EVOLUTION	Gene flow between crop fields and wild populations often results in hybrids with reduced fitness compared to their wild counterparts due to characteristics imparted by the crop genome. But the specifics of the evolutionary outcome of crop-wild gene flow may depend on context, varying due to local environmental conditions and genetic variation within and among wild populations and among crop lines. To evaluate context-dependence of fitness of F, hybrids, sunflower crop lines were crossed with nine wild populations from across the northern United States. These crop-wild hybrids and their wild counterparts were grown under agricultural conditions in the field with and without wheat competition. Hybrids were far less fecund than wild plants, yet more likely to survive to reproduce. There was considerable variability among wild populations for fecundity and the specific crop line used to generate the crop-wild hybrid significantly affected fecundity. The fitness deficit suffered by crop-wild hybrids varied by population, as did the rankings of the crop-wild hybrids from three different crop lines. Wheat competition decreased fecundity and survival considerably and hampered seed production of wild plants more than that of hybrids. Genotype X environment interactions indicated that the response of fitness to competition differed by population. Consequently, the fitness of hybrids relative to wild plants varied considerably among wild populations and was not consistent across environments. Notably, relative fitness of hybrids was greater under competitive conditions.

Mergeai, G	Cotton improvement through interspecific hybridization	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES	For more than forty years, investigations have been carried out at the Gembloux Agricultural University, Belgium, to genetically improve the main cultivated cotton species (Gossypium hirsutum L.) through interspecific hybridization. This work has led to the development of one of the largest collection of cotton interspecific hybrids in the world made of 21 bispecific diploids, 12 bispecific triploids, 6 bispecific synthetic allotetraploids, 8 trispecific synthetic allotetraploids, 11 bispecific synthetic allohexaploids, 11 bispecific pentaploids and 13 monosomic alien addition lines involving species of A, B, C, D, E, F and G genomes of genus Gossypium. Cytological analyses were carried out on some of these hybrid genotypes to determine the genetic relationships of the different species involved in their development and to assess the possibility to exploit them in breeding programs. During the first thirty years, the priority of the investigations was to improve the technological quality of the lint (strength, length, fineness. and elasticity). Two recurrent selection programs were carried out in collaboration with l'Institut national pour l'etude agronomique all Congo (Ineac) and now the Institut National Pour l'Etude et la Recherche Agronomiques (Inera) in the Congo Democratic Republic to develop improved cultivars from G, arboreum L. x G. thurberi Tod. x G. hirsutum trispecific hybrid, and from G. hirsutum x G, anomalum Wawra, G. hirsutum x G. thurberi! and G. hirsutum x G. raimondii Ulb. bispecific hybrids. Complementary work in this field was realized to assess the possibility to use a G. hirsutum x G. areysianum Hutch, hybrid to simultaneously improve the strength and the elasticity of the fiber. Over the last ten years, researches have been focused on the improvement of the quality of the seed, by trying to develop upland cotton commercial varieties presenting the glanded-plant and glandless-seed trait of G. sturtianum Wil. and on increasing the resistance of cotton to reniform nematodes (Rotylenchulus reniformis Lind. & Oliveira) by exploiting the immunity to this pest presented by G. longicalyx Hutch & Lee. A last program concerns the assessment of the possibility to exploit Australian diploid species (C and G genome species) through the development of bi-specific hybrids with G. hirsutum. DNA marker-assisted (RAPD, RFLP, AFLP, SSR) selection methods and in situ hybridization techniques were introduced in these new programs in collaboration with the Centre de cooperation internationale en recherche agronomique pour le developpement-Departement Cultures annuelles (Cirad-CA (Cirad-CA, France). The main achievements of this research work are presented and the prospects Of using interspecific hybrids in the future to improve cotton are discussed.	2006			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	no access; but looks like review	FALSE			FALSE	
Mi, Jiaming; Yang, Dabing; Chen, Yi; Jiang, Jiefeng; Mou, Haipeng; Huang, Junbin; Ouyang, Yidan; Mou, Tongmin	Accelerated molecular breeding of a novel P/TGMS line with broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight in two-line hybrid rice	RICE	Background: Breeding two-line hybrid rice with disease resistance is an effective approach to stabilize rice yield in commercial rice production of China. Results: We improved the blast and bacterial blight resistance of Guangzhan63-4S, an elite photoperiod-and thermo-sensitive male sterile (P/TGMS) line widely used in two-line hybrid rice, by introducing the R genes Pi2 and Xa7 conferring resistance to rice blast and bacterial blight, respectively. Through the backcrossing and gene pyramiding breeding coupled with molecular marker-assisted selection, a new P/TGMS line Hua1228S carrying Pi2, Xa7, and tms5 was developed. Based on 200,000 SNP markers by next-generation sequencing, Hua1228S covered 87.6% of the recurrent genome, as well as 4.5% of the donor genome from VE6219 and 7.9% from YR7029-39. When infected with seven tested Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, Hua1228S conferred high resistance (0 level) to six bacterial blight strains. Moreover, Hua1228S showed broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast isolates with a high resistance frequency of 90.91%. High levels of resistance to leaf blast and neck blast were observed under heavy disease pressure in natural field. Importantly, Hua1228S showed identical fertility-sterility alteration pattern to Guangzhan63-4S. Thus, two hybrid combinations Hua Liangyou 2821 and Hua Liangyou 284 derived from Hua1228S exhibited enhanced resistance and higher yield compared with the control variety Feng Liangyou 4. Conclusions: These results indicate that Hua1228S has tremendous potentiality to increase and stabilize the rice yield, through the introgression of two R genes by marker-assisted selection strategy.	2018	10.1186/s12284-018-0203-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Miedaner, T.; Mueller, B. U.; Piepho, H. -P.; Falke, K. C.	Genetic architecture of plant height in winter rye introgression libraries	PLANT BREEDING	P>Plant height is an important trait for breeding and as fitness criterion in natural populations of rye (Secale cereale L.). Our objectives were to investigate the inheritance of plant height in rye introgression libraries and estimate the covariation between per se and testcross performance. Two introgression libraries containing each of 40 BC2S3 candidate introgression lines (pre-ILs) were tested at five locations in two years for per se and testcross performance. Donor population was the Iranian primitive rye accession Altevogt 14160. Plant height of the donor population was 145 +/- 3.6 cm as population and 152 +/- 2.9 and 132 +/- 2.8 cm when crossed to the two testers, respectively. Pre-ILs were much closer to the recurrent parent, but still most of them exceeded the recurrent parent in per se performance. Estimates of the genotypic variance were significant (P = 0.01) for both per se and testcross performance. Entry-mean heritabilities were high in both libraries (0.97 and 0.94, respectively). Donor chromosome segments (DCS) of 59 of 72 pre-ILs had a significant (P = 0.05) effect on plant height compared to the recurrent parent. For the testcrosses, 10 pre-ILs still contributed DCS with significantly (P = 0.05) taller effects. Genotypic correlations between pre-ILs per se and as testcrosses were moderate for the two testers. In conclusion, plant height per se has a complex inheritance with many loci spread across the entire genome. Hybrid breeding, however, facilitates the use of genetic resources because the tallness is less pronounced in the testcrosses.	2011	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01823.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Mo, Jiaxing; Xu, Jin; Cao, Yuting; Yang, Liwei; Yin, Tongming; Hua, Hui; Zhao, Hui; Guo, Zhenhao; Yang, Junjie; Shi, Jisen	Pinus massoniana Introgression Hybrids Display Differential Expression of Reproductive Genes	FORESTS	Pinus massoniana and P. hwangshanensis are two conifer species located in southern China, which are of both economic and ornamental value. Around the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, P. massoniana occurs mainly at altitudes below 700 m, while P. hwangshanensis can be found above 900 m. At altitudes where the distribution of both pines overlaps, a natural introgression hybrid exists, which we will further refer to as the Z pine. This pine has a morphological character that shares attributes of both P. massoniana and P. hwangshanensis. However, compared to the other two pines, its reproductive structure, the pinecone, has an ultra-low ripening rate with seeds that germinate poorly. In this study, we aimed to find the reason for the impaired cone maturation by comparing transcriptome libraries of P. massoniana and Z pine cones at seven successive growth stages. After sequencing and assembly, we obtained unigenes and then annotated them against NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide and protein sequences, Swiss-Prot, Clusters of Orthologous Groups, Gene Ontology and KEGG Orthology databases. Gene expression levels were estimated and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the two pines were mined and analyzed. We found that several of them indeed relate to reproductive process. At every growth stage, these genes are expressed at a higher level in P. massoniana than in the Z pine. These data provide insight into understanding which molecular mechanisms are altered between P. massoniana and the Z pine that might cause changes in the reproductive process.	2019	10.3390/f10030230		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Mo, Jiaxing; Xu, Jin; Jin, Wenjing; Yang, Liwei; Yin, Tongming; Shi, Jisen	Identification of Reference Genes for Quantitative Gene Expression Studies in Pinus massoniana and Its Introgression Hybrid	FORESTS	qRT-PCR is a powerful molecular research tool to study the regulation of gene expression. However, to accurately calculate gene expression levels, an experiment should include proper reference genes that show no changes in their expression level. Pinus massoniana, P. hwangshanensis, and their introgression hybrid in Mountain Lushan, China, are an ideal model for studying introgression and speciation. Although some research on reference gene selection for P. massoniana has been reported before, no studies on this subject have been performed where P. massoniana and its introgression hybrid were evaluated simultaneously. Here, we investigated ten genes (upLOC, SDH, ACT, EF, TOC75, DMWD, FBOX, PGK1, UBQ, and CL2417C7) identified from transcriptome data of these two taxa for reference gene potential. These ten genes were then screened across multiple tissues such as cone, young and mature stems, and young needles according to qRT-PCR thermal cycling and dissociation. Correlation coefficient, amplification efficiency, and cycle threshold value (Ct) range were applied to evaluate the reliability of each gene. The stability of candidate reference gene expression was calculated using three algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Base on the reliability and stability, we then offered a list of genes of recommended and not recommended for seven different tissue type and species. Our results demonstrated that different sample lines require different genes as reference to evaluate.	2019	10.3390/f10090787		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Marker development	FALSE			FALSE	
Mohanty, Aparajita; Chrungu, Babeeta; Verma, Nidhi; Shivanna, Kundaranahalli Ramalingaiah	Broadening the Genetic Base of Crop Brassicas by Production of New Intergeneric Hybrid	CZECH JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING	Wide hybridization between crop brassicas and their wild relatives is an important approach towards increasing the genetic variability, which can be utilised for brassica breeding programs. A new intergeneric hybrid between Erucastrum cardaminoides and Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra was produced using embryo rescue techniques. The F, hybrid was intermediate between the male and female parent for most of the morphological characters. Cytological studies of pollen mother cells of the hybrid revealed a preponderance of univalents at metaphase I. The number of bivalents in the digenomic hybrid was lower than expected. However, the presence of trivalent and quadrivalent in cells indicated some homoeology between the two genomes and hence the possibility of introgression of genes into the cultivar. The first backcross progeny was obtained using B. oleracea var. alboglabra as the pollen parent. Further, it is being used for developing new alloplasmic lines. The intergeneric hybrid was also used as bridge species to transfer wild (E. cardaminoides) cytoplasm to B. napus and B. carinata. The new intergeneric hybrid and bridge cross hybrids produced in the present investigation have contributed towards increasing the genic and cytoplasmic variability and thus broadening the genetic base of crop brassicas.	2009	10.17221/35/2009-CJGPB		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Abdul	Analysis of Simple Sequence Repeat Markers Linked to Submergence Tolerance on Newly Developed Rice Lines Derived from MR263 x Swarna-Sub1	SAINS MALAYSIANA	Nowadays, in extreme changing environments, development of submergence tolerance variety is necessary for ensuring crop production stability where, it is known that Malaysian commercial rice varieties such as MR219, MR220 and MR263 were severely susceptible to submergence. First step towards the development of submergence tolerance variety starts with the breeding program by crossing MR263 and Swarna-Sub1. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) was carried out through the utilization of simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers, considering its reliability as pre-selection tools to conduct this research. F-1 generations plants were confirmed by tightly linked markers. In case of background study, out of 180 SSR markers, 38 were found polymorphic between two parents. Association of molecular markers and submergence tolerance were determined using Chi-square test. MR263 x Swarna-Sub1 F-2 lines were tested for Sub1 gene conformation using the markers RM8300 and RM219. These markers showed a good fit to the expected marker segregation ratio (1: 2: 1) in a Mendelian single gene model (DF= 1.0, p <= 0.05). Eleven homozygous lines with Sub1 gene out of 256 were selected for future development of submergence tolerant varieties. Eleven lines were selected based on phenotypic study and agronomic performance.	2017	10.17576/jsm-2017-4604-02		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Molnar-Lang, Marta; Kruppa, Klaudia; Cseh, Andras; Bucsi, Julianna; Linc, Gabriella	Identification and phenotypic description of new wheat - six-rowed winter barley disomic additions	GENOME	To increase the allelic variation in wheat-barley introgressions, new wheat-barley disomic addition lines were developed containing the 2H, 3H, 4H, 6H, and 7H chromosomes of the six-rowed Ukrainian winter barley 'Manas'. This cultivar is agronomically much better adapted to Central European environmental conditions than the two-rowed spring barley 'Betzes' previously used. A single 'Asakaze' x 'Manas' wheat x barley hybrid plant was multiplied in vitro and one backcross plant was obtained after pollinating 354 regenerant hybrids with wheat. The addition lines were selected from the self-fertilized seeds of the 16 BC2 plants using genomic in situ hybridization. The addition lines were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization using repetitive DNA probes (HvT01, GAA, pTa71, and Afa family), followed by confirmation with barley SSR markers. The addition lines were grown in the phytotron and in the field, and morphological parameters (plant height, fertility, tillering, and spike characteristics) were measured. The production of the disomic additions will make it possible to incorporate the DNA of six-rowed winter barley into the wheat genome. Addition lines are useful for genetic studies on the traits of six-rowed winter barley and for producing new barley dissection lines.	2012	10.1139/G2012-013		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression ,lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Molnar, Istvan; Simkova, Hana; Leverington-Waite, Michelle; Goram, Richard; Cseh, Andras; Vrana, Jan; Farkas, Andras; Dolezel, Jaroslav; Molnar-Lang, Marta; Griffiths, Simon	Syntenic Relationships between the U and M Genomes of Aegilops, Wheat and the Model Species Brachypodium and Rice as Revealed by COS Markers	PLOS ONE	Diploid Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. comosa and their natural allotetraploid hybrids Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata are important wild gene sources for wheat. With the aim of assisting in alien gene transfer, this study provides gene-based conserved orthologous set (COS) markers for the U and M genome chromosomes. Out of the 140 markers tested on a series of wheat-Aegilops chromosome introgression lines and flow-sorted subgenomic chromosome fractions, 100 were assigned to Aegilops chromosomes and six and seven duplications were identified in the U and M genomes, respectively. The marker-specific EST sequences were BLAST-ed to Brachypodium and rice genomic sequences to investigate macrosyntenic relationships between the U and M genomes of Aegilops, wheat and the model species. Five syntenic regions of Brachypodium identified genome rearrangements differentiating the U genome from the M genome and from the D genome of wheat. All of them seem to have evolved at the diploid level and to have been modified differentially in the polyploid species Ae. biuncialis and Ae. geniculata. A certain level of wheat-Aegilops homology was detected for group 1, 2, 3 and 5 chromosomes, while a clearly rearranged structure was showed for the group 4, 6 and 7 Aegilops chromosomes relative to wheat. The conserved orthologous set markers assigned to Aegilops chromosomes promise to accelerate gene introgression by facilitating the identification of alien chromatin. The syntenic relationships between the Aegilops species, wheat and model species will facilitate the targeted development of new markers specific for U and M genomic regions and will contribute to the understanding of molecular processes related to allopolyploidization.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0070844		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Molnar, Istvan; Vrana, Jan; Farkas, Andras; Kubalakova, Marie; Cseh, Andras; Molnar-Lang, Marta; Dolezel, Jaroslav	Flow sorting of C-genome chromosomes from wild relatives of wheat Aegilops markgrafii, Ae. triuncialis and Ae. cylindrica, and their molecular organization	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims Aegilops markgrafii (CC) and its natural hybrids Ae. triuncialis ((UUCCt)-U-t-C-t-C-t) and Ae. cylindrica ((DDCCc)-D-c-C-c-C-c) represent a rich reservoir of useful genes for improvement of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), but the limited information available on their genome structure and the shortage of molecular (cyto-) genetic tools hamper the utilization of the extant genetic diversity. This study provides the complete karyotypes in the three species obtained after fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA probes, and evaluates the potential of flow cytometric chromosome sorting. Methods The flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained chromosomes were characterized and the chromosome content of the peaks on the flow karyotypes was determined by FISH. Twenty-nine conserved orthologous set (COS) markers covering all seven wheat homoeologous chromosome groups were used for PCR with DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA. Key Results FISH with repetitive DNA probes revealed that chromosomes 4C, 5C, 7C(t), T6U(t)S.6U(t)L-5C(t)L, 1C(c) and 5D(c) could be sorted with purities ranging from 66 to 91 %, while the remaining chromosomes could be sorted in groups of 2-5. This identified a partial wheat-C-genome homology for group 4 and 5 chromosomes. In addition, 1C chromosomes were homologous with group 1 of wheat; a small segment from group 2 indicated 1C-2C rearrangement. An extensively rearranged structure of chromosome 7C relative to wheat was also detected. Conclusions The possibility of purifying Aegilops chromosomes provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the structure and evolution of the Aegilops C genome and to develop molecular tools to facilitate the identification of alien chromatin and support alien introgression breeding in bread wheat.	2015	10.1093/aob/mcv073		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Moraes, Ana P.; Chinaglia, Mariana; Palma-Silva, Clarisse; Pinheiro, Fabio	Interploidy hybridization in sympatric zones: the formation of Epidendrum fulgens x E. puniceoluteum hybrids (Epidendroideae, Orchidaceae)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Interspecific hybridization is a primary cause of extensive morphological and chromosomal variation and plays an important role in plant species diversification. However, the role of interploidal hybridization in the formation of hybrid swarms is less clear. Epidendrum encompasses wide variation in chromosome number and lacks strong premating barriers, making the genus a good model for clarifying the role of chromosomes in postzygotic barriers in interploidal hybrids. In this sense, hybrids from the interploidal sympatric zone between E. fulgens (2n=2x=24) and E. puniceoluteum (2n=4x=56) were analyzed using cytogenetic techniques to elucidate the formation and establishment of interploidal hybrids. Hybrids were not a uniform group: two chromosome numbers were observed, with the variation being a consequence of severe hybrid meiotic abnormalities and backcrossing with E. puniceoluteum. The hybrids were triploids (2n=3x=38 and 40) and despite the occurrence of enormous meiotic problems associated with triploidy, the hybrids were able to backcross, producing successful hybrid individuals with broad ecological distributions. In spite of the nonpolyploidization of the hybrid, its formation is a long-term evolutionary process rather than a product of a recent disturbance, and considering other sympatric zones in Epidendrum, these events could be recurrent.	2013	10.1002/ece3.752		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetic analysis of natural hybrids	FALSE			FALSE	
Moyle, LC; Graham, EB	Genome-wide associations between hybrid sterility QTL and marker transmission ratio distortion	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Marker transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in genetic mapping populations is frequently ascribed to selection against allelic combinations that cause hybrid incompatibility. Accordingly, genomic regions of TRD should be nonrandomly associated (colocated) with loci that underlie hybrid incompatibility. To directly test this hypothesis, we evaluated the genome-wide qualitative and quantitative agreement between chromosomal regions exhibiting marker TRD and those known to contain hybrid incompatibility quantitative trait locus (QTL). Incompatibility data came from a near-isogenic line (NIL) analysis of pollen and seed sterility in a cross between two Solanum (formerly Lycopersicon) species. We assessed (1) whether these incompatibility loci are colocated with markers that show significant TRD in two earlier generations preceding these introgression lines and (2) whether the magnitude of marker distortion quantitatively matches the estimated strength of selection against each incompatibility locus. We found evidence that TRD regions are chromosomally colocated with hybrid incompatibility loci more frequently than is expected by chance: pollen sterility QTLs were most closely associated with distorted heterozygote frequencies in later-generation backcrosses. Nonetheless, there was no evidence for an association between TRD and seed sterility and little evidence of a quantitative association between the magnitude of marker TRD and the fitness effects of heterospecific alleles at each chromosomal location. We propose and test a model (the "dance partner" model) to explain several cases where regions of TRD are not associated with hybrid incompatibility loci. Under this model, some NILs containing greater than one heterospecific introgression may not express hybrid incompatibility phenotypes because they carry both appropriate genetic dance partners required for a fully functional interaction. Accordingly, negative interactions expressed in earlier backcross generations are masked in these double-introgression NILs. Based on this model, we identify the location of several new putative pairwise interactors underlying hybrid incompatibility in this species cross.	2006	10.1093/molbev/msj112		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross/introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Development of beta-Carotene Rich Maize Hybrids through Marker-Assisted Introgression of beta-carotene hydroxylase Allele	PLOS ONE	Development of vitamin A-rich cereals can help in alleviating the widespread problem of vitamin A deficiency. We report here significant enhancement of kernel beta-carotene in elite maize genotypes through accelerated marker-assisted backcross breeding. A favourable allele (543 bp) of the beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1) gene was introgressed in the seven elite inbred parents, which were low (1.4 mu g/g) in kernel beta-carotene, by using a crtRB1-specific DNA marker for foreground selection. About 90% of the recurrent parent genome was recovered in the selected progenies within two backcross generations. Concentration of beta-carotene among the crtRB1-introgressed inbreds varied from 8.6 to 17.5 mu g/g - a maximum increase up to 12.6-fold over recurrent parent. The reconstituted hybrids developed from improved parental inbreds also showed enhanced kernel beta-carotene as high as 21.7 mu g/g, compared to 2.6 mu g/g in the original hybrid. The reconstituted hybrids evaluated at two locations possessed similar grain yield to that of original hybrids. These beta-carotene enriched high yielding hybrids can be effectively utilized in the maize biofortification programs across the globe.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0113583		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Genetic resources and breeding methodologies for improving drought tolerance in wheat	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT	Yield gains from rain-fed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, particularly in areas experiencing intermittent and terminal dry spells, can be realized through integrated breeding with promising genetic and genomic resources using appropriate methodologies. This enables targeted recombination of novel genes for drought tolerance and selection of desirable genotypes. Continuous exploration of new sources of genetic variation and introgression of suitable genes into elite drought-susceptible genotypes, including via transgenic approaches, and the use of genome editing could offer exciting future prospects in acquiring drought-tolerant wheat genotypes. This review highlights the available genetic resources, the major wheat genebanks and databases, as well as the breeding methodologies for drought tolerance in wheat, including prebreeding, conventional breeding, hybrid breeding, and genomics-assisted breeding. The potential of genetic modification through the transgenic and genomeediting approaches is also discussed. Emphasis is placed on how best these breeding methods can be brought together to develop strategies aimed at improving drought tolerance in wheat.	2017	10.1080/15427528.2017.1345816		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Nair, N. V.; Mohanraj, K.; Sunadaravelpandian, K.; Suganya, A.; Selvi, A.; Appunu, C.	Characterization of an intergeneric hybrid of Erianthus procerus x Saccharum officinarum and its backcross progenies	EUPHYTICA	Erianthus, a related genus grouped under 'Saccharum complex' is seriously considered as a potential genetic resource for imparting high biomass production, multi ratooning ability, resistance to major diseases and pests and tolerance to abiotic stresses to sugarcane varieties. However introgression of Erianthus had limited success in the past in view of the high genetic distance between the two genera and the consequent low compatibility of such crosses. The inherent difficulty in precisely identifying the true hybrids from the selfed progenies from such crosses also remains a difficult task. In this article we report the production of an intergeneric hybrid GU04(28) EO2 involving Erianthus and Saccharum. The hybrid was characterized using 5s rDNA markers and evaluated for agro-morphological traits. The chromosome number of the Erianthus procerus 9 Saccharum officinarum hybrid approximated to 2n + n transmission with elimination of few chromosomes. The hybrid showed relatively low stalk weight and thickness, but had high yield potential in view of the high stalk population. The hybrid also showed high drought tolerance and resistance to red rot disease. This hybrid was backcrossed to a commercial sugarcane variety Co 06027. Erianthus-specific 5s rDNA marker was present in five of the BC1 progenies, thus confirming their Erianthus derivation. The chromosome number of the BC1 progenies ranged from 2n = 88-94, consistent with n ? n transmission. The BC1 progenies showed significant improvement in stalk weight and juice sucrose over the F1 hybrid and it may be possible to develop varieties with commercial potential with few more backcrosses. The Erianthus 9 Saccharum hybrid GU04(28) EO2 is thus a potential source for diversifying the genetic base of the sugarcane varieties as it combines the genomes of two distantly related genera and also in view of its yield potential, red rot resistance and drought tolerance.	2017	10.1007/s10681-017-2053-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Nardi, Flavia Domizia; Dobes, Christoph; Mueller, Dorothee; Grasegger, Tobias; Myllynen, Tuuli; Alonso-Marcos, Henar; Tribsch, Andreas	Sexual intraspecific recombination but not de novo origin governs the genesis of new apomictic genotypes in Potentilla puberula (Rosaceae)	TAXON	Apomixis asexual reproduction via seeds might arise de novo following polyploidisation events, or via reproductive transfer of apomixis. Both processes can be obtained within species or via hybridisation. We aimed to determine the origin of apomictic genotypes in Potentilla puberula, a rosaceous species showing reproductive differentiation with ploidy: sexual tetraploids and apomictic penta- to octoploids, which regularly co-occur in sympatry. The study is based on 726 individuals, comprising all cytotypes, collected from 138 populations in the Eastern European Alps. We established relationships of cytotypes based on ATLP fingerprinting and cpDNA sequencing to test (1) whether the apomicts are of recurrent allopolyploid origin or originated from within the species via autopolyploidy, and (2) whether there are indications for reproductive transfer versus de novo origin of apomixis. Three principal pathways were identified which explain the origin of new apomictic genotypes, all involving at least one apomictic parent and thus compatible with the idea of reproductive transfer of the apomictic trait to the progeny: (1) self-fertilisation otTunreduced egg cells in apomicts; (2) cross-fertilisation among apomicts; and (3) occasionally, heteroploid crosses among sexuals and apomicts. Autopolyploids derived from tetraploid sexuals were repeatedly observed, but did not express apomixis. Finally, our results suggest no role of other species in the origin of extant apomictic genotypes of P. puberula, although local hybrids with P. crantzli were identified. In conclusion, our results show that the formation of new apomictic genotypes required a genetic contribution from at least one apomictic parent. This finding is in accordance with the idea that apomixis is inheritable in P. puberula. On the contrary, lack of apomixis in penta- and hexaploids derived from sexual backgrounds did not support the hypothesis of a de novo origin of apomixis. Relatively high frequency of remnant sexuality in the apomicts involving different cytological pathways of seed formation can explain their high cytological and genotypic diversity. Finally, lack of global introgression from a third taxon is in support of P. puberula as a concise, although highly diverse, species.	2018	10.12705/676.8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Navabi, Zahra K.; Stead, Kiersten E.; Pires, J. Chris; Xiong, Zhiyong; Sharpe, Andrew G.; Parkin, Isobel A. P.; Rahman, M. Habibur; Good, Allen G.	Analysis of B-Genome Chromosome Introgression in Interspecific Hybrids of Brassica napus x B. carinata	GENETICS	Brassica carinata, an allotetraploid with B and C genomes, has a number of traits that would be valuable to introgress into B. napus. Interspecific hybrids were created between B. carinata (BBCC) and B. napus (AACC), using an advanced backcross approach to identify and introgress traits of agronomic interest from the B. carinata genome and to study the genetic changes that occur during the introgression process. We mapped the B and C genomes of B. carinata with SSR markers and observed their introgression into B. napus through a number of backcross generations, focusing on a BC3 and BC3S1 sibling family. There was close colinearity between the C genomes of B. carinata and B. napus and we provide evidence that B. carinata C chromosomes pair and recombine normally with those of B. napus, suggesting that similar to other Brassica allotetraploids no major chromosomal rearrangements have taken place since the formation of B. carinata. There was no evidence of introgression of the B chromosomes into the A or C chromosomes of B. napus; instead they were inherited as whole linkage groups with the occasional loss of terminal segments and several of the B-genome chromosomes were retained across generations. Several BC3S1 families were analyzed using SSR markers, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) assays, and chromosome counts to study the inheritance of the B-genome chromosome(s) and their association with morphological traits. Our work provides an analysis of the behavior of chromosomes in an interspecific cross and reinforces the challenges of introgressing novel traits into crop plants.	2011	10.1534/genetics.110.124925		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Naz, Ali Ahmad; Dadshani, Said; Ballvora, Agim; Pillen, Klaus; Leon, Jens	Genetic Analysis and Transfer of Favorable Exotic QTL Alleles for Grain Yield Across D Genome Using Two Advanced Backcross Wheat Populations	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Hexaploid wheat evolved through a spontaneous hybridization of tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum, AABB) with diploid wild grass (Aegilops tauschii, DD). Recent genome sequencing found alarmingly low genetic diversity and abundance of repeated sequences across D genome as compared to AB genomes. This characteristic feature of D genome often results in a low recombination rate and abrupt changes in chromosome, which are the major hurdles to utilize the genetic potential of D genome in wheat breeding. In the present study, we evaluated two advanced backcross populations designated as B22 (250 BC2F3:6 lines) and Z86 (150 BC(2)F(3)(:6 )lines) to test their yield potential and to enrich the D genome diversity simultaneously. The populations B22 and Z86 were derived by crossing winter wheat cultivars Batis and Zentos with synthetic hexaploid wheat accessions Syn022L and Syn086L, respectively. These populations were genotyped using SNP markers and phenotyped for yield traits in ten environments in Germany. Marker analysis identified lower recombination rate across D genome as compared to A and B genomes in both populations. Further, we compared the genotype data with the trait grain yield to identify favorable exotic introgressions from synthetic wheat accessions. QTL analysis identified seven and 13 favorable exotic QTL alleles associated with enhancement or at least stable grain yield in populations B22 and Z86, respectively. These favorable introgressions were located on all chromosomes from 1D to 7D. The strongest exotic QTL allele on chromosome 1D at SNP marker RAC875_c51493_471 resulted in a relative increase of 8.6% in grain yield as compared to cultivated allele. The identified exotic introgressions will help to refine useful exotic chromosome segments for their incorporation for improving yield and increasing D genome diversity among cultivated varieties.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.00711		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Neelam, Kumari; Mahajan, Ritu; Gupta, Vikas; Bhatia, Dharminder; Gill, Baljeet Kaur; Komal, Ratika; Lore, Jagjeet Singh; Mangat, Gurjit Singh; Singh, Kuldeep	High-resolution genetic mapping of a novel bacterial blight resistance gene xa-45(t) identified from Oryza glaberrima and transferred to Oryza sativa	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Key message A novel recessive bacterial blight resistance locus designated as a xa-45(t) was identified from Oryza glaberrima accession IRGC 102600B, transferred to O. sativa and mapped to the long arm of chromosome 8 using ddRAD sequencing approach. The identified QTL spans 80 kb region on Nipponbare reference genome IRGSP-1.0 and contains 9 candidate genes. An STS marker developed from the locus LOC_Os08g42410 was found co-segregating with the trait and will be useful for marker-assisted transfer of this recessive resistance gene in breeding programs. Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, is one of the major constraints of rice productivity in Southeast Asia. In spite of having 44 bacterial blight resistance genes from cultivated rice and wild species, the durability of resistance is always at stake due to the continually evolving nature of the pathogen and lack of suitable chemical control. Here, we report high-resolution genetic mapping of a novel bacterial blight resistance gene tentatively designated as a xa-45(t) from an introgression line derived from Oryza glaberrima accession IRGC 102600B. This introgression line was crossed with the susceptible rice indica cultivar cv. Pusa 44 to generate F-2 and F-2:3 populations for inheritance and mapping studies. The inheritance studies revealed the presence of single recessive locus controlling resistance to the Xanthomonas pathotype seven. A high-density linkage map was constructed using double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing of 96 F-2 populations along with the parents. The QTL mapping identified a major locus on the long arm of rice chromosome 8 with a LOD score of 33.22 between the SNP markers C8.26737175 and C8.26818765. The peak marker, C8.26810477, explains 49.8% of the total phenotypic variance and was positioned at 202.90 cM on the linkage map. This major locus spans 80 kb region on Nipponbare reference genome IRGSP-1.0 and contains 9 candidate genes. A co-segregating STS marker was developed from the LOC_Os08g42410 for efficient transfer of this novel gene to elite cultivars.	2020	10.1007/s00122-019-03501-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Neelam, Kumari; Rawat, Nidhi; Tiwari, Vijay K.; Kumar, Sundip; Chhuneja, Parveen; Singh, Kuldeep; Randhawa, Gursharn S.; Dhaliwal, Harcharan S.	Introgression of group 4 and 7 chromosomes of Ae. peregrina in wheat enhances grain iron and zinc density	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Dietary deficiency of iron and zinc micronutrients affects more than two billion people worldwide. Breeding for micronutrient-dense crops is the most sustainable and cost-effective approach for alleviation of micronutrient malnutrition. Three accessions of Aegilops peregrina (Hack.) Maire & Weill (2n = 28, (UUSSP)-U-P-S-P-S-P), selected for high grain iron and zinc concentration were crossed with Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring (Ph (I) ). The sterile F-1 hybrids were backcrossed with elite wheat cultivars to get fertile BC2F2 derivatives. Some of the fertile BC2F2 derivatives showed nearly 100% increase in grain iron and more than 200% increase in grain zinc concentration compared to the recipient wheat cultivars. The development of derivatives with significantly higher grain micronutrients, high thousand-grain weight and harvest index suggests that the enhanced micronutrient concentration is due to the distinct genetic system of Ae. peregrina and not to the concentration effect. Genomic in situ hybridization, comparison of introgressed chromosomes with the standard karyotype of Ae. peregrina and simple sequence repeat marker analysis revealed the introgression of 7S(P) chromosomes in five selected derivatives, 7U(P) in four, group 4 and 4S(P) in three and a translocated 5U(P) of Ae. peregrina in one of the selected derivatives. Molecular marker analysis using the introgressed chromosome markers indicated that two of the BC2F3 progenies were stabilized as disomic addition lines. It could, therefore, be concluded that the group 4 and 7 chromosomes of Ae. peregrina carry the genes for high grain iron and zinc concentration.	2011	10.1007/s11032-010-9514-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Newaskar, Ganesh S.; Chimote, Vivek P.; Mehetre, Subhash S.; Jadhav, Ashok S.	Interspecific hybridization in Gossypium L.: characterization of progenies with different ploidy-confirmed multigenomic backgrounds	PLANT BREEDING	Cytological and molecular investigations were undertaken for parent and progeny derived from a trispecific line [2(Gossypium arboreum xG.anomalum)xG.hirsutum var. BWR], which was crossed with G.hirsutum var. JLH168. Cytomorphological analysis of the F1 (G.arboreumxG.anomalum), its amphidiploid and progeny from trispecies hybrid showed distorted ploidy segregation with monovalents to hexavalents and high intergenomic (small A2 and large B1) allosynthetic chromosome pairing. Microsatellite analysis identified three fragments associated with G.arboreum and G.anomalum and six fragments associated with G.hirsutum in derivates of the trispecies linexG.hirsutum var. JLH168. Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism (IRAP) analysis revealed fragments of G.arboreum and G.anomalum, only in F1 and amphidiploid. Chromosomal association and microsatellite analysis of three progeny genotypes (i.e. haploid, hexaploid and tetraploid no. 1) confirmed that they share multigenomic background from the three cotton species (A2, AhDh and B1 genome). The interspecific hybrid cotton genotypes studied are likely to be useful for the introgression of genes from diploid species to commercial upland cultivars.	2013	10.1111/pbr.12031		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Nobis, Marcin; Gudkova, Polina D.; Baiakhmetov, Evgenii; Zabicka, Justyna; Krawczyk, Katarzyna; Sawicki, Jakub	Hybridisation, introgression events and cryptic speciation in Stipa (Poaceae): A case study of the Stipa heptapotamica hybrid-complex	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS	Hybridisation, considered one of the major drivers of speciation in plants, commonly occurs among many genera of grasses, including the genus Stipa L. one of the largest in the family Poaceae in the Old World. In the course of research on Stipa, we studied S. richteriana, S. lessingiana, and their putative hybrid S. heptapotamica, all of which grow in south-eastern Kazakhstan. Stipa heptapotamica is treated as a local endemic, known only from the eastern part of the country. We used an integrative approach, combining morphological and molecular data, to validate the status of the hybrid taxon and present for the first time clear data documenting natural hybridisation in Stipa. The macro- and micromorphological analyses presented here show S. heptapotamica to be intermediate to its parental species in the characters studied; pollen analysis demonstrates low viability of pollen grains (below 50% compared to 94% and 87% in S. lessingiana and S. richteriana, respectively); molecular analyses based on inter simple sequence repeat markers (ISSR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data prove that S. heptapotamica originated strictly from hybridisation events involving S. richteriana and S. lessingiana. ISSR markers reveal possible introgression events between S. lessingiana and S. heptapotamica, whereas NGS data analyses confirm the maternal inheritance of a plastome from S. lessingiana in S. heptapotamica and support the finding of cryptic lineages within S. richteriana.	2019	10.1016/j.ppees.2019.05.001		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	*did not quantify introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Novoselskaya-Dragovich, A. Yu.; Yankovskaya, A. A.; Badaeva, E. D.	Alien introgressions and chromosomal rearrangements do not affect the activity of gliadin-coding genes in hybrid lines of Triticum aestivum L. x Aegilops columnaris Zhuk	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII	Using chromosome C-banding and electrophoresis of grain storage proteins, gliadins, 17 Triticum aestivum-Aegilops columnaris lines with substitutions of chromosomes of homoeologous groups 1 and 6 were examined. Based on their high polymorphism, gliadins were used to identify alien genetic material. For all of the lines examined, electrophoretic analysis of gliadin spectra confirmed substitution of wheat chromosomes 6A, 6D or 1D for the homoeologous Aegilops chromosomes of genomes U-c or X-c. The substitution manifested in the disappearance of the products of gliadin-coding genes on chromosomes 6A, 6D or 1D with the simultaneous appearance of the products of genes localized on alien chromosomes of genomes U-c or X-c. Thus, Aegilops chromosomes were shown to be functionally active in the alien wheat genome. The absence of alien genes expression in the lines carrying a long arm deletion in chromosome 6X(C) suggested that the gliadin-coding locus moved from the short chromosome arm (its characteristic position in all known wheat species) to the long one. This is probably associated with a large species-specific pericentric inversion. In spite of losing a part of its long arm and combination with a non-homologous chromosome of a different genome (4BL), chromosome 1D was fully functioning. For Aegilops, the block type of gliadin components inheritance was shown, indicating similarity in the structural organization of gliadin-coding loci in these genera. Based on determining genetic control of various polypeptides in the electrophoretic aegilops spectrum, markers to identify Ae. columnaris chromosomes 1X(C), 6X(c)and 6U(C) were constructed.	2018	10.18699/VJ18.388		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Numaguchi, Koji; Ishio, Shogo; Kitamura, Yuto; Nakamura, Kentaro; Ishikawa, Ryo; Ishii, Takashige	Microsatellite Marker Development and Population Structure Analysis in Japanese Apricot (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc.)	HORTICULTURE JOURNAL	Japanese apricot (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc.) is one of the major fruit tree crops in Japan. However, a paucity of molecular tools has limited studies on the species' genetic diversity and clone identification. Therefore, we newly designed 201 microsatellite markers using the P.mume reference genome and selected 20 highly polymorphic markers. The markers showed higher polymorphism detectability than those previously developed using peach and apricot genomes. They were used successfully for fingerprinting most of the Prunus cultivars examined (124 P.mume accessions and one accession each of P.armeniaca, P.salicina, P.persica, and P.dulcis), and the resulting genotype data were used to examine the genetic differentiation of six Japanese apricot cultivar groups, including those producing normal fruit, small-fruit, and ornamental flowers, as well as Taiwanese cultivars, putative hybrids of P.armeniaca and P.mume, and putative hybrids of P.salicina and P. mume. Phylogenetic cluster analysis showed three clades with high support values; one Glade comprised the putative P.armeniaca x P.mume hybrids, and the two others included Taiwanese and ornamental cultivars. The rest of the accessions were grouped into two wide clusters, but not clearly divided into the respective cultivar groups. These complex relationships were supported by the principal coordinate and STRUCTURE analyses. Since Japanese apricot is thought to have originated in China, many factors such as human preference, geographical separation, introgression, and local breeding, may have been involved to form the present complex genetic structure in Japanese apricot.	2019	10.2503/hortj.UTD-013		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker development	FALSE			FALSE	
Obukhova, L. V.; Laikova, L. I.; Shumny, V. K.	Analysis of storage proteins (prolamines, puroindolines and Waxy) in common wheat lines Triticum aestivum L. x (Triticum timopheevii Zhuk. x Triticum tauschii) with complex resistance to fungal infections	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Storage proteins (prolamines, puroindolines, and Waxy) were studied in common wheat introgression lines obtained with the use of the Saratovskaya 29 (S29) cultivar line and synthetic hexaploid wheat (Triticum timopheevii Zhuk. x T. tauschii) (Sintetik, Sin.) displaying complex resistance to fungal infections. Comparative analysis of storage proteins in the introgression lines of common wheat Triticum aestivum L. and in the parental forms revealed the only line (BC5) having a substitution at the Gli-B2 locus from Sintetik. Hybrid lines subjected to nine backcrosses with the recurrent parental form S29 and selections for resistance to pathogens can be considered as nearly isogenic for the selected trait and retaining the allelic composition of (1) prolamines responsible for the bread-making qualitiy, (2) puroindolines associated with grain texture, and (3) Waxy proteins responsible for nutritive qualities. These lines are valuable as donors of immunity in breeding programs without the loss of the quality of flour and grain as compared to the S29 line and are also important in searching for genes determining resistance to leaf and stem rust and to powdery mildew. The amphiploid has a number of characters (silent Glu-A1 locus and Ha genotype) that can negatively affect the quality of flour and grain and thus should be taken into account when choosing this donor.	2010	10.1134/S1022795410060062		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Ogugo, Veronica; Semagn, Kassa; Beyene, Yoseph; Runo, Steven; Olsen, Michael; Warburton, Marilyn L.	Parental genome contribution in maize DH lines derived from six backcross populations using genotyping by sequencing	EUPHYTICA	Molecular characterization of doubled haploid (DH) maize lines and estimation of parental genome contribution (PGC) may be useful for choosing pairs of DH lines for hybrid make up and new pedigree starts. Six BC1-derived DH populations created by crossing two donor with three recurrent parents were genotyped with 97,190 polymorphic markers with the objectives of: (i) understanding genetic purity, genetic distance and relationship among 417 maize DH lines; (ii) estimating PGC of the DH lines derived from different genetic backgrounds; and (iii) understanding the correlation between donor parent introgression and testcross performance for grain yield and anthesis-silking interval (ASI) under managed drought and optimum environments. The DH lines were 97 % genetically pure, with < 2 % heterogeneity; only two DH lines showed heterogeneity > 5 %, which is likely to be due to errors during seed multiplication or maintenance. Genetic distance between pairwise comparisons of the 417 DH lines ranged from 0.055 to 0.457; only 0.01 % showed a genetic distance < 0.100, indicating large genetic differences among the DH lines. Both populations 1 and 6 showed significantly lower (p < 0.001) donor introgression than the other four populations. Donor parent contribution was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the CML444 genetic background than CML395 and CML488. The average donor and recurrent PGC across all 417 DH lines was 31.7 and 64.3 %, respectively. Donor genome introgression was higher than expected in 82 % of the DH lines in the BC1 generation, possibly due to artificial selection during the DH process, during the development of F-1 or BC1 seed, or during initial agronomic evaluation of the DH lines. Donor parent introgression up to 32 % showed significant positive correlation with grain yield under drought (r = 0.312, p < 0.001) and optimum (r = 0.142, p < 0.050) environments but negative correlation with ASI under drought (r = -0.276, p < 0.001). Additional multi-environment phenotype data under managed drought are needed to confirm the correlations reported in this study and to map the specific genomic regions associated with such correlations.	2015	10.1007/s10681-014-1238-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ohnishi, Takayuki; Yoshino, Mihoko; Toriyama, Kinya; Kinoshita, Tetsu	Rapid establishment of introgression lines using cytoplasmic male sterility and a restorer gene in Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses have greatly enhanced our understanding of complex traits in rice (Oryza sativa). In parallel, the development of introgression lines has provided a powerful tool for elucidation of complicated genetic networks and identification of QTL. We recently developed a biotron breeding system that allows rapid indoor cultivation of rice plants. The system, however, has two relatively weak points in its application to marker-assisted breeding in rice: first, variation in generation times among cultivars; second, the low number of seeds produced by crosses. To compensate for these weaknesses, we propose utilizing cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and restorer (Rf) lines with a cv. Nipponbare genetic background. Through use of the Nipponbare genetic background, rice generation times of 2 months can be achieved regardless of any differences in the genetic background of the donor rice plant. This CMS-Rf system confers a high yield of hybrid seeds, avoids the need for emasculation and precludes accidental crosses. Our results demonstrate that this new methodology can markedly accelerate many different aspects of rice research, especially in functional genomics. The combination of biotron breeding system, early flowering habit and CMS will be of great value for screening candidate genes associated with QTL and for introducing useful QTL into elite cultivars.	2013	10.1007/s11032-013-9910-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Introgression of Aegilops genetic material into the genome of hexaploid triticale	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Cytological analysis of different meiosis stages was performed in F-4 hybrids in comparison with the F-1 hybrids obtained through crosses between the hexaploid triticale and genome-substitution forms of Aurolata (AABBUU) and Aurosis (AABBS(sh)S(sh)) wheat, in which D genome of common wheat Aurora was substituted for the genomes of Aegilops umbellulata and Ae. sharonensis, respectively. It was demonstrated that in F-4 the level of bivalent conjugation was substantially higher than the expected one. However, the value of meiotic index in F-4 hybrids was still small, pointing to incomplete process of the meiosis stabilization, specifically, of the stages following the metaphase I. Based on the data of morphological and biochemical analyses of the hybrids produced, the forms of triticale carrying some properties of the genus Aegilops, which were of interest for genetic and breeding studies, were isolated.	2007	10.1134/S102279540703009X		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Cytomorphological analysis of a novel hybrid from Solanum melongena 'Golden' x S. scabrum 'Scabrum' (Solanaceae)	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH	Genotype manipulation through the introduction of novel genes for improved yield, agronomic qualities and a larger gene pool informed an experimental cross between diploid Solanum melongena 'Golden' (2n = 2x = 24) and tetraploid S. scabrum 'Scabrum' (2n = 4x = 48). The F-1 fruit contained eight seeds which had a 100% germination and a chromosome number 2n = 6x = 72. Surviving hybrids were closer to the diploid parent in many characters. Leaves were fairly lobed, sparsely hairy and were 13.5 x 8.6 cm in the hybrid compared to the hairy, deeply lobed, 14.8 x 10.6 cm leaves in the diploid and glabrous, entire and 11.4 x 10.6 cm leaves in the tetraploid parent. The inflorescence in the hybrid was a raceme as in the diploid parent but was umbellate in the tetraploid. Pollen viability was 38.2% in the hybrid but was 71% and 97.4% in the diploid and tetraploid parents, respectively. Fruit was seedless in the F-2; it was round and red, containing 384 seeds, globose-shaped, yellow seeds in the diploid, and 67, round, purple seeds in the tetraploid parent. Meiosis was regular in the hybrid with few univalents and impaired bivalents due to dissimilar parental genomes. Mitotic chromosomes were asymmetrical with various sizes. Epistasis and negative gene interaction mechanisms were implicated in the hybrids' low quality and breakdown. Backcross to the tetraploid parent may bring about gene recombination and allelic realignment for desirable phenotypes in the F-2 and subsequent generations. Endoduplication of the triploid zygote might have produced an autoallohexaploid hybrid.	2009			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Pace, Brian A.; Alexander, Helen M.; Emry, Jason D.; Mercer, Kristin L.	Seed fates in crop-wild hybrid sunflower: crop allele and maternal effects	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS	Domestication has resulted in selection upon seed traits found in wild populations, yet crop-wild hybrids retain some aspects of both parental phenotypes. Seed fates of germination, dormancy, and mortality can influence the success of crop allele introgression in crop-wild hybrid zones, especially if crop alleles or crop-imparted seed coverings result in out-of-season germination. We performed a seed burial experiment using crop, wild, and diverse hybrid sunflower (Helianthus annuus) cross types to test how a cross type's maternal parent and nuclear genetic composition might affect its fate under field conditions. We observed higher maladaptive fall germination in the crop- and F-1- produced seeds than wild-produced seeds and, due to an interaction with percent crop alleles, fall germination was higher for cross types with more crop-like nuclear genetics. By spring, crop-produced cross types had the highest overwintering mortality, primarily due to higher fall germination. Early spring germination was identical across maternal types, but germination continued for F-1-produced seeds. In conclusion, the more wild-like the maternal parent or the less proportion of the cross type's genome contributed by the crop, the greater likelihood a seed will remain ungerminated than die. Wild-like dormancy may facilitate introgression through future recruitment from the soil seed bank.	2015	10.1111/eva.12236		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Panahandeh, J.; Valizadeh, A.; Khosroshahly, A.; Yennishin, A. P.; Khoei, F. R.; Mahna, N.	Microsporogenesis and crossing behavior of a tetraploid, interspecific inter-EBN hybrid potato	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	The commercial potato Solanum tuberosum L. autotetraploid, has many wild relatives with the ploidy range of 2-6x, which are suitable sources of traits interesting in potato breeding. However, not all of these species can be readily crossed with cultivated potato due to pre- and post-zygotic barriers. Post-zygotic barrier on Solanum spp. is attributed to their difference in endosperm balance number (EBN). According to the EBN successful crosses need to have a 2:1 ratio of maternal to paternal EBN in hybrid endosperm. Thus, only parents with the same EBN can be crossed. The cultivated potato is 4EBN, while wild allotetraploid relatives such as S. stoloniferum are 2EBN. In this study, meiosis and crossability of an exceptional tetraploid 3EBN hybrid obtained from our previous research by crossing S. stoloniferum x S. tuberosum with 2 and 4EBN testers were studied. Although the exact chromosome pairing analysis was not possible, the formation of several polyvalents in each meiocyte suggests that recombination could occur between different genomes. Meiosis had many irregularities such as unequal segregation as well as having laggard chromosome and micronuclei. Crosses involving the interspecific hybrid, as the male parent with 2 and 4EBN testers were not successful, some of which were apparently due to the pollen-pistil incompatibility. Interestingly controlled self-pollination resulted in viable seeds. Crosses of the interspecific hybrid as pistillate parent in the absence of pre-zygotic barrier in most case were successful. Results of the study confirmed the segregation of EBN value in the gametes of hybrid. It was expected that backcross progeny of this hybrid would be a good source for selecting aneutetraploids.

Pasakinskiene, I; Jones, N	A decade of "chromosome painting" in Lolium and Festuca	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	GISH has been a particularly useful technique for studying the Lolium-Festuca species complex of forage grasses. The reason for this utility is two-fold: ( i) the complex is unique amongst crop plants in which fertile hybrids, and backcross progenies, can be produced which recombine genomes and promiscuously exchange their genes through homoeologous recombination; ( ii) dispersed repetitive DNAs differ between species, and this allows tracking of the identity of chromosomes and chromosome segments. This tracking property has enabled several fruitful lines of research to produce a harvest of new information for both fundamental and practical purposes. We review this first decade of GISH ( genomic in situ hybridization) in Lolium-Festuca, and discuss and summarize the achievements which have accrued. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

Pea, Giorgio; Aung, Htay Htay; Frascaroli, Elisabetta; Landi, Pierangelo; Pe, Mario Enrico	Extensive genomic characterization of a set of near-isogenic lines for heterotic QTL in maize (Zea mays L.)	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Despite the crucial role that heterosis has played in crop improvement, its genetic and molecular bases are still elusive. Several types of structured populations were used to discover the genetic architecture underlying complex phenotypes, and several QTL related to heterosis were detected. However, such analyses generally lacked the statistical power required for the detailed characterization of individual QTL. Currently, QTL introgression into near-isogenic materials is considered the most effective strategy to this end, despite such materials inevitably contain a variable, unknown and undesired proportion of non-isogenic genome. An introgression program based on residual heterozygous lines allowed us to develop five pairs of maize (Zea mays L.) near-isogenic lines (NILs) suitable for the fine characterization of three major heterotic QTL previously detected. Here we describe the results of the detailed genomic characterization of these NILs that we undertook to establish their genotypic structure, to verify the presence of the expected genotypes within target QTL regions, and to determine the extent and location of residual non-isogenic genomic regions. Results: The SNP genotyping approach allowed us to determine the parent-of-origin allele for 14,937 polymorphic SNPs and to describe in detail the genotypic structure of all NILs. The correct introgression was confirmed for all target QTL in the respective NIL and several non-isogenic regions were detected genome-wide. Possible linkage drag effects associated to the specific introgressed regions were observed. The extent and position of other non-isogenic regions varied among NIL pairs, probably deriving from random segregating sections still present at the separation of lineages within pairs. Conclusions: The results of this work strongly suggest that the actual isogenicity and the genotypic architecture of near-isogenic materials should be monitored both during the introgression procedure and on the final materials as a paramount requisite for a successful mendelization of target QTL. The information here gathered on the genotypic structure of NILs will be integrated in future experimental programs aimed at the fine mapping and isolation of major heterotic QTL, a crucial step towards the understanding of the molecular bases of heterosis in maize.	2013	10.1186/1471-2164-14-61		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Perez-Jones, A.; Mallory-Smith, C. A.; Riera-Lizarazu, O.; Watson, C. J. W.; Wang, Z.; Rehman, M.; Zemetra, R. S.	Introgression of a strawbreaker foot rot resistance gene from winter wheat into jointed goatgrass	CROP SCIENCE	Strawbreaker foot rot (SFR) [Pseudocereosporella herpotrichoides (Fron) Deighton] is a disease of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in many wheat growing regions in the world. Resistance to SFR can be conferred by a single dominant gene (Pch1) from Aegilops ventricosa Tausch that was transferred onto chromosome 7D of wheat. 'Madsen', a hexaploid winter bread wheat, carries Pch1 and is highly resistant to SFR. Jointed goatgrass (Ae. cylindrica Host.) is a winter annual grass weed. Wheat and jointed goatgrass have the D genome in common and have been found to hybridize and backcross under field conditions. Since SFR resistance in winter wheat is controlled by Pch1 on the D genome, it is theoretically possible for resistance to be transferred to jointed goatgrass via backcrossing. A SFR resistant jointed goatgrass population would potentially have an ecological advantage in the presence of the disease. To evaluate the likelihood of gene introgression, Madsen, 'Stephens' (a SFR susceptible winter wheat), three jointed goatgrass accessions, and 15 artificially produced backcross progenies (BC2S2) were inoculated with SFR. The percentage of infection in Stephens, the joined goatgrass accessions, and the backcross progenies was 80% or greater except for one BC2S2 progeny that had only 20% infection. Madsen had 0% infection. The presence of Pch1 in the BC2S2 progeny was confirmed using a biochemical marker linked to the resistance gene. These results show that a SFR resistance gene from winter wheat can be transferred to jointed goatgrass.	2006	10.2135/cropsci2006.02.0077		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgrssion lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Perez-Jones, Alejandro; Mallory-Smith, Carol A.; Hansen, Jennifer L.; Zemetra, Robert S.	Introgression of an imidazolinone-resistance gene from winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) into jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is being commercialized in the USA. This technology allows wheat growers to selectively control jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host), a weed that is especially problematic because of its close genetic relationship with wheat. However, the potential movement of the imidazolinone-resistance gene from winter wheat to jointed goatgrass is a concern. Winter wheat and jointed goatgrass have the D genome in common and can hybridize and backcross under natural field conditions. Since the imidazolinone-resistance gene (Imi1) is located on the D genome, it is possible for resistance to be transferred to jointed goatgrass via hybridization and backcrossing. To study the potential for gene movement, BC2S2 plants were produced artificially using imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat (cv. FS-4) as the female parent and a native jointed goatgrass collection as the male recurrent parent. FS-4, the jointed goatgrass collection, and 18 randomly selected BC2S2 populations were treated with imazamox. The percentage of survival was 100% for the FS-4, 0% for the jointed goatgrass collection and 6 BC2S2 populations, 40% or less for 2 BC2S2 populations, and 50% or greater for the remaining 10 BC2S2 populations. Chromosome counts in BC2S3 plants showed a restoration of the chromosome number of jointed goatgrass, with four out of four plants examined having 28 chromosomes. Sequencing of AHASL1D in BC2S3 plants derived from BC2S2-6 revealed the sexual transmission of Imi1 from FS-4 to jointed goatgrass. Imi1 conferred resistance to the imidazolinone herbicide imazamox, as shown by the in vitro assay for acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) activity.	2006	10.1007/s00122-006-0421-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgrssion lines	FALSE			FALSE

Hybridization in a Commercial Production Field between Imidazolinone-Resistant Winter Wheat and Jointed Goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) Results in Pollen-Mediated Gene Flow of Imi1	WEED SCIENCE	Imidazolmone-resistant (IR) winter wheat allows selective control of jointed goatgrass with the herbicide imazamox. However, the spontaneous hybridization between jointed goatgrass and IR winter wheat threatens the value of the IR technology The objectives of this study were to determine if F, hybrids collected in a commercial production field under IR winter wheat fallow rotation in Oregon and their first-backcross progeny (BC!) carried the Inn] gene and were resistant to imazamox, and to analyze the parentage of F-1 and BC1 plants. The average seed set of the F-1 spikes was 3.3%, and the average germination of BC1 seed was 52%. All F-1 and BC1 plants tested carried Imi1. Jointed goatgrass plant mortality was 100% when treated with imazamox at 0 053 kg at ha(-1), compared to 0% for IR winter wheat and BC1 progeny. All F-1 plants had jointed goatgrass as the maternal parent; whereas, most BC1 plants (85.7%) were produced with IR winter wheat as the paternal backcross parent. Although the backcrossing of F-1 hybrids with jointed goatgrass is very low, it demonstrates the potential for introgression of Imi1 from IR winter wheat into jointed goatgrass under natural field conditions.	2010	10.1614/WS-D-10-00027.1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Generally, introgressed alien chromosomes show reduced meiotic pairing relative to the host genome, and may be eliminated over generations. Reduced pairing appears to result from a failure of some telomeres of alien chromosomes to incorporate into the leptotene bouquet at the onset of meiosis, thereby preventing chiasmate pairing. In this study, we analysed somatic nuclei of rye introgressions in wheat using 3D-FISH and found that while introgressed rye chromosomes or chromosome arms occupied discrete positions in the Rabl's orientation similar to chromosomes of the wheat host, their telomeres frequently occupied positions away from the nuclear periphery. The frequencies of such abnormal telomere positioning were similar to the frequencies of out-of-bouquet telomere positioning at leptotene, and of pairing failure at metaphase I. This study indicates that improper positioning of alien chromosomes that leads to reduced pairing is not a strictly meiotic event but rather a consequence of a more systemic problem. Improper positioning in the nuclei probably impacts the ability of introgressed chromosomes to migrate into the telomere bouquet at the onset of meiosis, preventing synapsis and chiasma establishment, and leading to their gradual elimination over generations.	2019	10.3390/ijms20061448		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Pershina, L. A.; Trubacheeva, N. V.; Sinyavskaya, M. G.; Devyatkina, E. P.; Kravtsova, L. A.	Nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility and the state of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA regions in alloplasmic recombinant and introgressive lines (H-vulgare)-T-aestivum	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Alloplasmic lines combining alien nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes are convenient models for studying the mechanisms of nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility/incompatibility. In the present study, we have investigated the correlation between the characters and state of mitochondrial (mt) and chloroplast (cp) DNA regions in alloplasmic recombinant common wheat lines with barley cytoplasm characterized by partial or total fertility. Fertility restoration in the studied lines (Hordeum vulgare)-Triticum aestivum is determined by different ratios of the genetic material of common wheat variety Pyrotrix 28, which is a fertility restorer in the cytoplasm of barley, and variety Saratovskaya 29, which is a fixer of sterility. In partially fertile lines with nuclear genomes dominated by the genetic material of Saratovskaya 29, plant growth and development are suppressed. In these lines we have identified the barley homoplasmy of cpDNA regions infA and rpoB and the heteroplasmy of the 18S/5S mt repeat and the cpDNA ycf5 region. Nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility in lines with reduced fertility (the genetic material of Pyrotrix 28 predominates in their nuclear genomes) is associated with restoration of normal plant growth and development and the changes in the state of the studied cpDNA and mtDNA regions towards the wheat type. Thus, in fertile lines, the cpDNA regions (infA, rpoB) and the 18S/5S mt repeat were identified in the homoplasmic wheat state; though the cpDNA ycf5 region was in the heteroplasmic state, it was dominated by the wheat type of the copies. The nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility is not broken as a result of introgression of the alien genetic material into the nuclear genome of one of the fertile lines; the plants of introgressive lines are fertile and normally developed, and the states of the cpDNA and mtDNA regions correspond to their states in fertile recombinant lines.	2014	10.1134/S102279541410010X		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Pinheiro, Fabio; de Melo E Gouveia, Tiago Manuel Zanfra; Cozzolino, Salvatore; Cafasso, Donata; Cardoso-Gustavson, Poliana; Suzuki, Rogerio Mamoru; Palma-Silva, Clarisse	Strong but permeable barriers to gene exchange between sister species of Epidendrum	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The investigation of reproductive barriers between sister species can provide insights into how new lineages arise, and how species integrity is maintained in the face of interspecific gene flow. Different pre- and postzygotic barriers can limit interspecific gene exchange in sympatric populations, and different sources of evidence are often required to investigate the role of multiple reproductive isolation (RI) mechanisms. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis of hybridization and potential introgression between Epidendrum secundum and Epidendrum xanthinum, two Neotropical food-deceptive orchid species, using nuclear and plastid microsatellites, experimental crosses, pollen tube growth observations, and genome size estimates. KEY RESULTS: A large number of hybrids between E. secundum and E. xanthinum were detected, suggesting weak premating barriers. The low fertility of hybrid plants and the absence of haplotype sharing between parental species indicated strong postmating barriers, reducing interspecific gene exchange and the development of advanced generation hybrids. Despite the strength of reproductive barriers, fertile seeds were produced in some backcrossing experiments, and the existence of interspecific gene exchange could not be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Strong but permeable barriers were found between E. secundum and E. xanthinum. Indeed, haplotype sharing was not detected between parental species, suggesting that introgression is limited by a combination of genic incompatibilities, including negative cytonuclear interactions. Most taxonomic uncertainties in this group were potentially influenced by incomplete RI barriers between species, which mainly occurred sympatrically.	2016	10.3732/ajb.1600064		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	do not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Pino-Nunes, L. E.; Figueira, A. V. de O.; Tulmann Neto, A.; Zsoegoen, A.; Piotto, F. A.; Silva, J. A.; Bernardi, W. F.; Peres, L. E. P.	Induced Mutagenesis and Natural Genetic Variation in Tomato 'Micro-Tom'	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TOMATO IN THE TROPICS	Tomato is a good example of a successful use of mutations affecting major genes for plant breeding, which are also valuable for gene discovery and physiological studies. However, mutant alleles are only currently known for an insignificant fraction of the about 35,000 genes in the tomato genome. Large scale mutagenesis and introgression of natural genetic variation from the wild ycopersicon species into a genetic model system, such as 'Micro-Tom' (MT), can be useful to fill this gap. MT has the advantages of little space requirements and rapid cycle. Here we present the use of MT to explore natural genetic variation in tomato as well as a reassessment of the methodology for large scale tomato mutagenesis based on different agents (chemical and physical) and targets (seeds and pollen). The best parameter for dose adjustment of mutagen was the fertility of M1 plants, whereas the germination of treated-seed and that of pollen were found to be poor indicators of mutagenic efficiency. Using seeds treated with 0.7% EMS and pollen treated with 80 Gy gamma-ray it was possible to isolate a large number of mutants, including some dominant non-chimeric ones in the M1 generation derived from mutagenized pollen. Some mutations were allelic to previously known ones, but many others are novel and could be use for tomato breeding (e.g. high Brix) and basic studies. Furthermore, natural genetic variation affecting diverse developmental process and metabolic pathways was introgressed into MT from wild species. MT was a suitable model for a fast an inexpensive screening and characterization of advantageous mutations and natural genetic variation, which could be further transferred to elite cultivars or hybrids.	2009			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line/crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Piperidis, N.; Aitken, K.; Hermann, S.	Towards a reliable method to select potentially high value Erianthus hybrids	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL	A key component of the sugarcane breeding program is introgression of new characteristics from wild species. Erianthus, a closely related genus to sugarcane, is a good candidate as it contains a number of traits of agronomic importance including pest and disease resistance and tolerance to drought and water-logging conditions. Fertile hybrids from intergeneric crosses between Saccharum officinarum and E. arundinaceus have been produced and studied. The chromosome composition of these hybrids was examined through the back-crossed generations and this revealed a loss of Erianthus chromosomes as well as recombinant chromosomes from both genera. There is potential that these recombinant chromosomes could be important in breeding if they are inherited stably during crossing. Good progress has also been made in developing a fast reliable method for identification of individual Erianthus chromosomes in the backcross hybrids. If important traits can be linked to Erianthus chromosomes then this method could become a valuable tool for sugarcane breeders as an effective selection screening method.	2013			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Poggio, L; Gonzalez, G; Confalonieri, V; Comas, C; Naranjo, CA	The genome organization and diversification of maize and its allied species revisited: evidences from classical and FISH-GISH cytogenetic analysis	CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH	The present review summarizes our classical and molecular cytogenetic investigations in the genus Zea. The results obtained from the meiotic behavior analysis of Zea species and hybrids, confirm the amphiploid nature of all species in the genus, with a basic number of x = 5 chromosomes. All species with 2n = 20 are diploidized allotetraploids, whereas Z. perennis ( 2n = 40) is an allooctoploid with four genomes somewhat divergent from one another. These analyses also revealed the existence of postzygotic reproductive isolation among Zea species. Our studies using genomic in situ hybridization GISH) provide evidence about the evolutionary relationships among maize and its allied species, and reveal remarkable genomic divergences. Particularly, knob sequences were not completely shared between taxa previously considered to be closely related. Our data strongly suggest that the teosinte Z. mays parviglumis is not the only progenitor of cultivated maize. Introgression of Tripsacum into cultivated maize cannot be discarded.

Posada, H.; Ferrand, M.; Davrieux, F.; Lashermes, P.; Bertrand, B.	Stability across environments of the coffee variety near infrared spectral signature	HEREDITY	Previous study on food plants has shown that near infrared (NIR) spectral methods seem effective for authenticating coffee varieties. We confirm that result, but also show that inter-variety differences are not stable from one harvest to the next. We put forward the hypothesis that the spectral signature is affected by environmental factors. The purpose of this study was to find a way of reducing this environmental variance to increase the method's reliability and to enable practical application in breeding. Spectral collections were obtained from ground green coffee samples from multi-location trials. Two harvests of bean samples from 11 homozygous introgressed lines, and the cv 'Caturra' as the control, supplied from three different sites, were compared. For each site, squared Euclidean distances among the 12 varieties were estimated from the NIR spectra. Matrix correlation coefficients were assessed by the Mantel test. We obtained very good stability (high correlations) for intervariety differences across the sites when using the two harvests data. If only the most heritable zones of the spectrum were used, there was a marked improvement in the efficiency of the method. This improvement was achieved by treating the spectrum as succession of phenotypic variables, each resulting from an environmental and genetic effect. Heritabilities were calculated with confidence intervals. A near infrared spectroscopy signature, acquired over a set of harvests, can therefore effectively characterize a coffee variety. We indicated how this typical signature can be used in breeding to assist in selection.	2009	10.1038/hdy.2008.88		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted introgression of resistance to fusarium wilt race 2 in Pusa 256, an elite cultivar of desi chickpea	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS	Fusarium wilt caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. ciceris causes extensive damage to chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in many parts of the world. In the central part of India, pathogen race 2 (Foc 2) causes severe yield losses. We initiated molecular marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) using desi cultivar, Vijay, as a donor to introgress resistance to this race (Foc2) in Pusa 256, another elite desi cultivar of chickpea. To confirm introgression of resistance for this race, foreground selection was undertaken using two SSR markers (TA 37 and TA110), with background selection to observe the recovery of recurrent parent genome using 45 SSRs accommodated in 8 multiplexes. F-1 plants were confirmed with molecular markers and backcrossed with Pusa 256, followed by cycles of foreground and background selection at each stage to generate 161 plants in BC3F2 during the period 2009-2013. Similarly, 46 BC3F1 plants were also generated in another set during the same period. On the basis of foreground selection, 46 plants were found homozygotes in BC3F2. Among them, 17 plants recorded > 91% background recovery with the highest recovery percentage of 96%. In BC3F1 also, 14 hybrid plants recorded a background recovery of > 85% with the highest background recovery percentage of > 94%. The identified plants were selfed to obtain 1341 BC3F3 and 2198 BC3F2 seeds which were screened phenotypically for resistance to fusarium wilt (race 2) besides doing marker analysis. Finally, 17 BC3F4 and 11 BC3F3 lines were obtained which led to identification of 5 highly resistant lines of Pusa 256 with Foc 2 gene introgressed in them. Development of these lines will help in horizontal as well as vertical expansion of chickpea in central part of India.	2017	10.1007/s00438-017-1343-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Androgenic Diploids of Erianthus arundinaceus with Paternal Chloroplast and Mitochondrial Genomes in Backcross Progeny of Saccharum x Erianthus Intergeneric Hybrids	TROPICAL PLANT BIOLOGY	Erianthus arundinaceus (Retz.) Jesweit is a tropical wild grass used in sugarcane (Saccharum L.) breeding for introgression of disease resistance and high cane yield traits. In the backcross (BC2) hybrids of Saccharum officinarumxE. arundinaceus and S. spontaneumxE. arundinaceus, with E. arundinaceus as pollen parent, the progeny had plants morphologically resembling E. arundinaceus. These plants were with chromosome number 2n=60, same as that of E. arundinaceus. Through genomic in situ hybridization it was found that all the chromosomes were of E. arundinaceus. PCR-RFLP studies of the chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA polymorphism revealed that these plants had Erianthus type cytoplasmic genomes rather than the expected maternal Saccharum type. Target region amplification polymorphism of molecular markers, comparison of morphological characters and pollen size deviation studies confirmed the possible origin of E. arundinaceus type progeny. The diploid pollen from E. arundinaceus plants is considered to be resulted in the diploid androgenesis or paternal apomixis. The diploid androgenesis with paternal transmission of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes along with the nuclear genome of E. arundinaceus in backcross progeny of SaccharumxErianthus intergeneric hybrids is the first report in angiosperms.	2019	10.1007/s12042-018-9214-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Raffee	Genome Characterization of In Vitro Induced Amphiploids of an Intergeneric Hybrid Erianthus arundinaceus x Saccharum spontaneum	SUGAR TECH	Erianthus arundinaceus, a wild relative of sugarcane, has great potential as a germplasm source to contribute valuable traits to sugarcane including better ratoonability, vigour and adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to introduce the desirable characters from this wild species to modern sugarcane cultivars. In most of these cases, it was constrained by lack of fertility. A rare hybrid between E. arundinaceus (IK 76-78, 2n = 60) x Saccharum spontaneum (Iritty-2, 2n = 64) has been developed as an intermediate hybrid to transfer the characters from E. arundinaceus to sugarcane cultivars. This hybrid, CYM 04-420, with somatic chromosome number 2n = 62 was subjected to in vitro colchicine treatment, and amphiploids were developed with 2n = 124. We report here for the first time the chromosome composition and chromosome pairing behaviour of S. spontaneum x E. arundinaceus intergeneric amphiploid via genomic in situ hybridization. The implications of the results from this study for introgression of genes from E. arundinaceus in sugarcane breeding programmes are discussed in the paper.	2017	10.1007/s12355-016-0482-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Primard-Brisset, C; Poupard, JP; Horvais, R; Eber, F; Pelletier, G; Renard, M; Delourme, R	A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F-2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family.	2005	10.1007/s00122-005-2059-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Caffeine inheritance in interspecific hybrids of Coffea arabica x Coffea canephora (Gentianales, Rubiaceae)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY	Caffeine inheritance was investigated in F-2 and BC1F1 generations between Coffea arabica var. Bourbon Vermelho (BV) and Coffea canephora var. Robusta 4x (R4x). The caffeine content of seeds and leaves was determined during 2004 and 2005. Microsatellite loci-markers were used to deduce the meiotic pattern of chromosome pairing of tetraploid interspecific hybrids. Genetic analysis indicated that caffeine content in seeds was quantitatively inherited and controlled by genes with additive effects. The estimates of broad-sense heritability of caffeine content in seeds were high for both generations. In coffee leaves, the caffeine content (BSH) from the same populations showed transgressive segregants with enhanced levels and high BSH. Segregation of loci-markers in BC1F1 populations showed that the ratios of the gametes genotype did not differ significantly from those expected assuming random associations and tetrasomic inheritance. The results confirm the existence of distinct mechanisms controlling the caffeine content in seeds and leaves, the gene exchange between the C. arabica BV and C. canephora R4x genomes and favorable conditions for improving caffeine content in this coffee population.	2008	10.1590/S1415-47572008000300017		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Priya, B. N. V.; Reddy, T. Venkata; Chidanand, U.; Saiprasad, G. V. S.	Development of KASP marker for cytoplasmic male sterility in Nicotiana tabacum and utilization in trait introgression	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an important trait for large-scale hybrid seed production which avoids manual emasculation and undesired horizontal spread of pollen. Rearrangements in mitochondrial genome in terms of deletions and insertions are frequent causes leading to CMS. Mitochondrial ATP synthase is a multisubunit molecular machine which is involved in synthesis of ATP. In this study, three mutations in ATPase subunit 6 were identified and their cosegregation with male sterility was established using tobacco male sterile hybrids and Nicotiana suvaolensis. A breeder friendlyKompetitive allele specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) SNP marker was developed for high throughput and quick genotyping. Introgression of this trait into selected germplasm lines (n = 9) was achieved based on foreground for CMS and background selection for recurrent parent using KASP marker and 50K custom tobacco SNP array, respectively. Analysis of genotyping data from SNP array revealed the presence of 88-99% of recurrent parent genome in BC3F1 plants. The selected BC3F1 plants exhibit CMS and are indistinguishable from the fertile recurrent parent (germplasm) in terms of plant morphology.	2019	10.1007/s12041-019-1128-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

The effects on grain endosperm structure of an introgression from Aegilops speltoides Tausch. into chromosome 5A of bread wheat	EUPHYTICA	The endosperm structure of the wheat kernel determines its end-use quality. The known diversity in endosperm structure is related to the Pina-D1 and Pinb-D1 genes comprising the Ha locus on chromosome 5DS. We studied the effect of a gene introduced into bread wheat from the diploid relative, Aegilops speltoides, a putative donor of the B genome. Grain hardness and vitreousness were investigated in lines with homoeologous introgressions into chromosome 5A of spring wheat cultivar 'Rodina'. One introgression changed the endosperm texture from hard to soft and had the same effect when transferred to other wheat genotypes. This indicated that its action was analogous to the dominant allele at the Ha locus. The temporary symbol Ha-Sp is given to the gene. Segregation for vitreousness in F(3) offspring from monosomic hybrids was also investigated. Genetic variability for endosperm structure in wheat may be extended by manipulating both hardness and vitreousness. Wheat germplasm with introgressions from wild relatives can increase the genetic variability of milling characteristics.	2010	10.1007/s10681-010-0168-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

However, a deficiency of two essential amino acids (lysine and tryptophan) significantly reduces the nutritional quality of maize proteins. The recessive opaque-2 (o2) mutant has a greater content of lysine and tryptophan in their endosperm proteins and their bioavailability is better. Therefore, marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) was attempted to incorporate the o2 allele from the donor line VQL 1 into the genetic background of UMI 1200 to develop quality protein maize (QPM) lines. Foreground selection for the gene o2 was effected using tightly linked molecular marker umc1066, in UMI 1200 x VQL 1 backcross series. Further, background selection was done together with stringent phenotypic selection for agronomic traits, to accelerate recurrent parent phenome recovery. As a result, three advanced QPM maize lines (DBT 4-1-1/25-10/25-10/25-16, DBT 4-1-1/25-10/25-17/25-11 and DBT 4-1-1/25-10/25-17/25-13) carrying the opaque-2 allele in a homozygous state, similar to VQL 1 were developed. The lysine and tryptophan content of these lines ranged from 0.35% to 0.40% and 0.03 to 0.05%, respectively, which is on par with the VQL 1.

Pyne, Robert M.; Honig, Josh A.; Vaiciunas, Jennifer; Wyenandt, Christian A.; Simon, James E.	Population structure, genetic diversity and downy mildew resistance among Ocimum species germplasm	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: The basil (Ocimum spp.) genus maintains a rich diversity of phenotypes and aromatic volatiles through natural and artificial outcrossing. Characterization of population structure and genetic diversity among a representative sample of this genus is severely lacking. Absence of such information has slowed breeding efforts and the development of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) with resistance to the worldwide downy mildew epidemic, caused by the obligate oomycete Peronospora belbahrii. In an effort to improve classification of relationships 20 EST-SSR markers with species-level transferability were developed and used to resolve relationships among a diverse panel of 180 Ocimum spp. accessions with varying response to downy mildew. Results: Results obtained from nested Bayesian model-based clustering, analysis of molecular variance and unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) analyses were synergized to provide an updated phylogeny of the Ocimum genus. Three (major) and seven (sub) population (cluster) models were identified and well-supported (P < 0.001) by PhiPT (phi(PT)) values of 0.433 and 0.344, respectively. Allelic frequency among clusters supported previously developed hypotheses of allopolyploid genome structure. Evidence of cryptic population structure was demonstrated for the k1 O. basilicum cluster suggesting prevalence of gene flow. UPGMA analysis provided best resolution for the 36-accession, DM resistant k3 cluster with consistently strong bootstrap support. Although the k3 cluster is a rich source of DM resistance introgression of resistance into the commercially important k1 accessions is impeded by reproductive barriers as demonstrated by multiple sterile F1 hybrids. The k2 cluster located between k1 and k3, represents a source of transferrable tolerance evidenced by fertile backcross progeny. The 90-accession k1 cluster was largely susceptible to downy mildew with accession 'MRI' representing the only source of DM resistance. Conclusions: High levels of genetic diversity support the observed phenotypic diversity among Ocimum spp. accessions. EST-SSRs provided a robust evaluation of molecular diversity and can be used for additional studies to increase resolution of genetic relationships in the Ocimum genus. Elucidation of population structure and genetic relationships among Ocimum spp. germplasm provide the foundation for improved DM resistance breeding strategies and more rapid response to future disease outbreaks.	2018	10.1186/s12870-018-1284-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Qi, Lili; Long, Yunming; Talukder, Zahirul I.; Seiler, Gerald J.; Block, Charles C.; Gulya, Thomas J.	Genotyping-by-Sequencing Uncovers the Introgression Alien Segments Associated with Sclerotinia Basal Stalk Rot Resistance from Wild Species-I. Helianthus argophyllus and H. petiolaris	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS	Basal stalk rot (BSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is a devastating disease in sunflower worldwide. The progress of breeding for Sclerotinia BSR resistance has been hampered due to the lack of effective sources of resistance for cultivated sunflower. Our objective was to transfer BSR resistance from wild annual Helianthus species into cultivated sunflower and identify the introgressed alien segments associated with BSR resistance using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. The initial crosses were made between the nuclear male sterile HA 89 with the BSR resistant plants selected from wild Helianthus argophyllus and H. petiolaris populations in 2009. The selected resistant F1 plants were backcrossed to HA 458 and HA 89, respectively. Early generation evaluations of BSR resistance were conducted in the greenhouse, while the BC2F3 and subsequent generations were evaluated in the inoculated field nurseries. Eight introgression lines; six from H. argophyllus (H.arg 1 to H.arg 6), and two from H. petiolaris (H.pet 1 and H.pet 2), were selected. These lines consistently showed high levels of BSR resistance across seven environments from 2012 to 2015 in North Dakota and Minnesota, USA. The mean BSR disease incidence (DI) for H.arg 1 to H.arg 6, H.pet 1, and H.pet 2 was 3.0, 3.2, 0.8, 7.2, 7.7, 1.9, 2.5, and 4.4%, compared to a mean DI of 36.1% for Cargill 270 (susceptible hybrid), 31.0% for HA 89 (recurrent parent), 19.5% for HA 441 (resistant inbred), and 11.6% for Croplan 305 (resistant hybrid). Genotyping of the highly BSR resistant introgression lines using GBS revealed the presence of the H. argophyllus segments in linkage groups (LGs) 3, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the sunflower genome, and the H. petiolaris segments only in LG8. The shared polymorphic SNP loci in the introgression lines were detected in LGs 8, 9, 10, and 11, indicating the common introgression regions potentially associated with BSR resistance. Additionally, a downy mildew resistance gene, P177, derived from one of the parents, HA 458, was integrated into five introgression lines. Germplasms combining resistance to Sclerotinia BSR and downy mildew represent a valuable genetic source for sunflower breeding to combat these two destructive diseases.	2016	10.3389/fgene.2016.00219		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Qian, CT; Jahn, MM; Staub, JE; Luo, XD; Chen, JF	Meiotic chromosome behaviour in an allotriploid derived from an amphidiploid x diploid mating in Cucumis	PLANT BREEDING	A synthetic amphidiploid species Cucumis hytivus Chen & Kirkbride (2n = 4x = 38; genome designated as HHCC) has recently been created from an interspecific mating between C. sativus L. (2n = 2x = 14; genome designated as CC) and C. hystrix Chakr. (2n = 2x = 24; genome designated as HH). This amphidiploid is resistant to root knot nematode, tolerant to low irradiance, and has higher nutritional value than standard processing cucumber cultivars. An allotriploid (2n 3x = 26; HCC) was derived from a cross between C. salivus L. and C. hytivus Chen & Kirkbride. Diploid meiotic behaviour in C. sativus and C. hystrix involves the development of seven and 12 metaphase bivalents respectively. In the derived allotriploid, univalents, bivalents, and trivalents (at relatively low frequency) were observed at metaphase I indicating that some homeologues from the C and H genomes can synapse. Based on a comparative karyotype analysis of cucumber (i.e. chromosome size and pairing behaviour) and allotriploid plants, the seven bivalents observed at metaphase I were ascertained to be cucumber homologues, while the 12 univalents were of C. hystrix origin thus confirming the allotriploid karyotypic constitution to be HCC. On average, the frequency of trivalents was 0.24 at diakinesis and 0.22 in 100 meiocytes at metaphase 1, indicating the possibility of genetic exchange due to the homoeology between the C and H genomes. After simultaneous cytokinesis, only polyads were observed in pollen mother cells (PMCs) at telophase 11, which led to the production of sterile pollen grains. Multi-polarization of chromosomes was dominant at anaphase II. However, in about 20% PMCs, chromosomes separated to form a 7C + 1-2H complement, suggesting a possible method for the production of alien addition cucumber-C. hysirix lines through further backcrossing of the allotriploid to diploid cucumber.	2005	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2005.01066.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics study	FALSE			FALSE	
Qian, W; Chen, X; Fu, D; Zou, J; Meng, J	Intersubgenomic heterosis in seed yield potential observed in a new type of Brassica napus introgressed with partial Brassica rapa genome	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	This paper reports the observation on the intersubgenomic heterosis for seed yield among hybrids between natural Brassica napus (A(n)A(n)C(n)C(n)) and a new type of B. napus with introgressions of genomic components of Brassica rapa (A(r)A(r)). This B. napus was selected from the progeny of B. napus x B. rapa and ( B. napus x B. rapa) x B. rapa based on extensive phenotypic and cytological observation. Among the 129 studied partial intersubgenomic hybrids, which were obtained by randomly crossing 13 lines of the new type of B. napus in F-3 or BC1F3 to 27 cultivars of B. napus from different regions as tester lines, about 90% of combinations exceeded the yield of their respective tester lines, whereas about 75% and 25% of combinations surpassed two elite Chinese cultivars, respectively. This strong heterosis was further confirmed by reevaluating 2 out of the 129 combinations in a successive year and by surveying hybrids between 20 lines of the new type of B. napus in BC1F5 and its parental B. napus in two locations. Some DNA segments from B. rapa were identified with significant effects on seed yield and yield components of the new type of B. napus in BC1F5 and intersubgenomic hybrids in positive or negative direction. It seems that the genomic components introgressed from B. rapa contributed to improvement of seed yield of rapeseed.	2005	10.1007/s00122-005-1932-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Raghavendra, P.; Hittalmani, S.	Novel male sterile line development through marker-assisted backcross breeding suitable for aerobic planting in rice	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY	Aim : Availability of suitable hybrids for drought or cultivation under aerobic situation is scarce in rice. Therefore, there is a dire need for developing of potential male sterile line for the production of promising hybrids. In this way, present study conducted was development of male sterile line suitable for aerobic rice hybrids in limited generations with the use of marker assisted backcrossing. Methodology : The present study was conducted using strategy of marker assisted background selection for the development of new malesterile line in rice. A male sterile line KCMS31A was used as a donor parent for male sterility and a promising genotype MAS99 (early maturing and suitable for aerobic condition) as a recurrent parent. Backcrossing was carried out from 2013 to 2014. Phenotypic foreground selection was carried out in each generation by pollen fertility test. Based on parental polymorphism survey, 96 polymorphic SSR markers were identified and utilised for the marker assisted background selection in BC4F1 generation. Further, BC4F1 plants were evaluated for morphological characters. Results : Analysis of data showed that all the plants were totally male sterile and the plants coded as BC3F1-5-7 (96.88%), BC3F1-5-10 (96.88%), BC3F1-5-15 (96.88%) and BC3F1-5-17 (95.83%) were found to be recovered maximum recurrent parent genome and they were advanced to BC4F1. Evaluation of new BC4F1 male sterile line pertaining to morphological traits revealed that the trait means were on par with the original fertile counterpart MAS99 B line. Interpretation : The results confirmed the supremacy of marker assisted selection in backcross breeding aimed at the recovery of recurrent parent genome as quickly as possible and this is the first effort made by authors to develop male sterile line fit to utilise in hybrid rice programme under aerobic condition.	2018	10.22438/jeb/09/3/MRN-525		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression was not measured	FALSE			FALSE

Identification of a major QTL, Sub1 and advancements in marker-assisted backcrossing strategy enabled breeders to develop submergence tolerant versions of popular rice cultivars. In the present study, a marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) approach was used to introgress the Sub1 locus from the tolerant FR13A variety into CO 43, one of the popular rice varieties of southern India. Evaluation of early generation segregating progenies derived from the cross of CO 43 and FR13A revealed the introgression of Sub1, leading to increased tolerance to submergence and better revival ability after it. Genotyping and phenotyping of BC3F3 generation resulted in elite NILs of CO 43 harbouring Subl the locus and possessing 94.37% and 95.78% of the recurrent parental CO 43 genome. Selected NILs performed equal as the recurrent parent CO 43 under normal conditions, but were more tolerant to submergence and revived better, afterwards. Under flooding NILs yielded about 25-30% higher than the recurrent parent CO 43.	2018	10.17221/149/2017-CJGPB		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

Mismatch repair (MMR) is one of the systems that maintain genome integrity and prevent homeologous recombination. In all eukaryotes mismatches are recognized by evolutionary conserved MSH proteins often acting as heterodimers, the constant component of which is MSH2. Changes affecting the function of MSH2 gene may induce a 'mutator' phenotype and microsatellite instability (MSI), as is demonstrated in MSH2 knock-out and silenced lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. The goal of this study was to screen for 'mutator' phenotypes in somatic hybrids between potato cvs. 'Delikat' and 'Desiree' and MMR deficient Solanum chacoense transformed using antisense (AS) or dominant negative mutant (DN) AtMSH2 genes. The results demonstrate that first generation fusion hybrids have a range of morphological abnormalities caused by uniparental MMR deficiency; these mutant phenotypes include: dwarf or gigantic plants; bushiness; curled, small, large or abnormal leaves; a deterioration in chloroplast structure; small deep-purple tubers and early dehiscent flowers. Forty percent of the viable somatic hybrids planted in a greenhouse, (10 out of 25 genotypes) had mutant phenotypes accompanied by MSI. The majority of the hybrids with 'mutator' phenotypes cultured on media containing kanamycin developed roots so sustaining the presence of selectable marker gene nptII, from the initial constructs. Here for the first time, MMR deficiency combined with somatic hybridization, are used to induce new phenotypes in plants, which supports the role of MMR deficiency in increasing introgressions between two related species.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.00003		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Ramos, Joie M.; Furuta, Tomoyuki; Uehara, Kanako; Chihiro, Niwa; Angeles-Shim, Rosalyn B.; Shim, Junghyun; Brar, Darshan S.; Ashikari, Motoyuki; Jena, Kshirod K.	Development of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of Oryza longistaminata A. Chev. & Rohr in the background of the elite japonica rice cultivar, Taichung 65 and their evaluation for yield traits	EUPHYTICA	Oryza longistaminata (AA genome) is a wild rice species that is phenotypically inferior to cultivated rice but possesses useful alleles that can be used to improve agronomically important traits. Interspecific hybrids that are derived from cultivated rice and wild rice species with AA genome are important contributors of genetic diversity in rice. To illustrate the potential of wild rice relatives as a source of novel alleles for rice improvement, a total of 40 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of O. longistaminata in the background of the elite japonica cultivar Taichung 65 were developed and evaluated for yield and various yield-related traits. A number of CSSLs carrying putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling different yield-related traits were identified during both dry and wet seasons. In particular, 10 major putative QTLs controlling early heading date, plant height, tiller number, panicle length, number of primary branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, grain width, and grain thickness were identified. Interestingly, one of the CSSL lines, LTSL26, with major putative QTLs on chromosomes 1 and 8 that increase grain number per panicle, showed pleiotropic effects on other traits such as plant height, days to flowering, tiller number, number of branches per panicle, and grain length. These results suggest that O. longistaminata is a good source of new alleles that can be used to improve yield-related traits in cultivated rice varieties.	2016	10.1007/s10681-016-1685-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Ramzan, Fahad; Younis, Adnan; Lim, Ki-Byung	Application of Genomic In Situ Hybridization in Horticultural Science	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENOMICS	Molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as in situ hybridization methods, are admirable tools to analyze the genomic structure and function, chromosome constituents, recombination patterns, alien gene introgression, genome evolution, aneuploidy, and polyploidy and also genome constitution visualization and chromosome discrimination from different genomes in allopolyploids of various horticultural crops. Using GISH advancement as multicolor detection is a significant approach to analyze the small and numerous chromosomes in fruit species, for example, Diospyros hybrids. This analytical technique has proved to be the most exact and effective way for hybrid status confirmation and helps remarkably to distinguish donor parental genomes in hybrids such as Clivia, Rhododendron, and Lycoris ornamental hybrids. The genome characterization facilitates in hybrid selection having potential desirable characteristics during the early hybridization breeding, as this technique expedites to detect introgressed sequence chromosomes. This review study epitomizes applications and advancements of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) techniques in horticultural plants.	2017	10.1155/2017/7561909		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Rashid, M. Harunur; Hausner, Georg; Fernando, W. G. Dilantha	Molecular and phenotypic identification of B-genome introgression linked to Leptosphaeria maculans resistant gene Rlm6 in Brassica napusxB-juncea interspecific hybrids	EUPHYTICA	Blackleg is a devastating disease in canola worldwide, except in China, caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans. The B-genome Brassica species were reported to have a strong resistance to the blackleg pathogen L. maculans. Backcross (BC) generations, BC1F1 to BC4F1, were derived from a cross B. napusxB. juncea. Phenotype of L. maculans isolate J20 showed that 49% of BC1F1, 27% of BC2F1, 15% of BC3F1, and 10% of BC4F1 plants were resistant to the isolate J20. Offspring from the interspecific hybridization were also analysed for the presence of dominant type SCAR markers detecting loci linked to the B. juncea genome. The plants with B. juncea introgression had a decrease in the presence of SCAR markers ranging from 47% in BC1F1 to 30% in BC2F1 and further down to 18% in BC3F1 and 11% in BC4F1 with respect to the marker B5Rlm6_1. A similar trend of loci reduction was also observed for the marker B5-1520. In contrast, the progression of the B. napus genome correlated with an incremental increase in the presence of the two markers with the advancement of the generations. However, segregation of SCAR markers and phenotypes for the blackleg resistance in BC1F1 plants had an acceptable fit to a Mendelian ratio of resistant versus susceptible, supporting the assumption that the genetic control of resistance is governed by a single dominant gene. The BC generations developed in this study, which show introgression of the B. juncea genome linked to the L. maculans resistance gene Rlm6, would facilitate breeding a B. napus variety resistant to blackleg in the future.	2018	10.1007/s10681-018-2287-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Rehman, M.; Hansen, J. L.; Mallory-Smith, C. A.; Hang, An; Burton, C.; Zemetra, R. S.	Determining the Pollen Parent of Field-Grown Backcross Progenies of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) x Jointed Goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host) Hybrids Using Genomic In Situ Hybridization (GISH)	CROP SCIENCE	Jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host) with CCDD genomes is a noxious weed of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Wheat (BBAADD) and jointed goatgrass (JGG) can hybridize under natural conditions, leading to a possibility of gene flow between these two species. For a gene to move from herbicide-resistant wheat to JGG, JGG must be the recurrent parent in a series (two) of backcrosses. One way of determining the pollen parent in the first backcross is to visualize C-genome chromosomes using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). By using GISH it was determined that 7 of 88 (8%) BC1 plants had more than seven C-genome chromosomes, indicating that JGG was the pollen parent. By using wheat-specific chloroplast simple sequence repeat marker (WCt-3) analysis, 13.6% of the hybrids had wheat as the female parent, while the remaining plants had JGG as the female parent. This study presents a reliable way of determining the pollen parent of BC1 progeny and the hybridization dynamics between wheat and jointed goatgrass under natural field conditions This information can be used to more accurately predict the risk for gene migration between wheat and jointed goatgrass.	2010	10.2135/cropsci2009.09.0509		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Rehman, Maqsood; Hansen, Jennifer L.; Mallory-Smith, Carol A.; Zemetra, Robert S.	Impact of transgene genome location on gene migration from herbicide-resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE	BACKGROUNDWheat (Triticum aestivum) (ABD) and jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) (CD) can cross and produce hybrids that can backcross to either parent. Such backcrosses can result in progeny with chromosomes and/or chromosome segments retained from wheat. Thus, a herbicide resistance gene could migrate from wheat to jointed goatgrass. In theory, the risk of gene migration from herbicide-resistant wheat to jointed goatgrass is more likely if the gene is located on the D genome and less likely if the gene is located on the A or B genome of wheat. RESULTSBC1 populations (jointed goatgrass as a recurrent parent) were analyzed for chromosome numbers and transgene transmission rates under sprayed and non-sprayed conditions. Transgene retention in the non-sprayed BC1 generation for the A, B and D genomes was 84, 60 and 64% respectively. In the sprayed populations, the retention was 81, 59 and 74% respectively. CONCLUSIONThe gene transmission rates were higher than the expected 50% or less under sprayed and non-sprayed conditions, possibly owing to meiotic chromosome restitution and/or chromosome non-disjunction. Such high transmission rates in the BC1 generation negates the benefits of gene placement for reducing the potential of gene migration from wheat to jointed goatgrass.

Ren, Yi; McGregor, Cecilia; Zhang, Yan; Gong, Guoyi; Zhang, Haiying; Guo, Shaogui; Sun, Honghe; Cai, Wantao; Zhang, Jie; Xu, Yong	An integrated genetic map based on four mapping populations and quantitative trait loci associated with economically important traits in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus)	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Modern watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) cultivars share a narrow genetic base due to many years of selection for desirable horticultural qualities. Wild subspecies within C. lanatus are important potential sources of novel alleles for watermelon breeding, but successful trait introgression into elite cultivars has had limited success. The application of marker assisted selection (MAS) in watermelon is yet to be realized, mainly due to the past lack of high quality genetic maps. Recently, a number of useful maps have become available, however these maps have few common markers, and were constructed using different marker sets, thus, making integration and comparative analysis among maps difficult. The objective of this research was to use single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) anchor markers to construct an integrated genetic map for C. lanatus. Results: Under the framework of the high density genetic map, an integrated genetic map was constructed by merging data from four independent mapping experiments using a genetically diverse array of parental lines, which included three subspecies of watermelon. The 698 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 219 insertion-deletion (InDel), 36 structure variation (SV) and 386 SNP markers from the four maps were used to construct an integrated map. This integrated map contained 1339 markers, spanning 798 cM with an average marker interval of 0.6 cM. Fifty-eight previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 12 traits in these populations were also integrated into the map. In addition, new QTL identified for brix, fructose, glucose and sucrose were added. Some QTL associated with economically important traits detected in different genetic backgrounds mapped to similar genomic regions of the integrated map, suggesting that such QTL are responsible for the phenotypic variability observed in a broad array of watermelon germplasm. Conclusions: The integrated map described herein enhances the utility of genomic tools over previous watermelon genetic maps. A large proportion of the markers in the integrated map are SSRs, InDels and SNPs, which are easily transferable across laboratories. Moreover, the populations used to construct the integrated map include all three watermelon subspecies, making this integrated map useful for the selection of breeding traits, identification of QTL, MAS, analysis of germplasm and commercial hybrid seed detection.	2014	10.1186/1471-2229-14-33		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Renny-Byfield, Simon; Ainouche, Malika; Leitch, Ilia J.; Lim, K. Yoong; Le Comber, Steven C.; Leitch, Andrew R.	Flow cytometry and GISH reveal mixed ploidy populations and Spartina nonaploids with genomes of S. alterniflora and S. maritima origin	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background The genus Spartina exhibits extensive hybridization and includes classic examples of recent speciation by allopolyploidy. In the UK there are two hexaploid species, S. maritima and S. alterniflora, as well as the homoploid hybrid S. x townsendii (2n = 60) and a derived allododecaploid S. anglica (2n = 120, 122, 124); the latter two are considered to have originated in Hythe, southern England at the end of the 19th century. Methods Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and flow cytometry were used to characterize the genomic composition and distribution of these species and their ploidy levels at Eling Marchwood and Hythe, both near Southampton, southern England. Key Results GISH identified approx. 60 chromosomes each of S. maritima and S. alterniflora origin in S. anglica and 62 chromosomes from S. alterniflora and 30 chromosomes from S. maritima in a nonaploid individual from Eling Marchwood, UK. GISH and flow cytometry also revealed that most (94%) individuals examined at Hythe were hexaploid (the remaining two individuals (6%) were dodedcaploid; n = 34), whereas hexaploid (approx. 36% of plants), nonaploid (approx. 27 %) and dodecaploid (approx. 36 %) individuals were found at Eling Marchwood (n 22). Conclusions Nonaploid individuals indicate the potential for introgression between hexaploid and dodecaploid species, complicating the picture of polyploid-induced speciation within the genus. Despite the aggressive ecological habit of S. anglica, it has not out-competed S. x townsendii at Hythe (homoploid hybrids at a frequency of 94 %, n = 34), despite > 100 years of coexistence. The success of GISH opens up the potential for future studies of polyploid-induced genome restructuring in this genus.	2010	10.1093/aob/mcq008		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Rey, Maria-Dolores; Martin, Azahara C.; Higgins, Janet; Swarbreck, David; Uauy, Cristobal; Shaw, Peter; Moore, Graham	Exploiting the ZIP4 homologue within the wheat Ph1 locus has identified two lines exhibiting homoeologous crossover in wheat-wild relative hybrids	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Despite possessing related ancestral genomes, hexaploid wheat behaves as a diploid during meiosis. The wheat Ph1 locus promotes accurate synapsis and crossover of homologous chromosomes. Interspecific hybrids between wheat and wild relatives are exploited by breeders to introgress important traits from wild relatives into wheat, although in hybrids between hexaploid wheat and wild relatives, which possess only homoeologues, crossovers do not take place during meiosis at metaphase I. However, in hybrids between Ph1 deletion mutants and wild relatives, crossovers do take place. A single Ph1 deletion (ph1b) mutant has been exploited for the last 40 years for this activity. We show here that chemically induced mutant lines, selected for a mutation in TaZIP4-B2 within the Ph1 locus, exhibit high levels of homoeologous crossovers when crossed with wild relatives. Tazip4-B2 mutant lines may be more stable over multiple generations, as multivalents causing accumulation of chromosome translocations are less frequent. Exploitation of such Tazip4-B2 mutants, rather than mutants with whole Ph1 locus deletions, may therefore improve introgression of wild relative chromosome segments into wheat.	2017	10.1007/s11032-017-0700-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Risso-Pascotto, C; Pagliarini, MS; do Valle, CB	Meiotic behavior in interspecific hybrids between Brachiaria ruziziensis and Brachiaria brizantha (Poaceae)	EUPHYTICA	The meiotic behavior of two half-sib interspecific tetraploid (2n = 4x = 36) promising hybrids, a sexual and an apomictic one, from crosses B. ruziziensis and B. brizantha, was evaluated. Although chromosome paired predominantly as bivalents, a few tri- and quadrivalents were recorded. Results suggest that B. brizantha and B. ruziziensis are closely related and genetic recombination is expected in hybrids. Introgression of specific target genes from B. ruziziensis into B. brizantha and vice-versa may be foreseen. However, abnormalities such as irregular chromosome segregation, chromosome stickiness and abnormal cytokinesis reported in these hybrids affect pollen fertility. More than 65% of pollen grains are sterile. Since the distinctive cytological feature of these hybrids is abnormal cytokinesis, this fact suggests that both parental genomes are unable to coordinate their activities with regard to this cytological phenomenon. Deployment of such hybrids in the process of developing varieties is discussed.	2005	10.1007/s10681-005-0893-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics study	FALSE			FALSE

Neal, Jr.	Genetic load and transgenic mitigating genes in transgenic Brassica rapa (field mustard) x Brassica napus (oilseed rape) hybrid populations	BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY	Background: One theoretical explanation for the relatively poor performance of Brassica rapa (weed) x Brassica napus (crop) transgenic hybrids suggests that hybridization imparts a negative genetic load. Consequently, in hybrids genetic load could overshadow any benefits of fitness enhancing transgenes and become the limiting factor in transgenic hybrid persistence. Two types of genetic load were analyzed in this study: random/linkage-derived genetic load, and directly incorporated genetic load using a transgenic mitigation (TM) strategy. In order to measure the effects of random genetic load, hybrid productivity (seed yield and biomass) was correlated with crop-and weed-specific AFLP genomic markers. This portion of the study was designed to answer whether or not weed x transgenic crop hybrids possessing more crop genes were less competitive than hybrids containing fewer crop genes. The effects of directly incorporated genetic load (TM) were analyzed through transgene persistence data. TM strategies are proposed to decrease transgene persistence if gene flow and subsequent transgene introgression to a wild host were to occur. Results: In the absence of interspecific competition, transgenic weed x crop hybrids benefited from having more crop-specific alleles. There was a positive correlation between performance and number of B. napus crop-specific AFLP markers [seed yield vs. marker number (r = 0.54, P = 0.0003) and vegetative dry biomass vs. marker number (r = 0.44, P = 0.005)]. However under interspecific competition with wheat or more weed-like conditions (i.e. representing a situation where hybrid plants emerge as volunteer weeds in subsequent cropping systems), there was a positive correlation between the number of B. rapa weed-specific AFLP markers and seed yield (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001), although no such correlation was detected for vegetative biomass. When genetic load was directly incorporated into the hybrid genome, by inserting a fitness-mitigating dwarfing gene that that is beneficial for crops but deleterious for weeds (a transgene mitigation measure), there was a dramatic decrease in the number of transgenic hybrid progeny persisting in the population. Conclusion: The effects of genetic load of crop and in some situations, weed alleles might be beneficial under certain environmental conditions. However, when genetic load was directly incorporated into transgenic events, e. g., using a TM construct, the number of transgenic hybrids and persistence in weedy genomic backgrounds was significantly decreased.	2009	10.1186/1472-6750-9-93		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Rosyara, Umesh; Kishii, Masahiro; Payne, Thomas; Sansaloni, Carolina Paola; Singh, Ravi Prakash; Braun, Hans-Joachim; Dreisigacker, Susanne	Genetic Contribution of Synthetic Hexaploid Wheat to CIMMYT's Spring Bread Wheat Breeding Germplasm	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	Synthetic hexaploid (SH) wheat (AABBD'D') is developed by artificially generating a fertile hybrid between tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum, AABB) and diploid wild goat grass (Aegilops tauschii, D'D'). Over three decades, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) has developed and utilized SH wheat to bridge gene transfer from Ae. tauschii and durum wheat to hexaploid bread wheat. This is a unique example of success utilizing wild relatives in mainstream breeding at large scale worldwide. Our study aimed to determine the genetic contribution of SH wheat to CIMMYT's global spring bread wheat breeding program. We estimated the theoretical and empirical contribution of D' to synthetic derivative lines using the ancestral pedigree and marker information using over 1,600 advanced lines and their parents. The average marker-estimated D' contribution was 17.5% with difference in genome segments suggesting application of differential selection pressure. The pedigree-based contribution was correlated with marker-based estimates without providing chromosome segment specific variation. Results from international yield trials showed that 20% of the lines were synthetic derived with an average D' contribution of 15.6%. Our results underline the importance of SH wheat in maintaining and enhancing genetic diversity and genetic gain over years and is important for development of a more targeted introgression strategy. The study provides retrospective view into development and utilization of SH in the CIMMYT Global Wheat Program.	2019	10.1038/s41598-019-47936-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Rowe, Heather C.; Rieseberg, Loren H.	Genome-scale transcriptional analyses of first-generation interspecific sunflower hybrids reveals broad regulatory compatibility	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Interspecific hybridization creates individuals harboring diverged genomes. The interaction of these genomes can generate successful evolutionary novelty or disadvantageous genomic conflict. Annual sunflowers Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris have a rich history of hybridization in natural populations. Although first-generation hybrids generally have low fertility, hybrid swarms that include later generation and fully fertile backcross plants have been identified, as well as at least three independently-originated stable hybrid taxa. We examine patterns of transcript accumulation in the earliest stages of hybridization of these species via analyses of transcriptome sequences from laboratory-derived F1 offspring of an inbred H. annuus cultivar and a wild H. petiolaris accession. Results: While nearly 14% of the reference transcriptome showed significant accumulation differences between parental accessions, total F1 transcript levels showed little evidence of dominance, as midparent transcript levels were highly predictive of transcript accumulation in F1 plants. Allelic bias in F1 transcript accumulation was detected in 20% of transcripts containing sufficient polymorphism to distinguish parental alleles; however the magnitude of these biases were generally smaller than differences among parental accessions. Conclusions: While analyses of allelic bias suggest that cis regulatory differences between H. annuus and H. petiolaris are common, their effect on transcript levels may be more subtle than trans-acting regulatory differences. Overall, these analyses found little evidence of regulatory incompatibility or dominance interactions between parental genomes within F1 hybrid individuals, although it is unclear whether this is a legacy or an enabler of introgression between species.	2013	10.1186/1471-2164-14-342		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Ruffel, S; Gallois, JL; Lesage, ML; Caranta, C	The recessive potyvirus resistance gene pot-1 is the tomato orthologue of the pepper pvr2-eIF4E gene	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS	The translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) has been implicated in naturally occurring resistance to Potato virus Y (PVY) determined by the pvr2 locus in pepper (Capsicum annuum). Here, the molecular basis of the recessive resistance to PVY and Tobacco etch virus (TEV) controlled by the pot-1 locus in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum; now Solanum lycopersicum) was investigated. On the basis of genetic mapping data that indicated that pot-1 and pvr2 are located in syntenic regions of the tomato and pepper genomes, the possible involvement of eIF4E in pot-1-mediated resistance was assessed. Genetic mapping of members of the eIF4E multigenic family in tomato introgression lines revealed that an eIF4E locus indeed maps in the same genomic region as pot-1. By comparing eIF4E coding sequences between resistant and susceptible Lycopersicon genotypes, a small number of polymorphisms that co-segregate with the pot-1 locus were identified, suggesting that this gene could be involved in resistance to potyviruses. Functional complementation experiments using Potato virus X-mediated transient expression of eIF4E from a susceptible genotype in a resistant pepper genotype confirmed that a small number of amino acid substitutions in the eIF4E protein indeed account for resistance/susceptibility to both the PVY and TEV, and consequently that pot-1 and pvr2 are orthologues. Taken together, these results support the role of this eIF4E gene as a key component of recessive resistance to potyviruses, and validate the comparative genomic approach for the molecular characterization of recessive resistance genes.	2005	10.1007/s00438-005-0003-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line/crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Sacks, Erik J.; Robinson, A. Forest	Introgression of resistance to reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) into upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) from Gossypium arboreum and a G. hirsutum/Gossypium aridum bridging line	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH	Gossypium hirsutum L. is the predominant cotton of commerce and all cultivars of this species are susceptible to the reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis. To introgress resistance to R. reniformis into the tetraploid 2(AD(1)) G. hirsutum, a resistant diploid A(2)-genome Gossypium arboreum accession (A(2)-190) was crossed with a hexaploid 2((AD(1))D(4)) bridging line (G 371) to obtain a tetraploid triple-species hybrid. The triple-species hybrid was back-crossed to G. hirsutum and a population of 277 BC(1) individuals was produced. The BC(1)s and controls were assayed in growth chambers for resistance to R. reniformis. Fortuitously, the hexaploid bridging line G 371 was also found to be resistant to R. reniformis. The BC(1) segregated 3:1, resistant: susceptible, indicating that resistance was conferred by dominant genes at two different loci, with each originating from a distinct germplasm Source. This study demonstrated that it is possible to introgress and pyramid genes for resistance to R. reniformis in G. hirsutum.

Sakaguchi, Kouhei; Nishijima, Ryo; Iehisa, Julio Cesar Masaru; Takumi, Shigeo	Fine mapping and genetic association analysis of Net2, the causative D-genome locus of low temperature-induced hybrid necrosis in interspecific crosses between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii	GENETICA	Hybrid necrosis has been observed in many interspecific hybrids from crosses between tetraploid wheat and the wheat D-genome donor Aegilops tauschii. Type II necrosis is a kind of hybrid incompatibility that is specifically characterized by low-temperature induction and growth suppression. Two complementary genes, Net1 on the AB genome and Net2 on the D genome, putatively control type II necrosis in ABD triploids and synthetic hexaploid wheat. Toward map-based cloning of Net2, a fine map around the Net2 region on 2DS was constructed in this study. Using the draft genome sequence of Ae. tauschii and the physical map of the barley genome, the Net2 locus was mapped within a 0.6 cM interval between two closely linked markers. Although local chromosomal rearrangements were observed in the Net2-corresponding region between the barley/Brachypodium and Ae. tauschii genomes, the two closely linked markers were significantly associated with type II necrosis in Ae. tauschii. These results suggest that these markers will aid efficient selection of Net2 non-carrier individuals from the Ae. tauschii population and intraspecific progeny, and could help with introgression of agriculturally important genes from Ae. tauschii to common wheat.	2016	10.1007/s10709-016-9920-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Marker-assisted pyramiding of opaque2 and novel opaque16 genes for further enrichment of lysine and tryptophan in sub-tropical maize	PLANT SCIENCE	The improvement of protein quality in maize so far has been based on recessive opaque2 (o2) mutant that along with endosperm-modifiers led to development of quality protein maize (QPM). Recent discovery of nutritional benefits of recessive opaque16 (o16) mutant was of immense significance for further improvement of protein quality. In the present study, o16 was introgressed into o2-based parental inbreds (HKI161, HKI193-1, HKI193-2 and HKI163) of four commercial QPM hybrids (HQPM-1, HQPM-4, HQPM-5 and HQPM-7) released in India, using marker-assisted backcross breeding. Background selection led to high recovery of recurrent parent genome (RPG) to maximum of 95%, and introgressed progenies showed considerable phenotypic resemblance for plant-, ear- and grain- characteristics to their respective recurrent parents. Selection of markers for o2 and o16 led to development of pyramided lines (o2o2/o16o16) that possessed as high as 76% and 91% more lysine and tryptophan over the recurrent parents, respectively. Reconstituted hybrids showed an average enhancement of 49% and 60% in lysine and tryptophan over the original hybrids, with highest enhancement amounting 64% and 86%, respectively. This is first report of enhancement of both lysine and tryptophan by o16 in maize genotypes adaptable to sub-tropics. Moderate variation in lysine and tryptophan was also observed in pyramided lines. Multi-location evaluation of reconstituted hybrids revealed similar grain yield and attributing traits to their original versions. This study signified the role of o16 as supplementary to o2 for nutritional quality enhancement in maize, and improved elite inbreds and hybrids developed here hold great significance in maize biofortification programme.	2018	10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.04.014		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Schelfhout, C. J.; Snowdon, R.; Cowling, W. A.; Wroth, J. M.	Tracing B-genome chromatin in Brassica napus x B-juncea interspecific progeny	GENOME	We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to demonstrate the presence of Brassica B-genome chromosomes and putative B-genome introgressions in B. napus x B. juncea interspecific progeny., The B-genome - specific repeat sequence pBNBH35 was used to generate PCR products and FISH probes. The highest frequencies of viable progeny were obtained when B. napus was the maternal parent of the interspecific hybrid and the first backcross. B-genome - positive PCR assays were found in 34/51 fertile F-2 progeny (67%), which was more than double the proportion found in fertile BC, progeny. Four B-genome - positive F-2-derived families and I BC1-derived family were fixed or segregating for B. juncea morphology in the F-4 and BC1S2, respectively, but in only 2 of these families did B. juncea-type plants exhibit B. juncea chromosome count (2n = 36) and typical B-genome FISH signals on 16 chromosomes. The remaining B. juncea-type plants had B. napus chromosome count (2n = 38) and no B-genome FISH signals, except for 1 exceptional F-4-derived line that exhibited isolated and weak B-genome FISH signals on 11 chromosomes and typical A-genome FISH signals. B. juncea morphology was associated with B-genome - positive PCR signals but not necessarily with 16 intact B-genome chromosomes as detected by FISH. B-genome chromosomes tend to be eliminated during selfing or backcrossing after crossing B. juncea with B. napus, and selection of lines containing B-genome chromatin during early generations would be promoted by use of this B-genome repetitive marker.	2006	10.1139/G06-103		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Enhancement of genetic diversity in canola-quality Brassica napus and B-juncea by interspecific hybridisation	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH	Reciprocal crosses were made between Brassica napus cv. Mystic (canola) and B. juncea JN29 (near canola quality). The F(1) hybrids were selfed and backcrossed in all possible combinations to parent plants. The greatest number of selfed fertile progeny were obtained when Mystic was the maternal parent, and its F(1) was most successful in backcrosses to Mystic or JN29 as maternal or paternal parent. The predominant morphological type of fertile progeny was B. napus, but several B. juncea morphological types occurred in F(2) and BC(1)-derived lines. F(2 : 3) and BC(1)S(0 : 1) progeny showed transgressive segregation for agronomic and seed quality traits in two contrasting field environments. Several of the B. juncea- type progeny had improved seed quality (lower total seed glucosinolates and higher % oleic acid) over the B. juncea parent. Selfing of interspecific hybrids between canola-quality B. napus and B. juncea has the potential to greatly enhance genetic diversity in canola-quality progeny of both species, without the loss of donor alleles that normally occurs with repeated backcrossing.	2008	10.1071/AR07425		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Schoenenberger, N; Felber, F; Savova-Bianchi, D; Guadagnuolo, R	Introgression of wheat DNA markers from A, B and D genomes in early generation progeny of Aegilops cylindrica Host x Triticum aestivum L. hybrids	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Introgression from allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L., AABBDD) to allotetraploid jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host, CCDD) can take place in areas where the two species grow in sympatry and hybridize. Wheat and Ae. cylindrica share the D genome, issued from the common diploid ancestor Aegilops tauschii Coss. It has been proposed that the A and B genome of bread wheat are secure places to insert transgenes to avoid their introgression into Ae. cylindrica because during meiosis in pentaploid hybrids, A and B genome chromosomes form univalents and tend to be eliminated whereas recombination takes place only in D genome chromosomes. Wheat random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments, detected in intergeneric hybrids and introgressed to the first backcross generation with Ae. cylindrica as the recurrent parent and having a euploid Ae. cylindrica chromosome number or one supernumerary chromosome, were assigned to wheat chromosomes using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic wheat lines. Introgressed fragments were not limited to the D genome of wheat, but specific fragments of A and B genomes were also present in the BC1. Their presence indicates that DNA from any of the wheat genomes can introgress into Ae. cylindrica. Successfully located RAPD fragments were then converted into highly specific and easy-to-use sequence characterised amplified regions (SCARs) through sequencing and primer design. Subsequently these markers were used to characterise introgression of wheat DNA into a BC1S1 family. Implications for risk assessment of genetically modified wheat are discussed.	2005	10.1007/s00122-005-0063-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Schoenenberger, Nicola; Guadagnuolo, Roberto; Savova-Bianchi, Dessislava; Kupfer, Philippe; Felber, Francois	Molecular analysis, cytogenetics and fertility of introgression lines from transgenic wheat to Aegilops cylindrica host	GENETICS	Natural hybridization and backcrossing between Aegilops cylindrica and Triticum aestivum can lead to intro-gression of wheat DNA into the wild species. Hybrids between Ae. cylindrica and wheat lines bearing herbicide resistance (bar), reporter (gus), fungal disease resistance (kp4), and increased insect tolerance (gna) transgenes were produced by pollination of emasculated Ae. cylindrica plants. F-1 hybrids were backcrossed to Ae. cylindrica under open-pollination conditions, and first backcrosses were selfed using pollen bags. Female fertility of F, ranged from 0.03 to 0.6%. Eighteen percent of the sown BC1s germinated and flowered. Chromosome numbers ranged from 30 to 84 and several of the plants bore wheat-specific sequence-characterized amplified regions (SCARs) and the bar gene. Self fertility in two BC1 plants was 0.16 and 5.21%, and the others were completely self-sterile. Among 19 BC1S1 individuals one plant was transgenic, had 43 chromosomes, contained the bar gene, and survived glufosinate treatments. The other BC1S1 plants had between 28 and 31 chromosomes, and several of them carried SCARs specific to wheat A and D genomes. Fertility of these plants was higher under open-pollination conditions than by selfing and did not necessarily correlate with even or euploid chromosome number. Some individuals having supernumerary wheat chromosomes recovered frill fertility.	2006	10.1534/genetics.106.058529		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Scott, JW	Perspectives on tomato disease resistance breeding: Past, present, and future	Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Tomato Diseases	Multiple-disease-resistant varieties have become prevalent as a result of disease resistance breeding that began about 70 years ago. Most of the resistances are conferred by single dominant, vertical genes that fit well with hybrid breeding that is common in today's world. Varietal progress has been most evident with soilborne fungal diseases such as; Fusarium wilt (races 1, 2, and more recently 3), Verticillium wilt (race 1), Alternaria stem canker, and to some degree with Fusarium crown rot. Varieties with major gene resistance to foliar fungal pathogens such as gray leafspot and Cladosporium leaf mold (two genes usually used) are common, while a few varieties have resistance to some races of late blight. Single dominant viral resistance genes are used in varieties resistant to tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and more recently spotted wilt virus. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) resistant varieties have recently emerged with one or more sometimes undescribed major genes conferring resistance. Varieties with bacterial resistance are rare with the exception of those with resistance to bacterial speck (Pto gene). Breeders have had much less success with quantitative or horizontal genetic resistances. Varieties with such resistances are rare, although successful varieties often have less susceptibility to various diseases than other varieties. Much work in the last couple of decades has focused on developing molecular markers linked to resistance genes and these are most useful where disease screening is cumbersome. Marker assisted selection will play a larger role in the future and will be an asset in working with quantitative resistance systems. Many disease resistance genes are clustered in the genome. As more resistance genes are added to single varieties, future issues for resistance breeding will involve unfavorable repulsion linkages between clustered resistance loci and unforeseen actions of the resistance genes themselves. An example of the latter between tomato mottle virus infection and ToMV resistance is described.	2005	10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.695.24		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Semel, Yaniv; Nissenbaum, Jonathan; Menda, Naama; Zinder, Michael; Krieger, Uri; Issman, Noa; Pleban, Tzili; Lippman, Zachary; Gur, Amit; Zamir, Dani	Overdominant quantitative trait loci for yield and fitness in tomato	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is a major genetic force that contributes to world food production. The genetic basis of heterosis is not clear, and the importance of loci with overdominant (ODO) effects is debated. One problem has been the use of whole-genome segregating populations, where interactions often mask the effects of individual loci. To assess the contribution of ODO to heterosis in the absence of epistasis, we carried out quantitative genetic and phenotypic analyses on a population of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) introgression lines (ILs), which carry single marker-defined chromosome segments from the distantly related wild species Solanum pennellii. The ILs revealed 841 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 35 diverse traits measured in the field on homozygous and heterozygous plants. ILs showing greater reproductive fitness were characterized by the prevalence of ODO QTL, which were virtually absent for the nonreproductive traits. ODO can result from true ODO due to allelic interactions of a single gene or from pseudo ODO that involves linked loci with dominant alleles in repulsion. The fact that we detected dominant and recessive QTL for all phenotypic categories but ODO only for the reproductive traits indicates that pseudo ODO due to random linkage is unlikely to explain heterosis in the ILs. Thus, we favor the true ODO model involving a single functional Mendelian locus. We propose that the alliance of ODO QTL with higher reproductive fitness was selected for in evolution and was domesticated by man to improve yields of crop plants.	2006	10.1073/pnas.0604635103		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Development of submergence-tolerant rice cultivars: the Sub1 locus and beyond	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Submergence is a recurring problem in the rice-producing rainfed lowlands of south and south-east Asia. Developing rice cultivars with tolerance of submergence and with agronomic and quality traits acceptable to farmers is a feasible approach to address this problem. The objectives of this study were to (a) develop mega varieties with Sub1 introgression that are submergence tolerant, (b) assess the performance of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds, (c) determine the roles of the Sub1A and Sub1C genes in conferring tolerance, and (d) assess the level of tolerance in F-1 hybrids heterozygous for the Sub1A-1-tolerant allele. Tolerant varieties were developed by marker-assisted backcrossing through two or three backcrosses, and their performance was evaluated to determine the effect of Sub1 in different genetic backgrounds. The roles of Sub1A and Sub1C in conferring the tolerant phenotype were further investigated using recombinants identified within the Sub1 gene cluster based on survival and gene expression data. All mega varieties with Sub1 introgression had a significantly higher survival rate than the original parents. An intolerant Sub1C allele combined with the tolerant Sub1A-1 allele did not significantly reduce the level of tolerance, and the Sub1C-1 expression appeared to be independent of the Sub1A allele; however, even when Sub1C-1 expression is completely turned off in the presence of Sub1A-2, plants remained intolerant. Survival rates and Sub1A expression were significantly lower in heterozygotes compared with the homozygous tolerant parent. Sub1 provided a substantial enhancement in the level of tolerance of all the sensitive mega varieties. Sub1A is confirmed as the primary contributor to tolerance, while Sub1C alleles do not seem important. Lack of dominance of Sub1 suggests that the Sub1A-1 allele should be carried by both parents for developing tolerant rice hybrids.	2009	10.1093/aob/mcn206		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Serra, Octavio; Manuel Donoso, Jose; Picanol, Roger; Batlle, Ignasi; Howad, Werner; Eduardo, Iban; Arus, Pere	Marker-assisted introgression (MAI) of almond genes into the peach background: a fast method to mine and integrate novel variation from exotic sources in long intergeneration species	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	This paper proposes a new breeding strategy, marker-assisted introgression (MAI), to obtain lines of perennial species with a single introgressed fragment from a compatible species two generations after the interspecific hybrid. MAI allows enrichment of the genome of a species with genes from a wild or exotic relative in a short timeframe and with an intermediate step that allows a first exploration of genes/QTLs that the donor species can provide to the target crop. This method has three phases: (1) creating a large backcross one (BC1) population to select, with markers, a reduced number of individuals (15-30, called the prIL set) with a low number of introgressions; (2) phenotyping the prIL set for the traits of interest and inferring the inheritance and map position of segregating major genes/QTLs based on the known genotypes of the prILs; and (3) advancing selected lines carrying the traits of interest to a next generation of backcross or selfing to obtain individuals with a single introgression in the background of the elite commercial germplasm. The proof of concept of this strategy was implemented by using peach as the recurrent species and almond as the donor. The whole process can be done in 9-10 years as the identification of the first line with one introgression was after 5 years (2006-2011), and 4-5 additional years are needed for phenotypic evaluation of selected lines. The expansion of this method to other perennial clonally propagated crops and to other species of Prunus compatible with peach is discussed.	2016	10.1007/s11295-016-1056-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Conversion of Molecular Markers Linked to Fusarium and Virus Resistance in Asiatic Lily Hybrids	XXIII INTERNATIONAL EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM, SECTION ORNAMENTALS: COLOURFUL BREEDING AND GENETICS	Lilies are one of the most economically important monocot flower bulbs. However, lily bulb production faces some challenges such as susceptibility to diseases caused by Fusarium oxysporum and Lily Mottle Virus (LMoV). These two are the most important pathogens that cause serious damage. Fortunately, some Asiatic lily hybrids show high level of resistance to Fusarium and LMoV. Transmission of these traits into the lily assortment through introgression is possible however combining several loci by conventional breeding will take a long time. Using marker-assisted selection (MAS) could speed up the breeding process considerably. A genetic map of an intraspecific Asiatic backcross population was constructed using three different molecular marker systems (DArT, AFLP and NBS profiling) and four QTLs for Fusarium oxysporum and one locus for LMoV were localized on this map. The most tightly linked markers to the most significant two Fusarium QTLs in the AA population were converted into more robust PCR markers. Thus, the first markers for MAS breeding in the very huge and highly repetitive genome of lily have been developed.	2009			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Transpositional activation of mPing in an asymmetric nuclear somatic cell hybrid of rice and Zizania latifolia was accompanied by massive element loss	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	We have reported previously that the most active miniature inverted terminal repeat transposable element (MITE) of rice, mPing, was transpositionally mobilized in several rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an introgressive hybridization between rice and wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.). To further study the phenomenon of hybridization-induced mPing activity, we undertook the present study to investigate the element's behavior in a highly asymmetric somatic nuclear hybrid (SH6) of rice and Z. latifolia, which is similar in genomic composition to that of the RILs, though probably contains more introgressed alien chromatins from the donor species than the RILs. We found that mPing, together with its transposase-donor, Pong, underwent rampant transpositional activation in the somatic hybrid (SH6). Because possible effects of protoplast isolation and cell culture can be ruled out, we attribute the transpositional activation of mPing and Pong in SH6 to the process of asymmetric somatic hybridization, namely, one-step introgression of multiple chromatin segments of the donor species Z. latifolia into the recipient rice genome. A salient feature of mPing transposition in the somatic hybrid is that the element's activation was accompanied by massive loss of its original copies, i.e., abortive transpositions, which was not observed in previously reported cases of mPing activity. These data not only corroborated our earlier finding that wide hybridization and introgression may trigger transpositional activation of otherwise quiescent transposable elements, but also suggest that transpositional mobilization of a MITE like mPing can be accompanied by dramatic reduction of its original copy numbers under certain conditions, thus provide novel insights into the dynamics of MITEs in the course of genome evolution.	2009	10.1007/s00122-009-1137-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybridization between different species plays an important role in plant genome evolution, as well as is a widely used approach for crop improvement. McClintock has predicted that plant wide hybridization constitutes a "genomic shock" whereby cryptic transposable elements may be activated. However, direct experimental evidence showing a causal relationship between plant wide hybridization and transposon mobilization has not yet been reported. The miniature-Ping (mPing) is a recently isolated active miniature inverted-repeat transposable element transposon from rice, which is mobilized by tissue culture and gamma-ray irradiation. We show herein that mPing, together with its putative transposase-encoding partner, Pong, is mobilized in three homologous recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from hybridization between rice (cultivar Matsumae) and wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.), harboring introgressed genomic DNA from wild rice. In contrast, both elements remain immobile in two lines sharing the same parentage to the RILs but possessing no introgressed DNA. Thus, we have presented direct evidence that is consistent with McClintock's insight by demonstrating a causal link between wide hybridization and transposon mobilization in rice. In addition, we report an atypical behavior of mPing/Pong mobilization in these lines, i.e., the exclusive absence of footprints after excision.	2005	10.1093/molbev/msi082		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Sharma, Brij B.; Kalia, Pritam; Singh, Dinesh; Sharma, Tilak R.	Introgression of Black Rot Resistance from Brassica carinata to Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis Group) through Embryo Rescue	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Black rot caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) is a very important disease of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis group) resulting into 10-50% yield losses every year. Since there is a dearth of availability of resistance to black rot disease in B. oleracea (C genome), therefore exploration of A and B genomes was inevitable as they have been reported to be potential reservoirs of gene(s) for resistance to black rot. To utilize these sources, interspecific hybrid and backcross progeny (B-1) were generated between cauliflower "Pusa Sharad" and Ethiopian mustard "NPC-9" employing in vitro embryo rescue technique. Direct ovule culture method was better than siliqua culture under different temperature regime periods. Hybridity testing of F-1 inter-specific plants was carried out using co-dominant SSR marker and Brassica B and C genome-specific (DB and DC) primers. Meiosis in the di-genomic (BCC) interspecific hybrid of B. oleracea botrytis group (2n = 18, CC) x B. carinata (2n = 4x = 34, BBCC) was higly disorganized and cytological analysis of pollen mother cells revealed chromosomes 2n = 26 at metaphase-I. Fertile giant pollen grain formation was observed frequently in interspecific F-1 hybrid and BC1 plants. The F-1 inter-specific plants were found to be resistant to Xcc race 1. Segregation distortion was observed in BC1 generation for black rot resistance and different morphological traits. The At1g70610 marker analysis confirmed successful introgression of black rot resistance in interspecific BC1 population. This effort will go a long way in pyramiding gene(s) for resistance against black rot in Cole crops, especially cauliflower and cabbage for developing durable resistance, thus minimize dependency on bactericides.	2017	10.3389/fpls.2017.01255		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Corresponding reductions to trait variation create the need, and an opportunity, to identify and harness the genetic capacity of wild species for crop improvement. Here we analyze trait segregation in a series of wild x cultivated hybrid populations to delineate the genetic underpinnings of domestication traits. Two species of wild chickpea, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum, were crossed with the elite, early flowering C. arietinum cultivar ICCV96029. KASP genotyping of F2 parents with an FT-linked molecular marker enabled selection of 284 F3 families with reduced phenological variation: 255 F3 families of C. arietinum x reticulatum (AR) derived from 17 diverse wild parents and 29 F3 families of C. arietinum x echinospermum (AE) from 3 wild parents. The combined 284 lineages were genotyped using a genotyping-by-sequencing strategy and phenotyped for agronomic traits. 50 QTLs in 11 traits were detected from AR and 35 QTLs in 10 traits from the combined data. Using hierarchical clustering to assign traits to six correlated groups and mixed model based multi-trait mapping, four pleiotropic loci were identified. Bayesian analysis further identified four inter-trait relationships controlling the duration of vegetative growth and seed maturation, for which the underlying pleiotropic genes were mapped. A random forest approach was used to explore the most extreme trait differences between AR and AE progenies, identifying traits most characteristic of wild species origin. Knowledge of the genomic basis of traits that segregate in wild-cultivated hybrid populations will facilitate chickpea improvement by linking genetic and phenotypic variation in a quantitative genetic framework.	2019	10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.04.018		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses/introgressions	FALSE			FALSE	
Sigel, Erin M.	Genetic and genomic aspects of hybridization in ferns	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	The morphological and ecological intermediacy of hybrid taxa has long interested and challenged fern biologists, resulting in numerous systematic contributions focused on disentangling relationships within reticulate species complexes. From a genetic perspective, hybrid ferns are especially interesting because they represent the union of divergent parental genomes in unique evolutionary entities. This review summarizes advances in our knowledge of the genetic and genomic aspects of hybridization in ferns from the mid-20th century to the present. The different organismal products of hybridization, evolutionary aspects of additive and non-additive gene expression in allopolyploids, genetic and genomic mechanisms leading to gene silencing and loss, the roles of multiple origins and introgression for imparting genetic variation to hybrid fern taxa and their progenitors, and the utility of allopolyploid ferns to investigate mechanisms of genome evolution in the homosporous ferns are discussed. Comparisons are made to other plant lineages and important future research directions are highlighted, with the goal of stimulating additional research on hybrid ferns.	2016	10.1111/jse.12226		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Review	FALSE			FALSE	
Silva, Goncalo Santos; Souza, Margarete Magalhaes; Ferreira de Melo, Clausio Antonio; Urdampilleta, Juan Domingo; Forni-Martins, Eliana Regina	Identification and characterization of karyotype in Passiflora hybrids using FISH and GISH	BMC GENETICS	Background: A great interest exists in the production of hybrid plants of the genus Passiflora given the beauty and exotic features of its flowers which have ornamental value. Hybrid paternity confirmation is therefore important for assuring germplasm origin, and is typically carried out by molecular marker segregation. The aim of this study was to karyotypically characterize the chromosome heritance patterns of the progeny resultant from a cross of P. gardneri and P. gibertii using classical cytogenetics, chromosome banding, and molecular cytogenetics. Results: All analyzed genotypes showed the same diploid chromosome number as the genitor species: 2n = 18. Classical and CMA(3) and DAPI staining allowed for chromosome counting and satellite identification (secondary constrictions). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) were used to characterize subgenomes by either identifying rDNA-specific genome patterns or parental genomes, respectively. Conclusions: The heritance of chromosomal markers presenting rDNA sites from each parent for genome identification confirmed that all obtained plants were hybrids. These results will improve breeding programs involving the species of this genus. Apart from confirming hybridization, GISH allowed the visualization of recombination between the homeologous chromosome and the introgression of sequences of interest.	2018	10.1186/s12863-018-0612-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytological analysis	FALSE			FALSE	
Singh, Amit K.; Zhang, Peng; Dong, Chongmei; Li, Jianbo; Singh, Smriti; Trethowan, Richard M.; Sharp, Peter J.	Development and molecular cytogenetic characterization of Thinopyrum bessarabicum introgression lines in hexaploid and tetraploid wheats	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Key message A variety of Thinopyrum bessarabicum introgressions in both hexaploid and tetraploid wheats were generated and characterized by molecular cytogenetic analysis. Six wheat-J genome recombinants were identified with ND-FISH and GISH. Diploid wheatgrass, Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14, (EEb)-E-b or J(b)J(b) or JJ), is a well-known alien source of salinity tolerance and disease resistance for wheat improvement. The true genetic potential and effect of such introgressions into wheat can be best studied in chromosomal addition or substitution lines. Here, we report the generation and characterization of various categories of Th. bessarabicum derivatives in both hexaploid and tetraploid cultivated wheats. Sequential non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) are robust techniques to visualize the size of alien introgressions and breakpoints. We identified a complete set of monosomic addition lines into both bread wheat and durum wheat, except for 7J in durum wheat, by sequential ND-FISH and GISH. We also characterized alien derivatives belonging to various classes including mono-telosomic additions, disomic additions, monosomic substitutions, double monosomic substitutions, monosomic substitution-monosomic additions, double monosomic additions, and multiple monosomic additions into both bread and durum wheats. In addition, various wheat-Th. bessarabicum recombinant chromosomes were also detected in six alien derivatives. These wheat-Th. bessarabicum derivatives will provide useful cytogenetic resources for improvement of both hexaploid and tetraploid wheats.		10.1007/s00122-020-03581-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Singh, Satinder; Kaur, Gurpreet; Gupta, Mehak; Banga, Shashi; Banga, S. S.	Genomic affinities between Brassica napus and Raphanus raphanistrum as revealed by meiotic GISH	PLANT BREEDING	An intergeneric hybrid between Brassica napus (AC, n=19) and Raphanus raphanistrum (Rr, n=9) was developed using the sequential ovary-ovule culture. Morphological, molecular, cytological studies and fluorescent genomic insitu hybridization were conducted to establish the hybridity and genomic relatedness. F-1 hybrid plants were male sterile and morphologically intermediate between the two parents. Cytological analysis of the hybrid plants revealed 10II+8I as the predominant meiotic configuration with the mean bivalent frequency of 8.83. A maximum of 13II were observed in 8.24% of the pollen mother cells (PMCs). GISH studies facilitated the identification of two allopairs, confirming homoeologous pairing between A/C and Rr genomes. This may have significant implications in terms of transgene flow and possible introgression into R.raphanistrum, which is a common canola weed in Canada and Australia. The intergeneric hybrid B.napusxR.raphanistrum so produced also has the potential to be used as a bridging species for the transfer of desirable genes to amphiploid crop Brassica species carrying A/C genomes.	2016	10.1111/pbr.12384		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

PEERJ	Background. The oat x maize addition (OMA) lines are used for mapping of the maize genome, the studies of centromere-specific histone (CENH3), gene expression, meiotic chromosome behavior and also for introducing maize C4 photosynthetic system to oat. The aim of our study was the identification and molecular-cytogenetic characterization of oat x maize hybrids. Methods. Oat DH lines and oat x maize hybrids were obtained using the wide crossing of Avena sativa L. with Zea mays L. The plants identified as having a Grande-1 retrotransposon fragment, which produced seeds, were used for genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Results. A total of 138 oat lines obtained by crossing of 2,314 oat plants from 80 genotypes with maize cv. Waza were tested for the presence of maize chromosomes. The presence of maize chromatin was indicated in 66 lines by amplification of the PCR product (500 bp) generated using primers specific for the maize retrotransposon Grande-1. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) detected whole maize chromosomes in eight lines (40%). All of the analyzed plants possessed full complement of oat chromosomes. The number of maize chromosomes differed between the OMA lines. Four OMA lines possessed two maize chromosomes similar in size, three OMA-one maize chromosome, and one OMA-four maize chromosomes. In most of the lines, the detected chromosomes were labeled uniformly. The presence of six 45S rDNA loci was detected in oat chromosomes, but none of the added maize chromosomes in any of the lines carried 45S rDNA locus. Twenty of the analyzed lines did not possess whole maize chromosomes, but the introgression of maize chromatin in the oat chromosomes. Five of 66 hybrids were shorter in height, grassy type without panicles. Twenty-seven OMA lines were fertile and produced seeds ranging in number from 1-102 (in total 613). Sixty-three fertile DH lines, out of 72 which did not have an addition of maize chromosomes or chromatin, produced seeds in the range of 1-343 (in total 3,758). Obtained DH and OMA lines were fertile and produced seeds. Discussion. In wide hybridization of oat with maize, the complete or incomplete chromosomes elimination of maize occur. Hybrids of oat and maize had a complete set of oat chromosomes without maize chromosomes, and a complete set of oat chromosomes with one to four retained maize chromosomes.	2018	10.7717/peerj.5107		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Slezina, M. P.; Korostyleva, T. V.; Slavokhotova, A. A.; Istomina, E. A.; Shcherbakova, L. A.; Pukhalskij, V. A.; Odintsova, T. I.	Genes Encoding Hevein-Like Antimicrobial Peptides from Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv. ex Nevski	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Earlier, we discovered a gene family encoding hevein-like antimicrobial peptides (WAMP) in the highly resistant wheat species Triticum kiharae Dorof. et Migusch. and related species of the Triticum and Aegilops genera. These peptides suppress growth and development of fungi and bacteria by inhibition of secreted metalloproteinases of the pathogens. In this study, we analyzed wamp homologs in the wild cereal Elytrigia repens Desv. ex Nevski, which is an invasive weed. The wamp homologs were isolated by PCR with E. repens genomic DNA or cDNA and primers specific to the wheat wamp genes. The nucleotide sequences of three novel E. repenswamp genes encoding the precursors of the antimicrobial peptides named ERAMP-1, ERAMP-2 and ERAMP-3 were determined. The mature peptide regions of the precursors differed in single amino acid substitutions. It was shown that ERAMP-2 and ERAMP-3 have valine at position 34 affecting the degree of fungal proteinase inhibition, which has not been found in other WAMP homologs. To elucidate the role of the valine residue in the E. repens peptide antifungal activity, the recombinant peptide was expressed in E. coli and its antifungal activity was assayed against a range of phytopathogenic fungi belonging to ascomycetes. The peptide was more active than the wheat WAMP-1 peptide against three of four tested fungi infecting cereals and other plant species. The results obtained contribute to our knowledge of the biodiversity of wamp genes in Poaceae. In addition, they expand our understanding of the repertoire of defensive genes in E. repens responsible for its enhanced pathogen resistance.	2018	10.1134/S1022795418100149		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Slovak, Marek; Urfus, Tomas; Vit, Petr; Marhold, Karol	The Balkan endemic Picris hispidissima (Compositae): morphology, nuclear DNA content and relationship to the polymorphic P. hieracioides	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	The only Balkan endemic of the genus Picris, Picris hispidissima, was studied in detail using morphological and karyological methods. The species was shown to be morphologically distinct from the closest taxon, Picris hieracioides, by the pectinate-ciliate indumentum of involucral bracts, dilatation of the peduncle, length of the outer and inner bracts, and indumentum colour. No morphological variation that would require taxonomic classification was found within this species. Despite the diploid chromosome number (2n = 2x = 10) being confirmed for P. hispidissima, variation of up to 9.5% in genome size was found. The likely explanation for this variation is hybridization and introgression with closely related P. hieracioides. The most convincing evidence for this hypothesis is the detection of plants with two clearly different DNA contents arising from a single capitulum found in the location where P. hispidissima and P. hieracioides co-occur.	2009	10.1007/s00606-008-0137-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	morphometrics	FALSE			FALSE	
Snowdon, Rod J.	Cytogenetics and genome analysis in Brassica crops	CHROMOSOME RESEARCH	The genus Brassica contains a wide range of diploid and amphipolyploid species including some of the most important vegetable, condiment and oilseed crops worldwide. As members of the Brassicaceae family the brassicas are the closest crop relatives to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and hence are major beneficiaries from the vast array of Arabidopsis molecular genetic and genomic tools and the increasingly good annotation to major Brassica crop genomes. In this review examples are shown from recent studies that demonstrate the potential for intergenome navigation from model to crop plant and for comparisons among genetic and cytogenetic maps between the model and crop species and among different crop brassicas. The use of interspecific and intergeneric hybridization for introgression of novel traits into Brassica genomes from the secondary and tertiary crucifer genepools is described. In this context the use of the Brassica triangle of three diploid species and their corresponding amphiploids as an excellent model system for studying the mechanisms and control of homeologous recombination and polyploidization is discussed from a crop breeding perspective.	2007	10.1007/s10577-006-1105-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Sommer, Leonhard; Spiller, Monika; Stiewe, Gunther; Pillen, Klaus; Reif, Jochen C.; Schulthess, Albert W.	Proof of concept to unmask the breeding value of genetic resources of barley (Hordeum vulgare) with a hybrid strategy	PLANT BREEDING	Broadening the genetic base of elite breeding programmes is crucial for further breeding success. The absence of major adaption genes, however, often masks the grain yield breeding value of genetic resources. We assessed the ability of a hybrid strategy to provide unbiased performance estimates of 21 barley genetic resources. By crossing them to elite tester lines, 25 three-way hybrids were produced and evaluated together with a part of their parents and eight elite hybrids for important agronomic traits in replicated field trials in four environments. The phenotypic data analyses revealed that the hybrid strategy facilitated to identify promising resources by substantially improving lodging resistance. Combining genotypic data for 5,562 SNPs with the phenotypic data highlighted the potential to boost the diversity of the elite breeding pool via targeted introgression of genetic resources into the male and female heterotic pools. We propose an application of the hybrid strategy for genetic resources of entire genebank collections and to use genome-wide predictions to support a targeted choice of accessions with high value for barley breeding.		10.1111/pbr.12795		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines/crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Stegemann, Sandra; Keuthe, Mandy; Greiner, Stephan; Bock, Ralph	Horizontal transfer of chloroplast genomes between plant species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	The genomes of DNA-containing cell organelles (mitochondria, chloroplasts) can be laterally transmitted between organisms, a process known as organelle capture. Organelle capture often occurs in the absence of detectable nuclear introgression, and the capture mechanism is unknown. Here, we have considered horizontal genome transfer across natural grafts as a mechanism underlying chloroplast capture in plants. By grafting sexually incompatible species, we show that complete chloroplast genomes can travel across the graft junction from one species into another. We demonstrate that, consistent with reported phylogenetic evidence, replacement of the resident plastid genome by the alien genome occurs in the absence of intergenomic recombination. Our results provide a plausible mechanism for organelle capture in plants and suggest natural grafting as a path for horizontal gene and genome transfer between sexually incompatible species.	2012	10.1073/pnas.1114076109		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	chloroplast transfer upin grafting experiments	FALSE			FALSE

Stewart, John F.; Will, Rodney E.; Crane, Barbara S.; Nelson, C. Dana	The genetics of shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata mill.) with implications for restoration and management	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) is an important commercial timber resource and forest ecosystem component in the southeastern USA. The species occurs in mainly drier sites as an early-to mid-successional species, is fire-adapted, and it plays an important role in the fire ecology of the region. However, shortleaf pine genetics are not well-studied, especially in this era of molecular genetics and genomics. Most genetics research about the species has focused on provenance testing. Generally, shortleaf pine performs well in colder areas, when compared to loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), a close relative, which is faster growing and the most common plantation species in the region. Though not as advanced in genetic improvement as loblolly pine, tree breeders have improved shortleaf pine in one to two generations of selection, and diverse, genetically improved shortleaf pine materials are available to foresters and landowners throughout the southeastern USA. Researchers have also studied the genetic variation of shortleaf pine using various molecular markers and have found that shortleaf pine is generally a prolific outcrosser, a trait it shares with other non-isolated members of the family Pinaceae. In recent years, however, it has shared less genetic material across long ranges, probably because of habitat fragmentation. Various anthropogenic factors also affect shortleaf pine's future, as recent studies show that shortleaf pine introgression with loblolly pine puts the species- and the resiliency of southeastern forests-at risk. Importantly, fire exclusion is a likely cause of the increase in introgression. Herein, we provide further details and up-to-date genetic information and resources for foresters and ecologists interested in the restoration and management of shortleaf pine.	2016	10.1007/s11295-016-1052-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	REVIEW	FALSE			FALSE	
Stift, Marc; Bregman, Rob; Oostermeijer, J. Gerard B.; van Tienderen, Peter H.	OTHER TETRAPLOID SPECIES AND CONSPECIFIC DIPLOIDS AS SOURCES OF GENETIC VARIATION FOR AN AUTOTETRAPLOID	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	Premise of the study: Most plants are polyploid and have more than two copies of the genome. The evolutionary success of polyploids is often attributed to their potential to harbor increased genetic variation, but it is poorly understood how polyploids can attain such variation. Because of their formation bottleneck, newly formed tetraploids start out with little variation. Tetraploids may attain genetic variation through a combination of new mutations, recurrent formation, and gene exchange with diploid ancestors or related tetraploid species. We explore the role of gene exchange and introgression in autotetraploid Rorippa amphibia, a species that harbors more genetic variation than its diploid ancestors. Methods: We crossed autotetraploid R. amphibia to diploid conspecifics and tetraploid R. sylvestris and backcrossed resulting F-1 hybrids. We used flow cytometry to determine the ploidy of all progeny. Key results: Tetraploids of R. amphibia and R. sylvestris were interfertile; F-1 hybrids were fertile and could backcross. Crosses between diploids and tetraploids yielded a small number of viable, often tetraploid progeny. This indicates that unreduced gametes can facilitate gene flow from diploids to tetraploids. We detected a frequency of unreduced gametes of around 2.7 per 1000, which was comparable between diploids and tetraploids. Conclusions: Introgression from tetraploid R. sylvestris provides a realistic source of variation in autotetraploid R. amphibia. Only in a scenario where other compatible partners are absent, for example immediately after tetraploidization, gene flow through unreduced gametes from diploids could be an important source of genetic variation for tetraploids.	2010	10.3732/ajb.1000048		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Sujatha, M.; Prabakaran, A. J.; Dwivedi, Sangam L.; Chandra, S.	Cytomorphological and molecular diversity in backcross-derived inbred lines of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)	GENOME	A set of 250 distinct, stable, and uniform backcross-derived inbred lines were developed in sunflower through 5 interspecific cross combinations involving 4 wild diploid annual species (Helianthus argophyllus, H. petiolaris, H. annuus, and H. debilis). The presence of the wild-species genome in these inbred lines was confirmed through higher chromosome associations (tri- and quadrivalents) at diakinesis. Maximum structural rearrangements of chromosomes were observed in lines derived from H. petiolaris. Forty morphologically diverse inbred lines along with 2 controls were subjected to measurements of phenotypic and genetic distance using 118 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of known map location. A total of 204 alleles were identified and the number of alleles per locus varied between 2 and 5. There were 46 unique alleles and the number of unique alleles was highest in the lines derived from the cross involving H. petiolaris. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.05 to 0.575. The pair-wise comparison values based on genetic dissimilarity estimates computed using molecular marker data varied between 0.143 and 0.486 among the 42 lines. The results indicate that the sunflower gene pool could benefit from introgression of novel alleles from the latent genetic diversity present in the wild species and particularly through exploitation of the diploid annual H. petiolaris.	2008	10.1139/G08-008		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Sun, Genlou	Molecular phylogeny revealed complex evolutionary process in Elymus species	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Recent molecular phylogenetic studies on Elymus have added to our understanding of the origination of Elymus species. However, evolutionary dynamics and speciation of most species in Elymus are unclear. Molecular phylogeny has demonstrated that reticulate evolution has occurred extensively in the genus, as an example, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (pepC) data revealed two versions of the St genome, St1 and St2 contributing to speciation of E. caninus. Phylogenetic analyses of E. pendulinus uncovered additional genome-level complexity. Our data indicated that both chloroplast and nuclear gene introgression have occurred in the evolutionary process of E. pendulinus. Non-donor species genomes have been detected in several Elymus species, such as in allohexaploid E. repens (StStStStHH), a Taeniatherum-like (Ta genome in Triticeae) GBSSI sequence, Bromus-(Bromeae) and Panicum-like (Paniceae) ITS sequences have been detected. The chloroplast DNA data indicated that Pseudoroegneria is the maternal genome donor to Elymus species, but whether different Elymus species originated from different St donors remains an open question. The origin of the Y genome in Elymus is puzzling. It is clear that theY genome is distinct from the St genome, but unclear on the relationships ofY to other genomes in Triticeae. Introgressive hybridization may be an important factor complicating the evolutionary history of the species in Elymus. The extent of introgression and its role in creating diversity in Elymus species should be the objective of further investigations.	2014	10.1111/jse.12080		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	REVIEW	FALSE			FALSE

PLANT BREEDING	Maize is an important food and feed crop worldwide. Phytic acid (PA), in maize kernel, is an antinutritional factor. PA chelates mineral cations and causes mineral deficiency in humans and phosphorous deficiency in animals. The undigested PA excreted by monogastric animals causes phosphorous eutrophication. Therefore, development of low-phytate maize is indispensable. The low-phytate locus (lpa2 allele) has been transferred from low-phytate mutant line EC 659418' into an elite inbred UMI 395 through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). The MABB involved three backcrosses followed by two selfing steps, including foreground selection', that is, selecting lines with lpa2 allele with the help of a codominant SSR marker umc2230' and background selection', that is, selecting plants having genetic background similar to that of the recurrent parent using 50 codominant SSR markers. Two low-phytate lpa2 lines with genome similar (>90% similarity) to that of recurrent parent have been identified. These lines can be used as parent in future hybridization programmes for obtaining low-phytate high-yielding maize hybrids.	2014	10.1111/pbr.12185		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Suteu, Dana; Bacila, Ioan; Has, Voichita; Has, Ioan; Miclaus, Mihai	Romanian Maize (Zea mays) Inbred Lines as a Source of Genetic Diversity in SE Europe, and Their Potential in Future Breeding Efforts	PLOS ONE	Maize has always been under constant human selection ever since it had been domesticated. Intensive breeding programs that resulted in the massive use of hybrids nowadays have started in the 60s. That brought significant yield increases but reduced the genetic diversity at the same time. Consequently, breeders and researchers alike turned their attention to national germplasm collections established decades ago in many countries, as they may hold allelic variations that could prove useful for future improvements. These collections are mainly composed of inbred lines originating from well-adapted local open pollinated varieties. However, there is an overall lack of data in the literature about the genetic diversity of maize in SE Europe, and its potential for future breeding efforts. There are no data, whatsoever, on the nutritional quality of the grain, primarily dictated by the zein proteins. We therefore sought to use the Romanian maize germplasm as an entry point in understanding the molecular make-up of maize in this part of Europe. By using 80 SSR markers, evenly spread throughout the genome, on 82 inbred lines from various parts of the country, we were able to decipher population structure and the existing relationships between those and the eight international standards used, including the reference sequenced genome B73. Corroborating molecular data with a standardized morphological, physiological, and biochemical characterization of all 90 inbred lines, this is the first comprehensive such study on the existing SE European maize germplasm. The inbred lines we present here are an important addition to the ever-shrinking gene pool that the breeding programs are faced-with, because of the allelic richness they hold. They may serve as parental lines in crosses that will lead to new hybrids, characterized by a high level of heterosis, nationwide and beyond, due to their existing relationship with the international germplasm.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0085501		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

QTL mapping with near-isogenic lines in maize	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	A set of 89 near-isogenic lines (NILs) of maize was created using marker-assisted selection. Nineteen genomic regions, identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism loci and chosen to represent portions of all ten maize chromosomes, were introgressed by backcrossing three generations from donor line Tx303 into the B73 genetic background. NILs were genotyped at an additional 128 simple sequence repeat loci to estimate the size of introgressions and the amount of background introgression. Tx303 introgressions ranged in size from 10 to 150 cM, with an average of 60 cM. Across all NILs, 89% of the Tx303 genome is represented in targeted and background introgressions. The average proportion of background introgression was 2.5% (range 0-15%), significantly lower than the expected value of 9.4% for third backcross generation lines developed without marker-assisted selection. The NILs were grown in replicated field evaluations in two years to map QTLs for flowering time traits. A parallel experiment of testcrosses of each NIL to the unrelated inbred, Mo17, was conducted in the same environments to map QTLs in NIL testcross hybrids. QTLs affecting days to anthesis, days to silking, and anthesis-silk interval were detected in both inbreds and hybrids in both environments. The testing environments differed dramatically for drought stress, and different sets of QTLs were detected across environments. Furthermore, QTLs detected in inbreds were typically different from QTLs detected in hybrids, demonstrating the genetic complexity of flowering time. NILs can serve as a valuable genetic mapping resource for maize breeders and geneticists.	2007	10.1007/s00122-007-0512-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Tahir, Muhammad Shafique; Khan, Noor-Ul-Islam; Sajid-Ur-Rehman	Development of an Interspecific Hybrid (Triploid) by Crossing Gossypium hirsutum and G. arboreum	CYTOLOGIA	The 2 species G. hit-minim and G. arboreum were crossed and triploid hybrid (AAD) was developed as a first step of crossing. The triploid is sterile and its hybridity was confirmed with morphological traits and DNA based SSR markers. The chromosome analysis at metaphase-I exhibited 13AA bivalents and 13D univalents at most of the PMC's studied which also confirmed its triploid nature. The mean chromosome pairing association was recorded as 12.90% (univalent), 10.45% (bivalent), 0.45% (trivalent), and 0.48% (tetravalent). The formation of multivalents depicted genome association between 2 species. The further utility of synthesized triploid with respect to the development of CLCuV resistant introgression genotypes is discussed	2011	10.1508/cytologia.76.193		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Tamura, Ken-ichi; Tase, Kazuhiro; Sanada, Yasuharu; Komatsu, Toshinori; Yonemaru, Jun-ichi; Kubota, Akito	Effects of introgressions from Festuca pratensis on winter hardiness of Lolium perenne	EUPHYTICA	Previous studies reported that some genotypes with introgressed Festuca chromosome segment(s) in Lolium genome showed enhanced winter hardiness compared to Lolium. The aim of this study was to search comprehensively for the Festuca pratensis chromosome regions affecting winter hardiness-related traits when introgressed into the Lolium perenne genome. Association between F. pratensis introgression and winter hardiness-related traits (fall and winter hardiness indexes, early-spring dry matter yield, and freezing tolerance) were screened in the diploid introgression populations (n = 203) that had some F. pratensis chromosome segments introgressed. Eighty-four intron markers corresponding to unique rice genes randomly distributed across the genome were used for genotyping. Winter hardiness of almost all plants in the introgression populations was lower than that of the F. pratensis and triploid hybrid parents, but the average was higher than that of L. perenne. A significant positive effect of F. pratensis introgression on early-spring dry matter yield was detected on chromosome 7. This quantitative trait locus (QTL) was confirmed by linkage analysis using a backcross population with F. pratensis introgression in the target region of chromosome 7. However, the contribution of the newly identified QTL was rather small (6.7-9.6%), suggesting that superior winter hardiness of F. pratensis compared to L. perenne is conferred by multiple small-effect QTLs. We also detected a previously unreported negative effect of Festuca introgression on winter hardiness. Newly obtained QTL information in this study would contribute to the design of Festuca/Lolium hybrid breeding.	2017	10.1007/s10681-017-1996-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Tamura, Ken-ichi; Yonemaru, Jun-ichi; Hisano, Hiroshi; Kanamori, Hiroyuki; King, Julie; King, Ian P.; Tase, Kazuhiro; Sanada, Yasuharu; Komatsu, Toshinori; Yamada, Toshihiko	Development of intron-flanking EST markers for the Lolium/Festuca complex using rice genomic information	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	DNA markers able to distinguish species or genera with high specificity are valuable in the identification of introgressed regions in interspecific or intergeneric hybrids. Intergeneric hybridization between the genera of Lolium and Festuca, leading to the reciprocal introgression of chromosomal segments, can produce novel forage grasses with unique combinations of characteristics. To characterize Lolium/Festuca introgressions, novel PCR-based expression sequence tag (EST) markers were developed. These markers were designed around intronic regions which show higher polymorphism than exonic regions. Intronic regions of the grass genes were predicted from the sequenced rice genome. Two hundred and nine primer sets were designed from Lolium/Festuca ESTs that showed high similarity to unique rice genes dispersed uniformly throughout the rice genome. We selected 61 of these primer sets as insertion-deletion (indel)-type markers and 82 primer sets as cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers to distinguish between Lolium perenne and Festuca pratensis. Specificity of these markers to each species was evaluated by the genotyping of four cultivars and accessions (32 individuals) of L. perenne and F. pratensis, respectively. Evaluation using specificity indices proposed in this study suggested that many indel-type markers had high species specificity to L. perenne and F. pratensis, including 15 markers completely specific to both species. Forty-nine of the CAPS markers completely distinguish between the two species at bulk level. Chromosome mapping of these markers using a Lolium/Festuca substitution line revealed syntenic relationships between Lolium/Festuca and rice largely consistent with previous reports. This intron-based marker system that shows a high level of polymorphisms between species in combination with high species specificity will consequently be a valuable tool in Festulolium breeding.	2009	10.1007/s00122-009-1003-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker dev.

Tan, GX; Jin, HJ; Li, G; He, RF; Zhu, LL; He, GG	Production and characterization of a complete set of individual chromosome additions from Oryza officinalis to Oryza sativa using RFLP and GISH analyses	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) are valuable materials for comparative analyses of two distinct genomes, for elucidating introgression mechanisms, and for dissecting genes controlling complex traits. In the study reported here, MAALs of rice containing the complete genome of Oryza sativa and individual chromosomes of Oryza officinalis were produced. Interspecific hybridizations were made between O. sativa L. ssp. Japonica (CV, Hejiang 19, 2 n=24, AA) and O. officinalis (Acc. HY018, 2 n=24, CC). Two backcrosses were made to the cultivated rice to obtain BC2F1 plants. Through RFLP and GISH analyses, 25 MAALs (2 n=25, AA+1C) were identified and divided into 12 syntenic groups, designated MAALs 1-12. MAALs 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 were each represented by one plant, MAALs 8, 11 and 12 by two plants, MAALs 6 and 9 by four plants, and MAAL 4 by five plants. An ideogram of the C-genome of O. officinalis was constructed, based on GISH analysis of the interspecific hybrid and the MAALs. Comparative RFLP maps showed strong syntenic associations between the A-genomes and C-genomes. Chromosomal arrangements such as translocations and duplications were detected in different alien chromosomes of the MAALs. The complete set of O. officinalis MAALs generated here provides a novel manipulation platform for exploiting and utilizing the O. officinalis genome and carrying out genetic studies.	2005	10.1007/s00122-005-0090-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Tang, QL; Rong, TZ; Song, YC; Yang, JP; Pan, GT; Li, WC; Huang, YB; Cao, MJ	Introgression of perennial teosinte genome into maize and identification of genomic in situ hybridization and microsatellite markers	CROP SCIENCE	To transfer desirable characters from perennial teosinte [Zea perennis (Hitchc.) Reeves & Mangelsd.] into maize (Z. mays L.), we have generated an interspecific hybrid and its backcross generations (BC1F3). The maize X perennial teosinte BC1F3 (MZI202) resembled maize, with chromosome number 2n = 20. MZI202 was studied by multicolor genomic in situ hybridization (McGSH) and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) microsatellites markers. The McGISH experiments provided direct evidence that MZI202 was a maize-perennial teosinte substitution line with introgression of three alien chromosomes from perennial teosinte. The SSR assay further confirmed that a single chromosome 6 and the pair of chromosome 10 of maize were replaced by perennial teosinte chromosomes in MZI202.	2005	10.2135/cropsci2005.0717		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
Tang, Shunxue; Okashah, Rebecca A.; Knapp, Steven J.; Arnold, Michael L.; Martin, Noland H.	Transmission ratio distortion results in asymmetric introgression in Louisiana Iris	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Linkage maps are useful tools for examining both the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and the evolution of reproductive incompatibilities. We describe the generation of two genetic maps using reciprocal interspecific backcross 1 (BC1) mapping populations from crosses between Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva. These maps were constructed using expressed sequence tag (EST)- derived codominant microsatellite markers. Such a codominant marker system allowed for the ability to link the two reciprocal maps, and compare patterns of transmission ratio distortion observed between the two. Results: Linkage mapping resulted in markers that coalesced into 21 linkage groups for each of the reciprocal backcross maps, presumably corresponding to the 21 haploid chromosomes of I. brevicaulis and I. fulva. The composite map was 1190.0-cM long, spanned 81% of the I. brevicaulis and I. fulva genomes, and had a mean density of 4.5 cM per locus. Transmission ratio distortion (TRD) was observed in 138 (48.5%) loci distributed in 19 of the 21 LGs in BCIB, BCIF, or both BC1 mapping populations. Of the distorted markers identified, I. fulva alleles were detected at consistently higher-than-expected frequencies in both mapping populations. Conclusions: The observation that I. fulva alleles are overrepresented in both mapping populations suggests that I. fulva alleles are favored to introgress into I. brevicaulis genetic backgrounds, while I. brevicaulis alleles would tend to be prevented from introgressing into I. fulva. These data are consistent with the previously observed patterns of introgression in natural hybrid zones, where I. fulva alleles have been consistently shown to introgress across species boundaries.	2010	10.1186/1471-2229-10-48		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Tang, Xueqin; Shi, Dong; Xu, Jie; Li, Yinglu; Li, Wenjing; Ren, Zhenglong; Fu, Tihua	Molecular cytogenetic characteristics of a translocation line between common wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium with resistance to powdery mildew	EUPHYTICA	Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis (DC) Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal is a serious disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Southwestern China. A line of common wheat designated 08-723 isolated from the progeny of a hybrid between common wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & Dewey, was highly resistant to the existing powdery mildew races in the region. This line had a similar phenotype to its wheat parent, and it showed normal bivalent pairing at metaphase I of meiosis. It was analyzed by genomic in situ hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization and sequential C-banding-GISH to determine the amount, location and origin of the alien chromatin present. The results revealed that line 08-723 is homozygous for a two-point translocation replacing chromosome 6A of wheat. The translocation chromosome appears to have a normal 6AL arm; its short arm has a short terminal segment of ca. 10 % in length originating from an unidentified B-genome chromosome of wheat and a long proximal segment of ca. 90 % of the arms' length originating from one of the St-genome chromosomes of Th. intermedium. Genetic analysis of powdery mildew resistance in F-1, F-2 and F-2:3 populations from a cross of 08-723 with a susceptible wheat line indicated that the resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene and in a sample of F2 plants it always associated with the translocated chromosome. The gene responsible for resistance on the translocated chromosome may provide an alternate source of resistance in wheat breeding programs.	2014	10.1007/s10681-013-1059-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Taunk, Jyoti; Rani, Asha; Yadav, Neelam R.; Yadav, Dev Vart; Yadav, Ram C.; Raj, Kushal; Kumar, Ramesh; Yadav, H. P.	Molecular breeding of ameliorating commercial pearl millet hybrid for downy mildew resistance	JOURNAL OF GENETICS	Downy mildew (DM) caused by Sclerospora graminicola is the most calamitous disease of pearl millet. Therefore, for introgression of DM resistance (DMR) in HHB 197 (MH-1302), an elite pearl millet hybrid, a marker-assisted breeding was undertaken by targeting three DMR loci on linkage groups (LGs) 1, 2 and 4. Breeding programme was initiated by crossing HBL 11 (DM susceptible), male parent of HHB 197 hybrid with ICMP 451 (DM-resistant) to produce true F1 plants. By conducting three rounds of backcrossing and selection, BC3F1 lines were generated. Foreground selection was employed using six polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of the 18 total selected markers. Four of these markers were linked to LG 1, five to LG 2 and nine to LG 4. Background selection was performed in BC3F1 generation using 33 polymorphic SSR markers of a total of 56 evenly spread SSR markers in the pearl millet genome to check recovery of recurrent parent genome. On the basis of genotypic selection (foreground as well as background) using selected SSR markers, agronomic performance in field and DM screening in greenhouse; 10 improved HBL 11 lines were selected and crossed with ICMA 97111 to produce DM-resistant HHB 197 hybrid versions. Six putatively improved HHB 197 hybrids were successfully tested in first year trials at Hisar and Bawal locations of Haryana and two selected versions with higher yield and zero DM incidence will be further tested in multilocation trials.	2018	10.1007/s12041-018-1016-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Taylor, Sunni J.; Arnold, Michael; Martin, Noland H.	THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IN LOUISIANA IRISES: HYBRID FITNESS IN NATURE	EVOLUTION	Negative epistasis in hybrid genomes commonly results in postzygotic isolation between divergent lineages. However, some genomic regions may be selectively neutral or adaptive in hybrids and thus may potentially cross species barriers. We examined postzygotic isolation between ecologically similar species of Louisiana Iris: Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva to determine the potential for adaptive introgression in nature. Line-cross analyses allowed us a general overview of the gene action responsible for fitness-related traits. We then used a QTL mapping approach to detect genomic regions responsible for variation in these traits. Although hybrid classes suffered reduced fitness for many traits, hybrid means were equivalent to at least one of the parental species in overall estimates of maternal and paternal fitness during the two years of the field study. The genetic architecture underlying the fitness-related traits varied across field site and year of the study, thus emphasizing the importance of the environment in determining the degree of postzygotic isolation and potential for introgression across natural hybrid zones.	2009	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00742.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Teng, Changcai; Niu, Yan; Du, Dezhi; Yu, Qinglan; Zhao, Zhigang	Production and genetic analyses of novel Brassica rapa L. introgressions from interspecific crosses with Brassica juncea L. landraces native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	EUPHYTICA	Interspecific hybrids between related species have long been used for transferring desirable genes, broadening genetic diversity and utilizing intersubgenomic heterosis. In this study, we developed a novel Brassica rapa type (AA, 2n = 20) exhibiting certain features derived from interspecific hybridization between natural B. rapa and Brassica juncea (AABB, 2n = 36). In pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the novel B. rapa type, normal chromosome pairing with 10 bivalents and 10: 10 segregation was observed, and the novel B. rapa lines were completely fertile. However, GISH showed that certain B chromosomes or fragments were introgressed into B. rapa. Genetic components of the novel B. rapa lines were investigated by GISH, AFLP and SSR analyses. GISH analysis of F-1, BC1F1, and BC1F2 plants confirmed the identities of three addition lines and seven translocation lines. AFLP and SSR analyses of 60 hybrid progenies from BC1F4 plants, their parents, and some B. juncea and B. rapa resources indicated that the A(J) and B chromosome(s) or fragment(s) introgressed to the novel B. rapa. AFLP revealed that 60 BC1F4 plants contained B chromosomes or fragments, which evidenced introgression into the hybrid progeny. SSR analysis indicated that the A-genome (A1-A10) of B. juncea was introgressed into the hybrid progeny at 1.0 to 42.7%. Lastly, we obtained some yellow-seed and early-flowering B. rapa resources. The novel B. rapa lines can be used to genetically improve B. rapa in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and to study the origin and evolution of the A- and B-genomes.	2018	10.1007/s10681-018-2108-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Tian, Entang; Roslinsky, Vicky; Cheng, Bifang	Molecular marker-assisted breeding for improved Ogura cms restorer line (RfoRfo) and mapping of the restorer gene (Rfo) in Brassica juncea	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Developing a fully functional hybrid system is a must for hybrid breeding in Brassica juncea. The B. napus Ogura cms hybrid system was transferred into B. juncea by the researchers at INRA, France. The B. juncea restorer (R) line (RfoRfo) exhibited poor vigor, low fertility and was black-seeded due to linkage drag. Our studies indicated that the Rfo gene in B. juncea R line was linked to the 5 C9 markers of B. napus (sN3553F, sS2285, sN3841, sN12905 and At5g58730) and 4 radish markers (At3g27100, At5g25080, At4g13720 and At5g06240) in addition to the 6 radish markers reported before (ScH03, ScA14, OPF3, BolJon, CAB and PGIint). These markers were used to screen for improved restorer plants in the three crosses of B. juncea restorer plant O39-16 (Rforf) x condiment var. Cutlass, O39-16 (Rforf) x canola B. juncea line C668 and O39-16 (Rforf) x resynthesized B. juncea line 15043. One improved homozygous R line VR441 (RfoRfo) with only 1 C9 marker sN12905 and 2 radish markers ScH03 and BolJon was successfully developed via marker-assisted selection in the cross O39-16 x 15043. VR441 had good seed-setting (average: 14.3 seeds/pod), strong growth vigor and was yellow-seeded. Linkage mapping revealed that the Rfo gene was introgressed into chromosome 9 of the A genome in B. juncea. The development of the improved R line VR441 has made the Ogura cms hybrid system fully functional in B. juncea. We are currently using the improved system for developing high yielding hybrid varieties in condiment and canola B. juncea.	2014	10.1007/s11032-014-0121-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

An increase in unsaturated FAs content or iodine value (IV) as a measure of the degree of unsaturation would help to open up new markets for the oil. One way to manipulate the fatty acid composition (FAC) in palm oil is through introgression of favourable alleles from the American oil palm, E. oleifera, which has a more unsaturated oil. Results: In this study, a segregating E. oleifera x E. guineensis (OxG) hybrid population for FAC is used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to IV and various FAs. QTL analysis revealed 10 major and two putative QTLs for IV and six FAs, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1 and C18:2 distributed across six linkage groups (LGs), OT1, T2, T3, OT4, OT6 and T9. The major QTLs for IV and C16:0 on LGOT1 explained 60.0 69.0 % of the phenotypic trait variation and were validated in two independent BC2 populations. The genomic interval contains several key structural genes in the FA and oil biosynthesis pathways such as PATE/FATB, HIBCH, BASS2, LACS4 and DGAT1 and also a relevant transcription factor (TF), WRI1. The literature suggests that some of these genes can exhibit pleiotropic effects in the regulatory networks of these traits. Using the whole genome sequence data, markers tightly linked to the candidate genes were also developed. Clustering trait values according to the allelic forms of these candidate markers revealed significant differences in the IV and FAs of the palms in the mapping and validation crosses. Conclusions: The candidate gene approach described and exploited here is useful to identify the potential causal genes linked to FAC and can be adopted for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in oil palm.	2016	10.1186/s12864-016-2607-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Tiwari, Jagesh K.; Chandel, Poonam; Singh, Bir Pal; Bhardwaj, Vinay	Analysis of plastome and chondriome genome types in potato somatic hybrids from Solanum tuberosum x Solanum etuberosum	GENOME	Cytoplasm types of the potato somatic hybrids from Solanum tuberosum x Solanum etuberosum were analysed using chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) organelle genomes-specific markers. Of the 29 markers (15 cpDNA and 14 mtDNA) amplified in the 26 genotypes, 5 cpDNA (H3, NTCP4, NTCP8, NTCP9, and ALC1/ALC3) and 13 mtDNA markers showed polymorphism. The cluster analysis based on the mtDNA markers detected higher diversity compared with the cpDNA markers. Presence of new mtDNA fragments of the markers, namely, T11-2, Nsm1, pumD, Nsm3, and Nsm4, were observed, while monomorphic loci revealed highly conserved genomic regions in the somatic hybrids. The study revealed that the somatic hybrids had diverse cytoplasm types consisting predominantly of T-, W-, and C-, with a few A-and S-type cp genomes; and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-type mt genomes. Somatic hybridization has unique potential to widen the cytoplasm types of the cultivated gene pools from wild species through introgression by breeding methods.	2014	10.1139/gen-2013-0122		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

Substitutions of 2S and 7U chromosomes of Aegilops kotschyi in wheat enhance grain iron and zinc concentration	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Biofortification through genetic manipulation is the best approach for improving micronutrient content of the staple food crops to alleviate hidden hunger, namely, the deficiency of Fe and Zn affecting more than two billion people worldwide. An interspecific hybridization was made between T. aestivum line Chinese Spring (CS) and Aegilops kotschyi accession 3790 selected for high grain iron and zinc concentration. The CS x Ae. kotschyi F-1 hybrid with low chromosome pairing was highly male and female sterile. This was backcrossed with wheat cultivars to get seed set. The selfed BC1F1 and BC2F1 plants with high grain iron and zinc concentration were selected in subsequent generations. The selected derivatives showed 60-136% enhanced grain iron and zinc concentration and 50-120% increased iron and zinc content per seed as compared to the recipient wheat cultivars. Thirteen cytologically stable, fertile and agronomically superior plants with high grain iron and zinc concentrations were selected for molecular characterization. The application of anchored wheat SSR markers, transferable to Ae. kotschyi, to the high grain iron and zinc containing derivatives indicated introgression of group 2 and group 7 chromosomes of Ae. kotschyi. GISH and FISH analysis of some derivatives confirmed the substitution of chromosomes 2S and 7U for their homoeologues of the A genome, suggesting that some of the genes controlling high grain micronutrient content in the Ae. kotschyi accession are on these chromosomes.	2010	10.1007/s00122-010-1307-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Toyomoto, Daiki; Uemura, Masato; Taura, Satoru; Sato, Tadashi; Henry, Robert; Ishikawa, Ryuji; Ichitani, Katsuyuki	Segregation Distortion Observed in the Progeny of Crosses Between Oryza sativa and O. meridionalis Caused by Abortion During Seed Development	PLANTS-BASEL	Wild rice relatives having the same AA genome as domesticated rice (Oryza sativa) comprise the primary gene pool for rice genetic improvement. Among them, O. meridionalis and O. rufipogon are found in the northern part of Australia. Three Australian wild rice strains, Jpn1 (O. rufipogon), Jpn2, and W1297 (O. meridionalis), and one cultivated rice cultivar Taichung 65 (T65) were used in this study. A recurrent backcrossing strategy was adopted to produce chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs) carrying chromosomal segments from wild relatives and used for trait evaluation and genetic analysis. The segregation of the DNA marker RM136 locus on chromosome 6 was found to be highly distorted, and a recessive lethal gene causing abortion at the seed developmental stage was shown to be located between two DNA markers, KGC6_10.09 and KGC6_22.19 on chromosome 6 of W1297. We name this gene as SEED DEVELOPMENT 1 (gene symbol: SDV1). O. sativa is thought to share the functional dominant allele Sdv1-s (s for sativa), and O. meridionalis is thought to share the recessive abortive allele sdv1-m (m for meridionalis). Though carrying the sdv1-m allele, the O. meridionalis accessions can self-fertilize and bear seeds. We speculate that the SDV1 gene may have been duplicated before the divergence between O. meridionalis and the other AA genome Oryza species, and that O. meridionalis has lost the function of the SDV1 gene and has kept the function of another putative gene named SDV2.	2019	10.3390/plants8100398		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines/manipulated crosses	FALSE			FALSE

Genetic regulation of glucoraphanin accumulation in Beneforte (R) broccoli	NEW PHYTOLOGIST	Diets rich in broccoli (Brassica oleracea var italica) have been associated with maintenance of cardiovascular health and reduction in risk of cancer. These health benefits have been attributed to glucoraphanin that specifically accumulates in broccoli. The development of broccoli with enhanced concentrations of glucoraphanin may deliver greater health benefits. Three high-glucoraphanin F1 broccoli hybrids were developed in independent programmes through genome introgression from the wild species Brassica villosa. Glucoraphanin and other metabolites were quantified in experimental field trials. Global SNP analyses quantified the differential extent of B.villosa introgression The high-glucoraphanin broccoli hybrids contained 2.53 times the glucoraphanin content of standard hybrids due to enhanced sulphate assimilation and modifications in sulphur partitioning between sulphur-containing metabolites. All of the high-glucoraphanin hybrids possessed an introgressed B.villosa segment which contained a B.villosa Myb28 allele. Myb28 expression was increased in all of the high-glucoraphanin hybrids. Two high-glucoraphanin hybrids have been commercialised as Beneforte (R) broccoli. The study illustrates the translation of research on glucosinolate genetics from Arabidopsis to broccoli, the use of wild Brassica species to develop cultivars with potential consumer benefits, and the development of cultivars with contrasting concentrations of glucoraphanin for use in blinded human intervention studies.	2013	10.1111/nph.12232		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Genome polymorphism of the synthetic species xTrititrigia cziczinii Tsvel. inferred from AFLP analysis	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII	xTrititrigia cziczinii Tsvel. is a synthetic species obtained as a result of hybridization of different wheat and wheat-grass species. xT. cziczinii has unique characteristics, as it is a perennial species, with the ability to grow after mowing, high adaptability, resistance to diseases and pests, high protein and gluten content in the grain. All this makes it a promising new crop for agriculture. The new species is a good object for fundamental research in the field of genetics, phylogeny and evolution of cereals (Poaceae). However, there were practically no genetic studies of xT. cziczinii. The aim of this work was to study the genetic diversity of 24 representatives of two xT. cziczinii subspecies (ssp. Submitans and ssp. Perenne). To estimate interspecific differences, 17 samples of other tribe Triticeae species (Triticum aestivum, Triticum durum, Agropyron glaucum and Agropyron elon-gatum, as well as samples of Triticum-Agropyron and Triticum-Elymus hybrids) were included in the analysis. For the study, AFLP method (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) was chosen, which allowed us to reveal a sufficiently high polymorphism level of the studied samples. The two primer/enzyme combinations (EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CCC, EcoRI-ACT/MseI-CTA) allowed the identification of 227 fragments, 224 of them were polymorphic (98.68 %), and the level of intraspecific polymorphism of 24 xT. cziczinii samples was 68.15 %. The identified fragments of AFLP spectra, specific for the xT. cziczinii representatives and the studied wheat-grass species, can be the basis for creating markers that will detect introgressions of genetic material of the genus Agropyron in the T. cziczinii genome. Our results indicate a greater genetic relatedness of xT. cziczinii to T. aestivum than to representatives of the genus Agropyron. According to the cluster analysis, representatives of xT. cziczinii and varieties of bread wheat were combined into a single subcluster, within which the samples of two species form separate groups. At the same time, the evaluation of the intraspecific genetic diversity of xT. cziczinii showed no reliable differentiation of representatives of the subspecies Submitans and Perenne, which is probably due to uncertain genetic nature of perenniality, the main feature that divides these subspecies. The study of the unique xT. cziczinii collection allowed us to obtain the first data on the genetics of the species, while previous studies were focused mainly on phenotypic and economically valuable traits. AFLP analysis used in this study showed high efficiency when working with less studied species, and its results are promising and useful for understanding the genetic structure of the new species (xT. cziczinii Tsvel.).	2018	10.18699/VJ18.406		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	synthetic species, use AFLPs, text is also in Russian	FALSE			FALSE	
Trucco, F; Tatum, T; Rayburn, AL; Tranel, PJ	Fertility, segregation at a herbicide-resistance locus, and genome structure in BC1 hybrids from two important weedy Amaranthus species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Field studies have established high potential for hybridization between two important and often coexisting weedy species, Amaranthus hybridus and Amaranthus tuberculatus. Prezygotic reproductive barriers between these species are believed to be limited to pollen competition and availability. A greenhouse study showed that a herbicide-resistance gene (ALS) from A. hybridus could be introgressed into an advanced A. tuberculatus background (BC2). However, evidence is lacking in support of such transfer in nature. Postzygotic reproductive barriers may minimize, if not preclude, natural introgression. Indeed, A. hybridus xA. tuberculatus hybrids are characterized by reduced fertility and even floral neuterism. The purpose of this study was to assess hybrid fertility in the BC1 generation and its relationship with genome structure and segregation at ALS. Fertility was assessed by measuring seed output and by pollen evaluation, and segregation at ALS was determined via a molecular marker system. The two parental species have the same ploidy (2n = 32) but differ in DNA content (2C) values, with A. tuberculatus chromosomes being on average 29% greater than those of A. hybridus. Given that most (98%) BC(1)s were homoploid, 2C values were used as indicators of relative genomic constitution. Fertility in the BC1 generation was greater than that of F(1)s, and 3% of BC(1)s had seed output similar to that of the parental species. Fertility in the BC1 did not correlate (in a strict way) with reconstitution of parental genomes. Hybrid sterility appeared to be controlled by relatively few loci. Heterozygosity at ALS was negatively correlated with fertility. Also, the A. tuberculatus ALS allele was not observed in the A. hybridus sexual condition, monoecism. Linkage of ALS to a locus associated (directly or via epistasis) with hybrid sterility may explain the fertility penalty observed with ALS introgression. Moreover, this linkage might explain why sequenced herbicide-resistance ALS alleles from sympatric A. tuberculatus and A. hybridus populations show independent evolution.	2005	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02581.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Tsuda, Mai; Okuzaki, Ayako; Kaneko, Yukio; Tabei, Yutaka	Persistent C genome chromosome regions identified by SSR analysis in backcross progenies between Brassica juncea and B. napus	BREEDING SCIENCE	Given that feral transgenic canola (Brassica napus) from spilled seeds has been found outside of farmer's fields and that B. juncea is distributed worldwide, it is possible that introgression to B. juncea from B. napus has occurred. To investigate such introgression, we characterized the persistence of B. napus C genome chromosome (C-chromosome) regions in backcross progenies by B. napus C-chromosome specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. We produced backcross progenies from B. juncea and F-1 hybrid of B. juncea x B. napus to evaluate persistence of C-chromosome region, and screened 83 markers from a set of reported C-chromosome specific SSR markers. Eighty-five percent of the SSR markers were deleted in the BC1 obtained from B. juncea x F-1 hybrid, and this BC1 exhibited a plant type like that of B. juncea. Most markers were deleted in BC2 and BC3 plants, with only two markers persisting in the BC3. These results indicate a small possibility of persistence of C-chromosome regions in our backcross progenies. Knowledge about the persistence of B. napus C-chromosome regions in backcross progenies may contribute to shed light on gene introgression.	2012	10.1270/jsbbs.62.328		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Tu, Yuan-Kai; Chen, Han-Wei; Tseng, Kuang-Yu; Lin, Yen-Chun; Kuo, Bo-Jein	Morphological and genetic characteristics of F-1 hybrids introgressed from Brassica napus to B. rapa in Taiwan	BOTANICAL STUDIES	Background Unintentional introgression from genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape (Brassica napus) to a relative is inevitable in the open field. A feasible and practical strategy for restricting the spread of GM offspring is to set a reasonable isolated distance between GM B. napus and the relatives. To define the isolated distance, a pollen donor/recipient pair is a prerequisite to conducting the field trial of pollen flow. However, because the cultivation of GM B. napus is prohibited in Taiwan, it is difficult to obtain relevant information. Thus, this study explored the morphological and genetic characteristics of five varieties of B. napus (donor), three varieties of B. rapa (recipient), and the 15 corresponding F-1 hybrids, aiming to construct phenotypic data and genetic variation data and to select the most appropriate pollen donor/recipient for future field trials of pollen flow. Results The genome size of all F-1 hybrids estimated using flow cytometry showed intermediate DNA content between B. napus and B. rapa varieties. Most of the F-1 hybrids had intermediate plant height and blooming period, and the rosette leaves type and colors resembled those of B. napus varieties. The results of sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) showed an average of 9.52 bands per primer combination and 67.87 polymorphic bands among the F-1 hybrid population. Similarity and cluster analyses revealed higher similarity between F-1 hybrids and B. napus varieties than between F-1 hybrids and B. rapa varieties. Furthermore, we identified a specific 1100-bp band (LOC106302894) in F-1 hybrids and B. napus varieties but not in B. rapa varieties. Conclusions The rosette leaves and the DNA marker LOC106302894 observed in F-1 hybrids are consistent phenotypic and genetic characteristics that can be used to identify the presence of unintentional hybridization from B. napus to B. rapa in Taiwan. Due to the prohibition of GM crop cultivation, the hybridization system of non-GM Brassica species in this study can be utilized as a mimic scheme to conduct pollen flow trials, thus facilitating the determination of the proper isolated distance.	2020	10.1186/s40529-019-0279-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Tuerkoesi, Edina; Farkas, Andras; Aranyi, Nikolett Reka; Hoffmann, Borbala; Toth, Viola; Molnar-Lang, Marta	Improvement of the agronomic traits of a wheat-barley centric fusion by introgressing the 3HS.3BL translocation into a modern wheat cultivar	GENOME	The 3HS.3BL spontaneous Robertsonian translocation obtained from the progenies of wheat-barley (Chinese Spring x Betzes) hybrids backcrossed with wheat line Mv9kr1 was transferred into the modern Martonvasar wheat cultivar Mv Bodri. The translocation was identified with molecular cytogenetic methods. The inheritance of the translocation was traced using genomic in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using barley subtelomeric (HvT01) and centromere-specific [(AGGGAG) 4] repetitive DNA probes confirmed that the complete barley chromosome arm was involved in the Robertsonian translocation. The wheat-specific repetitive DNA probes identified the presence of the whole wheat genome, except the short arm of the 3B chromosome. Genotypes homozygous for the centric fusion were selected, after which morphological analysis was performed on the plants and the yield components were measured in the field during two consecutive vegetative seasons. The introgression of the 3HS.3BL translocation into the modern wheat cultivar Mv Bodri significantly reduced the plant height due to the incorporation of the dwarfing allele RhtD1b. The presence of the 3HS.3BL translocation in the Mv9kr1 and Mv Bodri wheat background improved tillering and seeds per plant productivity in field experiments carried out in Martonvasar and Keszthely, Hungary.	2014	10.1139/gen-2014-0187		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Turkosi, Edina; Cseh, Andras; Darko, Eva; Molnar-Lang, Marta	Addition of Manas barley chromosome arms to the hexaploid wheat genome	BMC GENETICS	Background: Cultivated barley belongs to the tertiary genepool of hexaploid wheat. Genes of interest can be transferred from barley into wheat through wide hybridization. The application of wheat-barley introgression lines could provide an excellent tool for the transfer of earliness, favourable amino acid composition, biotic stress resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, or good tillering ability into wheat. Results: A set of 10 wheat-barley ditelosomic addition lines (2HS, 2HL, 3HS, 3HL, 4HS, 4HL, 6HS, 6HL, 7HS and 7HL) was developed from the progenies of an Asakaze/Manas wheat-barley hybrid produced in Martonvasar, Hungary. The addition lines were selected from self-fertilized plants of the BC2F2-BC2F4 generations using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with repetitive DNA probes [HvT01, (GAA)(7) and centromere-specific (AGGGAG)(4) probes]. The cytogenetic identification was confirmed using barley arm-specific SSR and STS markers. The ditelosomic additions were propagated in the phytotron and in the field, and morphological parameters (plant height, tillering, length of the main spike, number of seeds/spike and seeds/plant, and spike characteristics) were described. In addition, the salt stress response of the ditelosomic additions was determined. Conclusions: The six-rowed winter barley cultivar Manas is much better adapted to Central European environmental conditions than the two-rowed spring barley Betzes previously used in wheat-barley crosses. The production of wheat-barley ditelosomic addition lines has a wide range of applications both for breeding (transfer of useful genes to the recipient species) and for basic research (mapping of barley genes, genetic and evolutionary studies and heterologous expression of barley genes in the wheat background).	2016	10.1186/s12863-016-0393-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

X.; Ordas, Bernardo; Pausch, Hubert; Tellier, Aurelien; Bauer, Eva; Schoen, Chris-Carolin	A comprehensive study of the genomic differentiation between temperate Dent and Flint maize	GENOME BIOLOGY	Background: Dent and Flint represent two major germplasm pools exploited in maize breeding. Several traits differentiate the two pools, like cold tolerance, early vigor, and flowering time. A comparative investigation of their genomic architecture relevant for quantitative trait expression has not been reported so far. Understanding the genomic differences between germplasm pools may contribute to a better understanding of the complementarity in heterotic patterns exploited in hybrid breeding and of mechanisms involved in adaptation to different environments. Results: We perform whole-genome screens for signatures of selection specific to temperate Dent and Flint maize by comparing high-density genotyping data of 70 American and European Dent and 66 European Flint inbred lines. We find 2.2 % and 1.4 % of the genes are under selective pressure, respectively, and identify candidate genes associated with agronomic traits known to differ between the two pools. Taking flowering time as an example for the differentiation between Dent and Flint, we investigate candidate genes involved in the flowering network by phenotypic analyses in a Dent-Flint introgression library and find that the Flint haplotypes of the candidates promote earlier flowering. Within the flowering network, the majority of Flint candidates are associated with endogenous pathways in contrast to Dent candidate genes, which are mainly involved in response to environmental factors like light and photoperiod. The diversity patterns of the candidates in a unique panel of more than 900 individuals from 38 European landraces indicate a major contribution of landraces from France, Germany, and Spain to the candidate gene diversity of the Flint elite lines. Conclusions: In this study, we report the investigation of pool-specific differences between temperate Dent and Flint on a genome-wide scale. The identified candidate genes represent a promising source for the functional investigation of pool-specific haplotypes in different genetic backgrounds and for the evaluation of their potential for future crop improvement like the adaptation to specific environments.	2016	10.1186/s13059-016-1009-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Usman, Magaji G.; Rafii, Mohd Y.; Martini, Mohammad Y.; Yusuff, Oladosu A.; Ismail, Mohd R.; Miah, Gous	Introgression of heat shock protein (Hsp70 and sHsp) genes into the Malaysian elite chilli variety Kulai (Capsicum annuum L.) through the application of marker-assisted backcrossing (MAB)	CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES	Backcrossing together with simple sequence repeat marker strategy was adopted to improve popular Malaysian chilli Kulai (Capsicum annuum L.) for heat tolerance. The use of molecular markers in backcross breeding and selection contributes significantly to overcoming the main drawbacks such as increase linkage drag and time consumption, in the ancient manual breeding approach (conventional), and speeds up the genome recovery of the recurrent parent. The strategy was adopted to introgress heat shock protein gene(s) from AVPP0702 (C. annuum L.), which are heat-tolerant, into the genetic profile of Kulai, a popular high-yielding chilli but which is heat sensitive. The parents were grown on seed trays, and parental screening was carried out with 252 simple sequence repeat markers. The selected parents were crossed and backcrossed to generate F-1 hybrids and backcross generations. Sixty-eight markers appeared to be polymorphic and were used to assess the backcross generation; BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC3F1. The average recipient allele of the selected four BC1F1 plants was 80.75% which were used to produce the BC2F1 generation. BC1-P-7 was the best BC1F1 plant because it had the highest recovery at 83.40% and was positive to Hsp-linked markers (Hsp70-u2 and AGi42). After three successive generations of backcrossing, the average genome recovery of the recurrent parent in the selected plants in BC3F1 was 95.37%. Hsp gene expression analysis was carried out on BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC3F1 selected lines. The Hsp genes were found to be up-regulated when exposed to heat treatment. The pattern of Hsp expression in the backcross generations was similar to that of the donor parent. This confirms the successful introgression of a stress-responsive gene (Hsp) into a Kulai chilli pepper variety. Furthermore, the yield performance viz. plant height, number of fruits, fruit length and weight and total yield of the improved plant were similar with the recurrent parent except that the plant height was significantly lower than the Kulai (recurrent) parent.	2018	10.1007/s12192-017-0836-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

F.; van de Wiel, Clemens C. M.	Crop to wild introgression in lettuce: following the fate of crop genome segments in backcross populations	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: After crop-wild hybridization, some of the crop genomic segments may become established in wild populations through selfing of the hybrids or through backcrosses to the wild parent. This constitutes a possible route through which crop (trans) genes could become established in natural populations. The likelihood of introgression of transgenes will not only be determined by fitness effects from the transgene itself but also by the crop genes linked to it. Although lettuce is generally regarded as self-pollinating, outbreeding does occur at a low frequency. Backcrossing to wild lettuce is a likely pathway to introgression along with selfing, due to the high frequency of wild individuals relative to the rarely occurring crop-wild hybrids. To test the effect of backcrossing on the vigour of inter-specific hybrids, Lactuca serriola, the closest wild relative of cultivated lettuce, was crossed with L. sativa and the F-1 hybrid was backcrossed to L. serriola to generate BC1 and BC2 populations. Experiments were conducted on progeny from selfed plants of the backcrossing families (BC1S1 and BC2S1). Plant vigour of these two backcrossing populations was determined in the greenhouse under non-stress and abiotic stress conditions (salinity, drought, and nutrient deficiency). Results: Despite the decreasing contribution of crop genomic blocks in the backcross populations, the BC1S1 and BC2S1 hybrids were characterized by a substantial genetic variation under both non-stress and stress conditions. Hybrids were identified that performed equally or better than the wild genotypes, indicating that two backcrossing events did not eliminate the effect of the crop genomic segments that contributed to the vigour of the BC1 and BC2 hybrids. QTLs for plant vigour under non-stress and the various stress conditions were detected in the two populations with positive as well as negative effects from the crop. Conclusion: As it was shown that the crop contributed QTLs with either a positive or a negative effect on plant vigour, we hypothesize that genomic regions exist where transgenes could preferentially be located in order to mitigate their persistence in natural populations through genetic hitchhiking.	2012	10.1186/1471-2229-12-43		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression ,lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Valente, M. T.; Sabatini, E.; Casali, P. E.; Ferrari, L.; Falavigna, A.	Molecular Marker-Assisted Introgression of Wild Asparagus Species Genome into the Cultivated Asparagus officinalis L.	XII INTERNATIONAL ASPARAGUS SYMPOSIUM	Interspecific hybridization in Asparagus genus is expected to introgress desirable characteristics of wild species (good taste of spears, adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses) into the cultivated one (A. officinalis L). To this purpose two species spontaneous in the Mediterranean climate were considered: A. maritimus L. Miller, resistant to rust disease (Puccinia asparagi) and tolerant to salt; A. acutifolius L., adapted to xerophytic conditions. Besides both species are well known for good taste of their spears. To overcome the sexual incompatibility between A. officinalis and A. acutifolius a bridge-cross "A. officinalis (4n) x A. maritimus (4n)" was necessary. The "three-ways" interspecific hybrid plant obtained (OMA) was crossed to the tetraploide A. officinalis cultivar 'Violetto d'Albenga' and eight BC1 (OMAO) plants were generated. One of these plants gave nine dihaploid (DH) and seven tetraploid androgenetic clones following in vitro anther culture. Dihaploid plants crossed with diploid A. officinalis genotypes gave F-1 fertile plants (DO). The objective of this study was the assessment of genomic introgression of A. acutifolius and A. maritimus into progenies derived from backcross to A. officinalis by means of RAPD molecular markers. Results obtained showed that A. acutifolius genome was present in the OMA plant, but most of it was lost in the genotypes derived both from backcrosses with A. officinalis and anther culture. Moreover, the genome introgression of A. maritimus was not demonstrated because none of the markers used discriminated this species from A. officinalis.	2012			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	IL	FALSE			FALSE	
van de Wiel, C; Groot, M; den Nijs, H	Gene flow from crops to wild plants and its populationecological consequences in the context of GM-crop biosafety, including some recent experiences from lettuce	ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND BENEFITS OF TRANSGENIC CROPS	The public concern about the impact of genetically modified crops on the natural environment triggered a steady stream of research during the last decade. Among the possible impacts, the 'escape' of the transgene, either through dispersal of the crop plant outside the agricultural area or through hybridization with wild relatives, attracted a lot of attention, in particular in relation to the possibility of increasing 'weediness'. For gene flow through hybridization to occur, pollen grains must achieve fertilization and seeds must germinate and produce sexually mature plants. Subsequently, the first generation hybrids should be sufficiently fit to survive to sexual maturity and thus produce follow-up generations by which actual introgression into wild acceptor-species genomes could occur through repeated backcrossing. All these steps are reviewed in this paper. It will become evident that, in order to estimate a transgene's capacity to introgress and persist in wild relatives, all steps in the introgression process should be considered. Areas where still relatively little definite data has been published are i) assessing the extent to which genes, such as those conferring resistance to biotic as well as abiotic stresses, indeed enhance fitness in natural settings and the consequences of introgression of these for these environments; and ii) improving this assessment of fitness, e.g. by not only scoring relevant traits, such as those related to fecundity, but also monitoring them in realistic field situations. In this regard, more data on, for instance, the effects of the transgene insertion site on the introgression process and the importance of fitness of the intermediate stages (backcrosses) would be needed to reach a more general insight. In relation to co-existence of GMO and organic agriculture, crop-to-crop gene flow also needs to be controlled. Therefore, a wide variety of possible hybridization barriers, both physical and biological, are discussed. The technical limitations of assessing introgression from crop to wild avoiding the use of transgenic markers are discussed on the basis of work on lettuce.	2005			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	book chapter	FALSE			FALSE	
Van Laere, K.; Khrustaleva, L.; Van Huylenbroeck, J.; Van Bockstaele, E.	Application of GISH to characterize woody ornamental hybrids with small genomes and chromosomes	PLANT BREEDING	P>Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) is a powerful tool in distinguishing parental genomes in plant hybrids. However, in plants with small genome GISH often failed to decorate entire chromosomes. In this study, the GISH technology was adapted for woody ornamentals, commonly characterized by small genomes (between 842.8 and 2430.4 Mbp/1C or 0.86 and 2.48 pg/1C) and/or high amounts of small chromosomes (up to 82 chromosomes with size 1.4-4.8 mu m). The used GISH method was successful to label entire chromosomes by using an optimal probe/block ratio (> 1/80) and the best probe labelling and detection system (biotin vs. digoxigenin). GISH was performed on Buddleja and Hibiscus hybrids resulting from an interspecific breeding programme. For the first time, GISH on Buddleja x weyeriana'Sungold' (F2 of B. globosa x B. davidii) showed a chromosomal origin of the hybrid: 36 chromosomes inherited from B. davidii (2n = 2x = 76), 28 chromosomes from B. globosa (2n = 2x = 38) and 12 chromosomes were recombinant chromosomes between B. globosa and B. davidii. The detected chromosome constitution in B. x weyeriana points on 2n-gametes formation during meiosis of B. globosa. GISH analysis of F1 and F2 hybrids of B. davidiixB. x weyeriana crosses revealed that 16 (F1) and 10 (F2) chromosomes completely belong to B. davidii and all the other chromosomes were recombinant. This proved that all chromatin material of B. globosa was introgressed into the B. davidii chromosomes. GISH analysis of an F1 hybrid between Hibiscus syriacus x H. paramutabilis revealed 40 chromosomes of H. syriacus (2n = 4x = 80) and 41 chromosomes of H. paramutabilis (2n = 4x = 82). In an F2 hybrid of H. syriacus xH. paramutabilis 25 recombinant chromosomes were detected, indicating introgression of H. syriacus DNA in H. paramutabilis.	2010	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01692.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Introgression of yellow flower colour in Buddleja davidii by means of polyploidisation and interspecific hybridisation	HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE	VAN LAERE K., VAN HUYLENBROECK J., VAN BOCKSTAELE E., 2011. Introgression of yellow flower colour in Buddleja davidii by means of polyploidisation and interspecific hybridisation. Hort. Sci. (Prague), 38: 96-103. To introduce yellow colour in the commercial Buddleja davidii (2n = 4x = 76) assortment, an interspecific breeding programme with B. globosa (2n = 2x = 38) was started. The first step was to perform chromosome doubling in B. globosa. Two of the obtained tetraploid B. globosa plants were subsequently used as male parent in interspecific crosses with the white flowering B. davidii cv. Nanhoensis Alba. In total 182 interspecific crosses were made and 18 F1 hybrids were obtained. Genome size measurements, chromosome counts and genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) analysis proved the hybrid nature of most of the F1 hybrids. Plant morphology also expressed hybrid characteristics. F1 seedlings inherited the yellowish flower colour from B. globosa. As for many other woody ornamentals, the creation of hybrids through interspecific hybridisation along with polyploidisation offers new opportunities for breeding in Buddleja.	2011	10.17221/61/2011-HORTSCI		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Van Tuyl, Jaap M.; Arens, Paul; Shahin, Arwa; Marasek-Ciolakowska, Agnieszka; Barba-Gonzalez, Rodrigo; Kim, Hyoung Tae; Lim, Ki-Byung	Lilium	ORNAMENTAL CROPS	The genus Lilium consists of approximately 100 species that are distributed throughout the cold and temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It is subdivided into seven sections: Martagon, Pseudolirium, Lilium, Archelirion, Sinomartagon, Leucolirion, and Oxypetalum. The main species are described with their characteristics. The role of these species in the breeding of lilies is presented in an updated crossing polygon. Lily is a model crop for interspecific hybridization studies resulting in a range of techniques such as pollination methods to overcome inhibition of pollen tubes in the style, embryo rescue methods to prevent embryo abortion, and polyploidization methods to overcome F1 sterility. The use of meiotic and mitotic polyploidization for obtaining polyploids and the application of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) proved the importance of intergenomic recombination for introgression of characters. Molecular breeding has not been implemented in actual breeding yet. Progress is made in the development of markers for breeding of Lilium. Especially the development of massive parallel sequencing methods known as NGS sequencing and the availability of high-throughput marker systems resulted in new genetic maps of lily with markers closely linked to resistance genes (LMoV and Fusarium). During the last 50 years, lily has become worldwide one of the most important flower bulbs and cut flowers. They are mainly cultivated in the Netherlands with bulb production acreage of more than 5000 ha. The assortment of lilies consists of thousands of polyploid cultivars which can be classified in different established hybrid groups (Asiatic, LA, OT, OA, LO, Longiflorum, and Oriental). Recently the double-flowered lilies are a new development.	2018	10.1007/978-3-319-90698-0_20	10.1007/978-3-319-90698-0	Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Book; does not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE

Genomic in situ hybridization analysis of seed irradiation hybrid F-2 seedlings showed several terminal and interstitial signals indicated the introgression of Ae. kotschyi chromosome segments. This proves the efficacy of seed radiation hybrid approach in gene transfer experiments. All the radiation-treated hybrid plants with high grain Fe and Zn content were analyzed with wheat group 2 chromosome-specific polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers to identify the introgression of small alien chromosome fragment(s).Conclusion Radiation-induced hybrids showed more than 65% increase in grain iron and 54% increase in Zn contents with better harvest index than the elite wheat cultivar WL711 indicating effective and compensating translocations of 2S(k) fragments into wheat genome.	2016	10.3109/09553002.2016.1135263		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Vitova, Jana; Vit, Petr; Suda, Jan	Rare occurrence of reciprocal hybridization in a sympatric population of the Czech stenoendemic Dianthus arenarius subsp bohemicus and widespread D. carthusianorum	PRESLIA	Hybridization between rare and common plant congeners can pose a serious threat to the rare species through gene swamping, production of hybrid seed at the expense of conspecific seed and/or hybrid competition for abiotic or biotic resources. Assessing the frequency and dynamics of interspecific hybridization is therefore of paramount importance for conservation purposes. Here we investigate, using DNA flow cytometry, multivariate morphometrics and chloroplast DNA sequencing, the frequency and direction of interspecific hybridization between the critically endangered Czech endemic psammophyte Dianthus arenarius subsp. bohemicus and its sympatric congener D. carthusianorum (Caryophyllaceae) in a single population in central Bohemia. Flow cytometry allowed unambiguous identification of both parental species, based on differences in the amounts of nuclear DNA and revealed a few individuals (< 1.1% of the samples analysed) with intermediate genome sizes that corresponded to F1 hybrids. Clear discontinuities in estimated genome sizes and a low variation within recognized taxonomic groups make backcrossing to parental species or introgression unlikely. Interspecific hybrids were considerably less fertile, producing largely aborted pollen grains and no seed. Analysis of chloroplast haplotypes provided evidence for reciprocal hybridization (both species served as maternal and paternal parents). Length of the lowermost pair of cauline leaves, calyx length and petal length (incl. separate lengths of petal claw and petal limb) were taxonomically the most informative characters, allowing reliable identification of both parental species and their hybrids. The results indicate that interspecific hybridization has only a minor effect on the genetic integrity of the endemic D. arenarius subsp. bohemicus in its last remaining natural population. Nonetheless, we recommend periodic monitoring especially as the recent controlled large-scale disturbances (mechanical removal of the vegetation cover) in the locality may promote the establishment of interspecific crosses.	2015			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Waghmare, Vijay N.; Rong, Junkang; Rogers, Carl J.; Bowers, John E.; Chee, Peng W.; Gannaway, John R.; Katageri, Ishwarappa; Paterson, Andrew H.	Comparative transmission genetics of introgressed chromatin in Gossypium (cotton) polyploids	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Introgression is widely acknowledged as a potential source of valuable genetic variation, and growing effort is being invested in analysis of interspecifi ccrosses conferring transgressive variation. Experimental backcross populations provide an opportunity to study transmission genetics following interspecific hybridization, identifying opportunities and constraints to introgressive crop improvement. The evolutionary consequences of introgression have been addressed at the theoretical level, however, issues related to levels and patterns of introgression among (plant) species remain inadequately explored, including such factors as polyploidization, subgenome interaction inhabiting a common nucleus, and the genomic distribution and linkage relationships of introgressant alleles. METHODS: We analyze introgression into the polyploid Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) from its sister G. tomentosum and compare the level and pattern with that of G. barbadense representing a different clade tracing to the same polyploidization. KEY RESULTS: Across the genome, recurrent backcrossing to Gossypium hirsutum yielded only one-third of the expected average frequency of the G. tomentosum allele, although one unusual region showed preferential introgression. Although a similar rate of introgression is found in the two subgenomes of polyploid (AtDt) G. hirsutum, a preponderance of multilocus interactions were largely within the Dt subgenome. CONCLUSIONS: Skewed G. tomentosum chromatin transmission is polymorphic among two elite G. hirsutum genotypes, which suggests that genetic background may profoundly affect introgression of particular chromosomal regions. Only limited correspondence is found between G. hirsutum chromosomal regions that are intolerant to introgression from the two species, G. barbadense and G. tomentosum, concentrated near possible inversion polymorphisms. Complex transmission of introgressed chromatin highlights the challenges to utilization of exotic germplasm in crop improvement.	2016	10.3732/ajb.1500266		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Waminal, Nomar Espinosa; Kim, Hyun Hee	FISH Karyotype Analysis of Four Wild Cucurbitaceae Species Using 5S and 45S rDNA Probes and the Emergence of New Polyploids in Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim	KOREAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY	Wild relative species of domesticated crops are useful genetic resources for improving agronomic traits. Cytogenetic investigations based on chromosome composition provide insight into basic genetic and genomic characteristics of a species that can be exploited in a breeding program. Here, we used FISH analysis to characterize the ploidy level, chromosome constitution, and genomic distribution of SS and 45S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in four wild Cucurbitaceae species, namely, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Mansf. var. citroides L. H. Bailey (2n = 22), Melothria japonica Maxim. (2n = 22), Sicyos angulatus L. (2n = 24), and Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim. (2n = 66, 88, 110 cytotypes), collected in different areas of Korea. All species were diploids, except for T. kirilowii, which included hexa-, octa-, and decaploid cytotypes (2n = 6x = 66, 8x = 88, and 10x = 110). All species have small metaphase chromosomes in the range of 2-5 mu m. The 45S rDNA signals were localized distally compared to the 5S rDNA. C. lanatus var. citroides and M. japonica showed one and two loci of 45S and SS rDNA, respectively, with co-localization of rDNA signals in one M. japonica chromosome. S. angulatus showed two co-localized signals of SS and 45S rDNA loci. The hexaploid T. kirilowii cytotype showed five signals each for 45S and 5S rDNA, with three being co-localized. This is the first report of hexaploid and decaploid cytotypes in T kirilowii. These results will be useful in future Cucurbitaceae breeding programs.	2015	10.7235/hort.2015.15101		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wan, Zhengjie; Tan, Yuanbao; Shi, Minhui; Xu, Yuejin; Aryamanesh, Nader; Yan, Guijun	Interspecific introgression of male sterility from tetraploid oilseed Brassica napus to diploid vegetable B. rapa through hybridisation and backcrossing	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE	Interspecific F-1 hybrids were obtained from a cross between a male sterile Brassica napus (2n = 4x = 38, AA(20) and CC (18) genomes) and an inbreeding line B. rapa (Purple Cai-Tai inbred line 9418, 2n = 2x = 20, AA (20) genome) to introgress male sterility from a tetraploid into a diploid through backcrossing. The morphological characteristics of F-1 plants were more like the female parent B. napus and segregated considerably in BC1 when backcrossed to the recurrent parent Purple Cai-Tai. The progeny became stable and more similar to Purple Cai-Tai by BC4. Most C genome chromosomes were found to be eliminated, based on cytogenetic analysis. The majority of chromosomes were eliminated at very early backcross stages, with only 20-26 chromosomes in BC1 plants, and some chromosomes were eliminated gradually with increased backcross generations. The BC4 plants were generally stable with exactly 20 chromosomes. Analysis by AFLP indicated that 49.5-68.7% of the total bands eliminated from F-1 to BC4 were female parent specific, and similar to 12% of B. napus bands were retained with increased backcrossing. The genetic materials controlling sterility from the female parent B. napus were introgressed successfully into the BC4 plants even though most B. napus chromosomes/genetic materials were eliminated during the backcross process.	2013	10.1071/CP13103		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Aiyun; Zhang, Xianhua; Yang, Chunhua; Song, Zhaojian; Du, Chaoqun; Chen, Dongling; He, Yuchi; Cai, Detian	Development and characterization of synthetic amphiploid (AABB) between Oryza sativa and Oryza punctata	EUPHYTICA	Oryza punctata, a wild relative of cultivated rice, belongs to the BB genome of Oryza. Interspecific hybrids (CW008, AB) between Oryza sativa (2n = 24 AA) and O. punctata (2n = 24 BB) were obtained using embryo rescue technique. Synthetic allopolyploid (DCW008, AABB) were produced through chromosome doubling by colchicine. Hybrids overcame many wild traits except the shattering and awn. The synthetic amphiploid plants showed obvious superiority in growth and production. Interspecific hybrids CW008 were completely infertile but DCW008 had better seed set after selfing. Genomic in situ hybridization investigations were performed on DCW008. The result indicated that the A genome was closed to the B genome and translocations occurred between some chromosomes of cultivated and wild rice. Meiosis was nearly normal in the amphiploid hybrid but was disrupted in the diploid hybrid, which resulted in different fertility of them.	2013	10.1007/s10681-012-0821-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	synthetic lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Gui-xiang; Lv, Jing; Zhang, Jie; Han, Shuo; Zong, Mei; Guo, Ning; Zeng, Xing-ying; Zhang, Yue-yun; Wang, You-ping; Liu, Fan	Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of Brassica nigra Introgression Lines from Somatic Hybridization: A Resource for Cauliflower Improvement	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Broad phenotypic variations were obtained previously in derivatives from the asymmetric somatic hybridization of cauliflower "Korso" (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis, 2n = 18, CC genome) and black mustard "G1/1" (Brassica nigra, 2n = 16, BB genome). However, the mechanisms underlying these variations were unknown. In this study, 28 putative introgression lines (ILs) were pre-selected according to a series of morphological (leaf shape and color, plant height and branching, curd features, and flower traits) and physiological (black rot/club root resistance) characters. Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that these plants contained 18 chromosomes derived from "Korso." Molecular marker (65 simple sequence repeats and 77 amplified fragment length polymorphisms) analysis identified the presence of "G1/1" DNA segments (average 7.5%). Additionally, DNA profiling revealed many genetic and epigenetic differences among the ILs, including sequence alterations, deletions, and variation in patterns of cytosine methylation. The frequency of fragments lost (5.1%) was higher than presence of novel bands (1.4%), and the presence of fragments specific to Brassica carinata (BBCC 2n = 34) were common (average 15.5%). Methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis indicated that methylation changes were common and that hypermethylation (12.4%) was more frequent than hypomethylation (4.8%). Our results suggested that asymmetric somatic hybridization and alien DNA introgression induced genetic and epigenetic alterations. Thus, these ILs represent an important, novel germplasm resource for cauliflower improvement that can be mined for diverse traits of interest to breeders and researchers.	2016	10.3339/fpls.2016.01258		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Hong-Yan; Tian, Qin; Ma, Yi-Qiao; Wu, Ying; Miao, Gao-Jian; Ma, Yan; Cao, Dong-Hui; Wang, Xiao-Li; Lin, Chunjing; Pang, Jingsong; Liu, Bao	Transpositional reactivation of two LTR retrotransposons in rice-Zizania recombinant inbred lines (RILs)	HEREDITAS	Hybridization is prevalent in plants, which plays important roles in genome evolution. Apart from direct transfer and recombinatory generation of genetic variations by hybridization, de novo genetic instabilities can be induced by the process per se. One mechanism by which such de novo genetic variability can be generated by interspecific hybridization is transpositional reactivation of quiescent parental transposable elements (TEs) in the nascent hybrids. We have reported previously that introgressive hybridization between rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Zizania latifolia Griseb had induced rampant mobilization of three TEs, a copia-like LTR retrotransposon Tos17, a MITE mPing and a class II TE belonging to the hAT superfamily, Dart/nDart. In this study, we further found that two additional LTR retrotransposons, a gypsy-like (named RIRE2) and a copia-like (named Copia076), were also transpositionally reactivated in three recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from introgressive hybridization between rice and Z. latifolia. Novel bands of these two retroelements appeared in the RILs relative to their rice parental line (cv. Matsumae) in Southern blot, suggestive of retrotransposition, which was substantiated by transposon display (TD) and locus-specific PCR amplification for insertion sites. Both elements were found to be transcribed but at variable levels in the leaf tissue of the parental line and the RILs, suggesting that transcriptional control was probably not a mechanism for their transpositional activity in the RILs. Expression analysis of four genes adjacent to de novo insertions by Copia076 revealed marked difference in the transcript abundance for each of the genes between the RILs and their rice parental line, but the alterations in expression appeared unrelated with the retroelement insertions.	2010	10.1111/j.1601-5223.2010.02181.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE		FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Hongbo; Gao, Yi; Mao, Fangming; Xiong, Lizhong; Mou, Tongmin	Directional upgrading of brown planthopper resistance in an elite rice cultivar by precise introgression of two resistance genes using genomics-based breeding	PLANT SCIENCE	Brown planthopper (BPH) is a devastating pest that threatens the food security of rice-producing countries. At present, most cultivars planted in farmers' paddies lack effective BPH resistance, which constitutes a potential threat to rice yield. Moreover, developing BPH-resistant rice varieties using traditional breeding approaches is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unpredictable. In this study, we successfully enhanced BPH resistance of the elite rice cultivar Wushansimiao by introgressing the resistance genes BPH14 and BPH15 through positive selection, negative selection, and whole genome background selection. Through backcrossing, the introgression fragments were reduced to 428.3 kb for BPH14 and 413.1 kb for BPH15. Except for these two fragments, the residual genetic background of the selected near-isogenic lines (NILs) was nearly identical to that of the recurrent parent, with a genetic background recovery rate of 99.78%. As a result, the selected NILs exhibited much stronger BPH resistance at the seedling and adult stages compared to the recurrent parent. Moreover, field tests showed that grain yield, major agronomic traits, and grain quality of the five selected NILs were statistically indistinguishable from those of the recurrent parent. Our results provide an effective approach for directionally upgrading the target traits and will inform and facilitate rice breeding.	2019	10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.110211		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Hongbo; Ye, Shengtuo; Mou, Tongmin	Molecular Breeding of Rice Restorer Lines and Hybrids for Brown Planthopper (BPH) Resistance Using the Bph14 and Bph15 Genes	RICE	Background: The development of hybrid rice is a practical approach for increasing rice production. However, the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stal, causes severe yield loss of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and can threaten food security. Therefore, breeding hybrid rice resistant to BPH is the most effective and economical strategy to maintain high and stable production. Fortunately, numerous BPH resistance genes have been identified, and abundant linkage markers are available for molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding programs. Hence, we pyramided two BPH resistance genes, Bph14 and Bph15, into a susceptive CMS restorer line Huahui938 and its derived hybrids using MAS to improve the BPH resistance of hybrid rice. Results: Three near-isogenic lines (NILs) with pyramided Bph14 and Bph15 were obtained by molecular marker-assisted backcross (MAB) and phenotypic selection. The genomic components of these NILs were detected using the whole-genome SNP (Single nucleotide polymorphism) array, RICE6K, suggesting that the recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery of the NILs was 87.88, 87.70 and 86.62 %, respectively. BPH bioassays showed that the improved NILs and their derived hybrids carrying homozygous Bph14 and Bph15 were resistant to BPH. However, the hybrids with heterozygous Bph14 and Bph15 remained susceptible to BPH. The developed NILs showed no significant differences in major agronomic traits and rice qualities compared with the recurrent parent. Moreover, the improved hybrids derived from the NILs exhibited better agronomic performance and rice quality compared with the controls under natural field conditions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that it is essential to stack Bph14 and Bph15 into both the maternal and paternal parents for developing BPH-resistant hybrid rice varieties. The SNP array with abundant DNA markers is an efficient tool for analyzing the RPG recovery of progenies and can be used to monitor the donor segments in NILs, thus being extremely important for rice molecular breeding.	2016	10.1186/s12284-016-0126-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Hongyan; Chai, Yang; Chu, Xiucheng; Zhao, Yunyang; Wu, Ying; Zhao, Jihong; Ngezahayo, Frederic; Xu, Chunming; Liu, Bao	Molecular characterization of a rice mutator-phenotype derived from an incompatible cross-pollination reveals transgenerational mobilization of multiple transposable elements and extensive epigenetic instability	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Inter-specific hybridization occurs frequently in plants, which may induce genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids, allopolyploids and introgressants. It remains unclear however whether pollination by alien pollens of an incompatible species may impose a "biological stress" even in the absence of genome-merger or genetic introgression, whereby genetic and/or epigenetic instability of the maternal recipient genome might be provoked. Results: We report here the identification of a rice mutator-phenotype from a set of rice plants derived from a crossing experiment involving two remote and apparently incompatible species, Oryza sativa L. and Oenothera biennis L. The mutator-phenotype (named Tong211-LP) showed distinct alteration in several traits, with the most striking being substantially enlarged panicles. Expectably, gel-blotting by total genomic DNA of the pollen-donor showed no evidence for introgression. Characterization of Tong211-LP (S0) and its selfed progenies (S1) ruled out contamination (via seed or pollen) or polyploidy as a cause for its dramatic phenotypic changes, but revealed transgenerational mobilization of several previously characterized transposable elements (TEs), including a MITE (mPing), and three LTR retrotransposons (Osr7, Osr23 and Tos17). AFLP and MSAP fingerprinting revealed extensive, transgenerational alterations in cytosine methylation and to a less extent also genetic variation in Tong211-LP and its immediate progenies. mPing mobility was found to correlate with cytosine methylation alteration detected by MSAP but not with genetic variation detected by AFLP. Assay by q-RT-PCR of the steady-state transcript abundance of a set of genes encoding for the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, and small interference RNA (siRNA) pathway-related proteins showed that, relative to the rice parental line, heritable perturbation in expression of 12 out of the 13 genes occurred in the mutator-phenotype and its sefled progenies. Conclusion: Transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of altered cytosine methylation and its associated TE activity occurred in a rice mutator-phenotype produced by pollinating the rice stigma with pollens of O. biennis. Heritably perturbed homeostatic expression-state of genes involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely an underlying cause for the alien pollination-induced transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and which occurred apparently without entailing genome merger or genetic introgression.	2009	10.1186/1471-2229-9-63		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, J; Xiang, FN; Xia, GM	Agropyron elongatum chromatin localization on the wheat chromosomes in an introgression line	PLANTA	The introgressed small-chromosome segment of Agropyron elongatum (Host.) Neviski (Thinopyrum ponticum Podp.) in F-5 line II-1-3 of somatic hybrid between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and A. elongatum was localized by sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and karyotype data. Karyotype analysis offered basic data of arm ratios and relative lengths of 21 pairs of chromosomes in parent wheat Jinan177 and hybrid II-1-3. Using special high repetitive sequences pSc119.2 and pAs1 for FISH, the entire B- and D-genome chromosomes were detected. The FISH pattern of hybrid II-1-3 was the same as that of parent wheat. GISH using whole genomic DNA from A. elongatum as probe determined the alien chromatin. Sequential GISH and FISH, in combination with some of the karyotype data, localized the small chromosome segments of A. elongatum on the specific sites of wheat chromosomes 2AL, 1BL, 5BS, 1DL, 2DL and 6DS. FISH with probe OPF-03(1296) from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) detected E-genome chromatin of A. elongatum, which existed in all of the small chromosome segments introgressed. Microsatellite primers characteristic for the chromosome arms above were used to check the localization and reveal the genetic identity. These methods are complementary and provide comprehensive information about the genomic constitution of the hybrid. The relationship between hybrid traits and alien chromatin was discussed.	2005	10.1007/s00425-004-1443-y		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Jianping P.; Bughrara, Suleiman S.; Mian, Rouf M. A.; Saha, Malay C.; Sleper, David A.	Parental genome composition and genetic classifications of derivatives from intergeneric crosses of Festuca mairei and Lolium perenne	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Intergeneric hybridization between Festuca and Lolium has been a long-term goal of forage and turfgrass breeders to generate improved cultivars by combining stress tolerance of Festuca and rapid establishment of Lolium. However, wide-distance hybridizations usually result in the wild genome being eliminated from the hybrid due to incomplete chromosome pairing and crossovers. In this study, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to detect the parental genome composition of F-1 hybrids and backcross, generated from crosses between Festuca mairei St. Yves (Fm) and Lolium perenne L. (Lp). Each of the hybrids exhibited integration of Fm and Lp genomes with varying levels of Fm/Lp genome ratios. However, cluster and principle component analyses of the progeny consistently revealed four groups depending on the amount of genome introgression from both parents. The parental genome composition and classifications of intergeneric progeny would be useful for breeding material selection.	2009	10.1007/s11032-008-9236-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Jun; You, Hanli; Tian, Ju; Wang, Yongfu; Liu, Minghu; Duan, Wula	Abnormal meiotic chromosome behavior and gametic variation induced by intersectional hybridization in Populus L.	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	Abnormal meiotic chromosome behavior and pollen variation in two intersectional hybrids between Populus simonii Carr. (section Tacamahaca Spach) and Populus euphratica Oliv. (section Turanga Bge.) were investigated by the squashed technique and indirect immunofluorescence. Both hybrids produced abnormal flower buds characterized by a primary bud with an accessary bud at frequencies of 39.0 and 17.8 %, respectively. Chromosome pairing analysis at late diakinesis showed average configurations 20.31 I+7.04 II+1.42 III+0.04 IV in hybrid "Xhu-DK" and 19.18 I+7.16 II+1.45 III+0.04 IV in hybrid "Xhu-TL", indicating high divergence between their parent species. Meiotic abnormalities, including precocious chromosome migration, lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, and micronuclei, were observed at high frequency, resulting in imbalanced chromosome segregation and chromosome elimination and caused high gamete sterility. Some micronuclei triggered formation of minispindles in Metaphase II, which were responsible for the formation of microcytes. Fused and tripolar spindles in the second meiotic division developed into dyads and triads, respectively, leading to viable first meiotic division restitution (FDR) type unreduced pollen formation. However, Xhu-TL was completely sterile because the high frequency of precocious cytokinesis during the second division prevented unreduced pollen formation though spindle fusion. Xhu-DK produced 29.6 % viable pollen grains. The diameter of viable pollen ranged from 19.6 to 64.9 mu m, suggesting that Xhu-DK might be capable of producing unreduced pollen or pollen with a higher ploidy level. The strategy of using the distant hybrids for chromosome introgression and polyploidy breeding in Populus L. was considered.	2015	10.1007/s11295-015-0880-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Junfeng; Zhao, Cuizhu; Liu, Chang; Xia, Guangmin; Xiang, Fengning	Introgression of Swertia mussotii gene into Bupleurum scorzonerifolium via somatic hybridization	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: The wild herb Swertia mussotii is a source of the anti-hepatitis compounds swertiamarin, mangiferin and gentiopicroside. Its over-exploitation has raised the priority of producing these compounds heterologously. Somatic hybridization represents a novel approach for introgressing Swertia mussotii genes into a less endangered species. Results: Protoplasts derived from calli of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium and S. mussotii were fused to produce 194 putative hybrid cell lines, of which three (all derived from fusions where the S. mussotii protoplasts were pre-treated for 30 s with UV light) later differentiated into green plants. The hybridity of the calli was confirmed by a combination of isozyme, RAPD and chromosomal analysis. The hybrid calli genomes were predominantly B. scorzonerifolium. GISH analysis of mitotic chromosomes confirmed that the irradiation of donor protoplasts increased the frequency of chromosome elimination and fragmentation. RFLP analysis of organellar DNA revealed that mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA of both parents coexisted and recombined in some hybrid cell lines. Some of the hybrid calli contained SmG10H from donor, and produced swertiamarin, mangiferin and certain volatile compounds characteristic of S. mussotii. The expression of SmG10H (geraniol 10-hydroxylase) was associated with the heterologous accumulation of swertiamarin. Conclusions: Somatic hybrids between B. scorzonerifolium and S. mussotii were obtained, hybrids selected all contained introgressed nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA from S. mussotii; and some produced more mangiferin than the donor itself. The introgression of SmG10H was necessary for the accumulation of swertiamarin.	2011	10.1186/1471-2229-11-71		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, L.; Zhang, Z.; Wei, L.; Zhang, D.; Teng, F.; Tao, Y.; Zheng, Y.	The residual background genome from a donor within an improved line selected by marker-assisted selection: impact on phenotype and combining ability	PLANT BREEDING	A successful marker-assisted selection (MAS)-derived line should express new characteristics derived from the donor, and have a small number of donor chromosomal fragments. Different selection strategies can result in a different proportion of donor residual background within the improved line. The effects of the residual background on phenotype and combining ability mostly remain unknown. In this study, waxy (wx) and a restorer gene (Rf3) of S-type cytoplasm sterility were selected as a model for MAS breeding by three strategies, to develop MAS-derived lines with a different level of residual background. Three MAS-derived lines were successfully developed by introgression of the target gene. Furthermore, the genetic background, agriculturally important traits and combining ability of the three MAS-derived lines were assayed. The results suggested that the three MAS-derived lines retained 4-18% of the chromosomal fragment of the donor, respectively, and the residual background impacted on the phenotype of important traits and combining ability of MAS-derived lines. We also showed that whole genome background screening each backcross generation can accelerate recovery of the recurrent parent genome, phenotype and combining ability.	2009	10.1111/j.1439-0523.2008.01611.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE

In the present study, one of these lines, i.e., hybrid progeny 25-10-3, which matured about 10-14 days earlier than its wheat parent, was assessed using sequenced characterized amplified region (SCAR) analysis, EST-SSR and EST-STS molecular markers, and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). We found that this was a stable wheat-P. huashanica disomic addition line (2n = 44 = 22 II) and the results demonstrated that it was a 6Ns disomic chromosome addition line, but it exhibited many different features compared with previously characterized lines, i.e., a longer awn, early maturation, and no twin spikelets. It was considered to be an early-maturing variety based on the early stage of inflorescence initiation in field experiments and binocular microscope observations over three consecutive years. This characteristic was distinct, especially from the single ridge stage and double ridge stage until the glume stage. In addition, it had a higher photosynthesis rate and economic values than common wheat cv. 7182, i.e., more spikelets per spike, more florets per spikelet, more kernels per spike, and a higher thousand-grain weight. These results suggest that this material may comprise a genetic pool of beneficial genes or chromosome segments, which are suitable for introgression to improve the quality of common wheat.	2015	10.1371/journal.pone.0131841		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Lingzhi; Yang, Aifang; He, Chunmei; Qu, Mingli; Zhang, Juren	Creation of new maize germplasm using alien introgression from Zea mays ssp mexicana	EUPHYTICA	Zea mays ssp. mexicana, an annual wild relative of maize, has many desirable characteristics for maize improvement. To transfer alien genetic germplasm into maize background, F(1) hybrids were generated by using Z. mays ssp. mexicana as the female parent and cultivated maize inbred line Ye515 as the male parent. Alien introgression lines, with a large range of genetic diversity, were produced by backcross and successive self-pollinations. A number of alien introgression lines with the predominant traits of cultivated maize were selected. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) proved that small chromosome segments of Z. mays ssp. mexicana had been integrated into the maize genome. Some outstanding alien introgression lines were evaluated in performance trials which showed 54.6% hybrids had grain yield greater than that of hybrid check Yedan12 which possessed 50% Ye515 parentage, and 17.1, 9.9% hybrids had grain yield competitive or greater than those of Nongda108 and Zheng958, which were elite commercial hybrids in China, respectively. The results indicated that some of the introgression lines had excellent agronomic traits and combining ability for maize cultivar, and demonstrated that Z. mays ssp. mexicana was a valuable source for maize breeding, and could be used to broaden and enrich the maize germplasm.	2008	10.1007/s10681-008-9730-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Mengcheng; Ji, Yujie; Feng, Shiting; Liu, Chun; Xiao, Zhen; Wang, Xiaoping; Wang, Yanxia; Xia, Guangmin	The non-random patterns of genetic variation induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization in wheat	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY	Background: Asymmetric somatic hybridization is an efficient crop breeding approach by introducing several exogenous chromatin fragments, which leads to genomic shock and therefore induces genome-wide genetic variation. However, the fundamental question concerning the genetic variation such as whether it occurs randomly and suffers from selection pressure remains unknown. Results: Here, we explored this issue by comparing expressed sequence tags of a common wheat cultivar and its asymmetric somatic hybrid line. Both nucleotide substitutions and indels (insertions and deletions) had lower frequencies in coding sequences than in un-translated regions. The frequencies of nucleotide substitutions and indels were both comparable between chromosomes with and without introgressed fragments. Nucleotide substitutions distributed unevenly and were preferential to indel-flanking sequences, and the frequency of nucleotide substitutions at 5'-flanking sequences of indels was obviously higher in chromosomes with introgressed fragments than in those without exogenous fragment. Nucleotide substitutions and indels both had various frequencies among seven groups of allelic chromosomes, and the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions were strongly negatively correlative to those of indels. Among three sets of genomes, the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions and indels were both heterogeneous, and the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions exhibited drastically positive correlation to those of indels. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that the genetic variation induced by asymmetric somatic hybridization is attributed to both whole genomic shock and local chromosomal shock, which is a predetermined and non-random genetic event being closely associated with selection pressure. Asymmetric somatic hybrids provide a worthwhile model to further investigate the nature of genomic shock induced genetic variation.	2018	10.1186/s12870-018-1474-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Mengcheng; Liu, Chun; Xing, Tian; Wang, Yanxia; Xia, Guangmin	Asymmetric somatic hybridization induces point mutations and indels in wheat	BMC GENOMICS	Background: Allopolyploid genome needs wide structural variation to deal with genomic shock. The introgression line, generated via asymmetric somatic hybridization, is introgressed with a minimum of exogenous chromatin, which also leads to genomic shock to induce genetic variation. However, the extent of its genomic variation and its difference from allopolyploidies remains unknown. Methods: Here, we explored this issue using the bread wheat cultivar SR3, a derivative of an asymmetric somatic hybrid between the cultivar JN177 and an accession of tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum elongatum). The ESTs (expressed sequence taqs) were large-scale sequenced using the cDNA library constructed in each of SR3 and JN177. Point mutations and indels (insertions and deletions) of SR3 were calculated, and their difference from the genetic variation of bread wheat and its ancestors were compared, with aim to analyze the extent and pattern of sequence variation induced by somatic hybridization. Results: Both point mutations and indels (insertions and deletions) were frequently induced by somatic hybridization in the coding sequences. While the genomic shock caused by allopolyploidization tends to favor deletion over insertion, there was no evidence for such a preference following asymmetric somatic hybridization. The GC content of sequence adjacent to indel sites was also distinct from what has been observed in allopolyploids. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that asymmetric somatic hybridization induces high frequency of genetic variation in a manner partially different from allopolipoidization. Asymmetric somatic hybridization provides appropriate material to comprehensively explore the nature of the genetic variation induced by genomic shock.	2015	10.1186/s12864-015-1974-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, YM; Dong, ZY; Zhang, ZJ; Lin, XY; Shen, Y; Zhou, DW; Liu, B	Extensive de novo genomic variation in rice induced by introgression from wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.)	GENETICS	To study the possible impact of alien introgression on a recipient plant genome, we examined >6000 unbiased genomic loci of three stable rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from intergeneric hybridization between rice (cv. Matsumae) and a wild relative (Zizania latifolia Griseb.) followed by successive selfing. Results from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis showed that, whereas the introgressed Zizania DNA comprised <0.1 % of the genome content in the RILs, extensive and genome-wide de novo variations occurred in up to 30 % of the analyzed loci for all three lines studied. The AFLP-detected changes were validated by DNA gel-blot hybridization and/or sequence analysis of genomic loci corresponding to a subset of the differentiating AFLP fragments. A BLAST analysis revealed that the genomic variations occurred in diverse sequences, including protein-coding genes, transposable elements, and sequences of unknown functions. Pairwise sequence comparison of selected loci between a RIL and its rice parent showed that the variations represented either base substitutions or small insertion/deletions. Genome variations were detected in all 12 rice chromosomes, although their distribution was uneven both among and within chromosomes. Taken together, our results imply that even cryptic alien introgression can be highly mutagenic to a recipient plant genome.	2005	10.1534/genetics.105.040964		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wang, Zhen-Hui; Zhang, Di; Bai, Yan; Zhang, Yun-Hong; Liu, Ying; Wu, Ying; Lin, Xiu-Yun; Wen, Jia-Wei; Xu, Chun-Ming; Li, Lin-Feng; Liu, Bao	Genomewide Variation in an Introgression Line of Rice-Zizania Revealed by Whole-Genome re-Sequencing	PLOS ONE	Background: Hybridization between genetically diverged organisms is known as an important avenue that drives plant genome evolution. The possible outcomes of hybridization would be the occurrences of genetic instabilities in the resultant hybrids. It remained under-investigated however whether pollination by alien pollens of a closely related but sexually "incompatible" species could evoke genomic changes and to what extent it may result in phenotypic novelties in the derived progenies. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we have re-sequenced the genomes of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Matsumae and one of its derived introgressant RZ35 that was obtained from an introgressive hybridization between Matsumae and Zizania latifolia Griseb. in general, 131 millions 90 base pair (bp) paired-end reads were generated which covered 13.2 and 21.9 folds of the Matsumae and RZ35 genomes, respectively. Relative to Matsumae, a total of 41,724 homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 17,839 homozygous insertions/deletions (indels) were identified in RZ35, of which 3,797 SNPs were nonsynonymous mutations. Furthermore, rampant mobilization of transposable elements (TEs) was found in the RZ35 genome. The results of pathogen inoculation revealed that RZ35 exhibited enhanced resistance to blast relative to Matsumae. Notably, one nonsynonymous mutation was found in the known blast resistance gene Pid3/Pi25 and real-time quantitative (q) RTPCR analysis revealed constitutive up-regulation of its expression, suggesting both altered function and expression of Pid3/Pi25 may be responsible for the enhanced resistance to rice blast by RZ35. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that introgressive hybridization by Zizania has provoked genomewide, extensive genomic changes in the rice genome, and some of which have resulted in important phenotypic novelties. These findings suggest that introgressive hybridization by alien pollens of even a sexually incompatible species may represent a potent means to generate novel genetic diversities, and which may have played relevant roles in plant evolution and can be manipulated for crop improvements.	2013	10.1371/journal.pone.0074479		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wei Wenhui; Zhang Sufeng; Li Jun; Wang Lijun; Chen Bo; Fang Xiaoping; Wang Zhuan; Luo Lixia	Analysis of F-1 hybrid and BC1 monosomic alien addition line plants from Brassica oleracea x Sinapis alba by GISH	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN	Sterile and semi-fertile F-1 plants were obtained by intergeneric sexual hybridization between paternal Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra (genome CC, 2n=18) and maternal Sinapis alba (genome SS, 2n=24), BC1 plants were obtained by backcrossing between paternal B. oleracea and maternal semi-fertile F1 plants. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) combined with dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (dcFISH) showed that sterile F1 plants contained 21 chromosomes consisting of one B. oleracea chromosome set and one S. alba chromosome set, belonging to expected hybrids, and semi-fertile F1 plants contained 30 chromosomes consisting of two B. oleracea chromosome sets and one S. alba chromosome set. It is obvious that the semi-fertile F1 plants belong to unexpected hybrids. 1-3 trivalents were detected at meiotic metaphase I of semi-fertile F1 pollen mother cells (PMCs). Different separation ratios of S chromosomes were detected at anaphase I. A monosomic alien addition line (MAAL) was identified by GISH-dcFISH from BC1 plants; it contained 19 chromosomes consisting of 18 C chromosomes and 1 S chromosome. At meiotic metaphase I, 9 divalents from B. oleracea and one univalent from S. alba could be detected. Sometimes, one putative C-S trivalent could also be detected. The achievement of B. oleracea-S. alba monosomic alien addition lines lays a foundation for gene introgression, location and cloning.	2006	10.1007/s11434-006-2207-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Wei, Zili; Wang, Meng; Chang, Shihao; Wu, Chao; Liu, Peifa; Meng, Jinling; Zou, Jun	Introgressing Subgenome Components from Brassica rapa and B. carinata to B. juncea for Broadening Its Genetic Base and Exploring Intersubgenomic Heterosis	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Brassica juncea (A(j)A(j)B(j)B(j)), is an allotetraploid that arose from two diploid species, B. rapa (A(r)A(r)) and B. nigra ((BBn)-B-n). It is an old oilseed crop with unique favorable traits, but the genetic improvement on this species is limited. We developed an approach to broaden its genetic base within several generations by intensive selection. The A(r) subgenome from the Asian oil crop B. rapa (A(r)A(r)) and the B-c subgenome from the African oil crop B. carinata ((BBCCc)-B-c-C-c-C-c) were combined in a synthesized allohexaploid (A(r)A(r)B(c)B(c)C(c)C(c)), which was crossed with traditional B. juncea to generate pentaploid F-1 hybrids (A(r)A(j)B(c)B(j)C(c)), with subsequent self-pollination to obtain newly synthesized B. juncea (A(r/j)A(r/j)B(c/j)B(c/j)). After intensive cytological screening and phenotypic selection of fertility and agronomic traits, a population of new-type B. juncea was obtained and was found to be genetically stable at the F-6 generation. The new-type B. juncea possesses good fertility and rich genetic diversity and is distinctly divergent but not isolated from traditional B. juncea, as revealed by population genetic analysis with molecular markers. More than half of its genome was modified, showing exotic introgression and novel variation. In addition to the improvement in some traits of the new-type B. juncea lines, a considerable potential for heterosis was observed in inter-subgenomic hybrids between new-type B. juncea lines and traditional B. juncea accessions. The new-type B. juncea exhibited a stable chromosome number and a novel genome composition through multiple generations, providing insight into how to significantly broaden the genetic base of crops with subgenome introgression from their related species and the potential of exploring inter-subgenomic heterosis for hybrid breeding.	2016	10.3389/fpls.2016.01677		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wen, Aimin; Jayawardana, Malini; Fiedler, Jason; Sapkota, Suraj; Shi, Gongjun; Peng, Zhao; Liu, Sanzhen; White, Frank F.; Bogdanove, Adam J.; Li, Xuehui; Liu, Zhaohui	Genetic mapping of a major gene in triticale conferring resistance to bacterial leaf streak	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	A major gene conferring resistance to bacterial leaf streak was mapped to chromosome 5R in triticale. Bacterial leaf streak (BLS), caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (Xtu), is an important disease of wheat and triticale around the world. Although resistance to BLS is limited in wheat, several triticale accessions have high levels of resistance. To characterize the genetic basis of this resistance, we developed triticale mapping populations using a resistant accession (Siskiyou) and two susceptible accessions (UC38 and Villax St. Jose). Bulked segregant analysis in an F-2 population derived from the cross of Siskiyou x UC38 led to the identification of a simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker (XSCM138) on chromosome 5R that co-segregated with the resistance gene. The cross of Siskiyou x Villax St. Jose was advanced into an F-2:5 recombinant inbred line population and evaluated for BLS reaction. Genetic linkage maps on this population were assembled with markers generated using genotyping-by-sequencing as well as several SSR markers previously identified on 5R. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping revealed a single major QTL on chromosome 5R, underlined by the same SSR marker as in the Siskiyou x UC38 population. The F-1 hybrids of the two crosses were highly resistant to BLS, indicating that resistance is largely dominant. This work will facilitate introgression of this rye-derived BLS resistance gene into the wheat genome by molecular marker-mediated chromosome engineering.	2018	10.1007/s00122-017-3026-x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Williams, Warren M.; Verry, Isabelle M.; Ansari, Helal A.; Hussain, S. Wajid; Ullah, Ihsan; Williamson, Michelle L.; Ellison, Nicholas W.	Eco-geographically divergent diploids, Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum) and western clover (T. occidentale), retain most requirements for hybridization	ANNALS OF BOTANY	Background and Aims DNA sequence similarities and hybridization patterns in Trifolium (clovers) section Trifoliastrum suggest that rapid radiation from a common ancestral source led to this complex of diverse species distributed across Europe, western Asia and North Africa. Two of the most geographically and ecologically divergent of these species are the rhizomatous T. ambiguum from high altitudes in eastern Europe and western Asia and the stoloniferous T. occidentale from sea level in western Europe. Attempts were made to hybridize these species to ascertain whether, despite this separation, gene flow could be achieved, indicating the retention of the genetic factors necessary for hybridization. Methods Three F-1 hybrids formed after embryo rescue were described, characterized by conventional and molecular cytogenetics, subjected to fertility tests and progeny generations were developed. Results and Conclusions Partially fertile hybrids between Trifolium ambiguum and T. occidentale were obtained for the first time. The F-1 hybrids produced seeds after open-pollination, and also produced triploid progeny in backcrosses to T. occidentale from the functioning of unreduced gametes in the hybrids. These plants were fertile and produced progeny with T. occidentale and with T. repens. Meiotic chromosome pairing in the F-1 showed six to eight bivalents per pollen mother cell, indicating pairing between the parental genomes. A chromosome-doubled form of one hybrid, produced using colchicine, showed some multivalents, indicative of interspecific chromosome pairing. The hybrid plants were robust and combined phenotypic characteristics of both species, having stolons, thick roots and a few rhizomes. Results show that despite separation by the entire breadth of Europe, the speciation process is incomplete, and these taxa have partially retained most of the genetic compatibilities needed for hybridization (possibly except for endosperm development, which was not tested). The fertile progeny populations could lead to new clover breeding strategies based on new hybrid forms.	2011	10.1093/aob/mcr226		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Winter, Hendrik; Sterenberg, Karina; Sacristan, Maria Dolores	Resistance to a Brassica juncea-attacking isolate ofLeptosphaeria maculans inB-napusB-juncea lines	PROCEEDINGS OF THE JOINT MEETING OF THE FOURTEENTH CRUCIFER GENETICS WORKSHOP AND FOURTH ISHS SYMPOSIUM ON BRASSICAS	Blackleg caused by Leptosphaeria maculans (Phoma lingam) is the most significant disease affecting oilseed rape (Brassica napus) worldwide. Due to the narrow genetic background of current oilseed rape cultivars and limitations for GM crops in many parts of the world the importance of interspecific resistance transfer for plant breeding is expected to increase in the next years. Although wild crucifers are very promising resistance sources and blackleg resistances from these species have been successfully transferred into B. napus, resistance from the Brassica B genome still remains valuable. A test with double inoculation, performed in the greenhouse, was found to be the method of choice for accurate evaluation of plant resistance levels, both at the seedling and adult plant stages. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) is a powerful tool for the detection of alien chromosomes in interspecific hybrids, but for the visualisation of alien introgressions limitations in Brassica and related genera have to be considered. In this study GISH was applied to dihaploid (DH) backcross progenies from interspecific hybrids between B. napus (genome AACC, 2n=38) and B. juncea (AABB, 2n=36) exhibiting resistance to blackleg. Putative recombination lines (2n=38) with oilseed rape karyotype (no B genome GISH signals) were identified. Plants showed adult plant resistance to two aggressive isolates (PG 4), W4 from Germany and M1 from Australia. The latter was known to overcome the Brassica B genome resistance. Adult plant resistance to isolate W4 was found to be inherited by a single dominant gene. In the case of M1 adult plant resistance was detected in several B. napus-B. juncea DH lines, although the parents in the original cross, B. napus 'Liropa' and B. juncea, were both susceptible. Crossing experiments revealed that the monogenic inheritance of adult plant resistance to Ml is modified by an additional epistatic gene.	2006	10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.706.30		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgrssion lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wisniewska, H.; Kwiatek, M.; Kulak-Ksiazczyk, S.; Apolinarska, B.	Introgression of A- and B-genome of tetraploid triticale chromatin into tetraploid rye	JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS	An improvement of rye is one of the mainstream goals of current breeding. Our study is concerned with the introduction of the tetraploid triticale (ABRR) into the 4x rye (RRRR) using classical methods of distant crossing. One hundred fifty BC1F9 hybrid plants [(4x rye x 4x triticales) x 4x rye] obtained from a backcrossing program were studied. The major aim of this work was to verify the presence of an introgressed A- and B- genome chromatin of triticale in a collection of the 4x rye-tiritcale hybrids and to determine their chromosome compositions. In the present study, karyotypes of the previously reported BC(1)F(2)s and BC(1)F(3)s were compared with that of the BC1F9 generation as obtained after several subsequent open pollinations. The genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) allowed us to identify 133 introgression forms in which chromosome numbers ranged between 26 and 32. Using four DNA probes (5S rDNA, 25S rDNA, pSc119.2 and pAs1), the fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was carried out to facilitate an exact chromosome identification in the hybrid plants. The combination of the multi-colour GISH with the repetitive DNA FISH singled out five types of translocated chromosomes: 2A.2R, 4A.4R, 5A.5R, 5B.5R and 7A.7R among the examined BC(1)F(9)s. The reported translocation lines could serve as valuable sources of wheat chromatin suitable for further improvements of rye.	2013	10.1007/s13353-013-0171-z		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wondracek-Luedke, D. C.; Custodio, A. R.; Simpson, C. E.; Valls, J. F. M.	Crossability of Arachis valida and B genome Arachis species	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH	The peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an important food crop in much of the tropical and semi-tropical parts of the world. The peanut is an allotetraploid with an AABB genome formula derived from diploids A. duranensis (A genome) and A. ipaensis (B genome). The success of an introgression program that aims to improve cultivated varieties of the peanut depends on whether the chosen B genome species is homologous with the B genome of the peanut. While not directly involved in the origin of the peanut to the best of our knowledge, Arachis valida is a B genome species that could potentially be a bridge species or a source of new and different alleles, because of its resistance to diseases and pests. In this study, we investigated the crossability of A. valida with five other B genome species of section Arachis. Eight cross-combinations were made with A. valida and A. gregoryi, A. ipaensis, A. magna, A. valida, and A. williamsii. Two hundred and forty pollinations were made yielding 61 fruit segments, 61 seeds, one abortion, and 24 hybrid plants. An analysis of the morphological characteristics and pollen viability confirmed that the plants were hybrids. Our results indicated that higher pollen viability of hybrid plants corresponded with higher affinity between parent plants used in crossings. This conclusion corroborates much of previous research carried out by many other authors in the past.	2015	10.4238/2015.December.21.30		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Woolbright, S. A.; DiFazio, S. P.; Yin, T.; Martinsen, G. D.; Zhang, X.; Allan, G. J.; Whitham, T. G.; Keim, P.	A dense linkage map of hybrid cottonwood (Populus fremontii x P-angustifolia) contributes to long-term ecological research and comparison mapping in a model forest tree	HEREDITY	Cottonwoods are foundation riparian species, and hybridization among species is known to produce ecological effects at levels higher than the population, including effects on dependent species, communities and ecosystems. Because these patterns result from increased genetic variation in key cottonwood traits, novel applications of genetic tools (for example, QTL mapping) could be used to place broad-scale ecological research into a genomic perspective. In addition, linkage maps have been produced for numerous species within the genus, and, coupled with the recent publication of the Populus genome sequence, these maps present a unique opportunity for genome comparisons in a model system. Here, we conducted linkage analyses in order to (1) create a platform for QTL and candidate gene studies of ecologically important traits, (2) create a framework for chromosomal-scale perspectives of introgression in a natural population, and (3) enhance genome-wide comparisons using two previously unmapped species. We produced 246 backcross mapping (BC1) progeny by crossing a naturally occurring F-1 hybrid (Populus fremontii x P. angustifolia) to a pure P. angustifolia from the same population. Linkage analysis resulted in a dense linkage map of 541 AFLP and 111 SSR markers distributed across 19 linkage groups. These results compared favorably with other Populus linkage studies, and addition of SSR loci from the poplar genome project provided coarse alignment with the genome sequence. Preliminary applications of the data suggest that our map represents a useful framework for applying genomic research to ecological questions in a well-studied system, and has enhanced genome-wide comparisons in a model tree.	2008	10.1038/sj.hdy.6801063		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE

To investigate the introgression of the E. arundinaceus genome into sugarcane, five intergeneric F-1 hybrids between S. officinarum and E. arundinaceus and 13 of their BC1 progeny were studied using the genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique. In doing so, we assessed the chromosome composition and chromosome transmission in these plants. All F-1 hybrids were aneuploidy, containing either 28 or 29 E. arundinaceus chromosomes. The number of E. arundinaceus chromosomes in nine of the BC1 progeny was less than or equal to 29. Unexpectedly, the number of E. arundinaceus chromosomes in the other four BC1 progeny was above 29, which was more than in their F-1 female parents. This is the first cytogenetic evidence for an unexpected inheritance pattern of E. arundinaceus chromosomes in sugarcane. We pointed to several mechanisms that may be involved in generating more than 2n gametes in the BC1 progeny. Furthermore, the implication of these results for sugarcane breeding programs was discussed.	2014	10.1371/journal.pone.0110390		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Wu, Jinfeng; Li, Feng; Xu, Kun; Cao, Guizhen; Chen, Biyun; Yan, Cuixin; Wang, Nian; Qiao, Jiangwei; Li, Jun; Li, Hao; Zhang, Tianyao; Song, Weiling; Wu, Xiaoming	Assessing and broadening genetic diversity of a rapeseed germplasm collection	BREEDING SCIENCE	Assessing the level of genetic diversity within a germplasm collection contributes to evaluating the potential for its utilization as a gene pool to improve the performance of cultivars. In this study, 45 high-quality simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened and used to estimate the genetic base of a world-wide collection of 248 rapeseed (Brassica Papas.) inbred lines. For the whole collection, the genetic diversity of A genorne was higher than that of C genome. The genetic diversity of C genome for the semi-winter type was the lowest among the different germplasm types. Because B. oleracea is usually used to broaden the genetic diversity of C genome in rapeseed, we evaluated the potential of 25 wild B. oleracea lines. More allelic variations and a higher genetic diversity were observed in B. oleracea than in rapeseed. One B. oleracea line and one oilseed B. rapa line were used to generate a resynthesized Brassica napus line, which was then crossed with six semi-winter rapeseed cultivars to produce 7 F-1 hybrids. Not only the allele introgression but also mutations were observed in the hybrids, resulting in significant improvement of the genetic base.	2014	10.1270/jsbbs.64.321		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Wu, Jun; Yang, Xinmin; Wang, Hui; Li, Hongjie; Li, Lihui; Li, Xiuquan; Liu, Weihua	The introgression of chromosome 6P specifying for increased numbers of florets and kernels from Agropyron cristatum into wheat	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	A wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line 4844 with superior numbers of florets and grains per spike was derived from the cross between Fukohokomugi wheat and Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. In order to determine the genetic control of floret and kernel number per spike in this line, chromosome addition and substitution lines that were derived from line 4844 were characterized by means of in situ hybridization, microsatellite (SSR), and gliadin analyses. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis with biotinylated P genomic DNA of A. cristatum as a probe demonstrated that the increased number of florets and grains in a spike was associated with the introgression of an A. cristatum chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using a repetitive sequence, pAs1, derived from Aegilops squarrosa L., indicated the replacement of chromosome 6D of wheat in the wheat-A. cristatum chromosome substitution lines. This was confirmed by microsatellite analyses with wheat SSR markers specific for chromosome 6D, suggesting that the A. cristatum chromosome was homoeologous to group 6 and was therefore designated as 6P. This conclvsion was further confirmed by amplification using EST-SSR markers and gliadin analysis. The increased number of florets and kernels within a spike of the wheat-A. cristatum hybrids thus was controlled by gene(s) located on A. cristatum chromosome 6P.	2006	10.1007/s00122-006-0405-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgrssion lines	FALSE			FALSE

Cloning and characterization of repetitive sequences and development of SCAR markers specific for the P genome of Agropyron cristatum	EUPHYTICA	In previous studies, we successfully transferred the P genome of Agropyron cristatum into wheat using wide hybridization methods. In the current investigation, repetitive sequences were cloned and DNA markers specific for the P genome of A. cristatum were developed. Three P genome-specific markers, designated OPX07-1036, OPX11-817 and OPC05-1539, were identified and isolated using random amplified polymorphic DNAs. The three markers were successfully amplified in all tested materials that contained Agropyron chromatin, such as Agropyron itself and wheat-Agropyron addition lines. These RAPD markers were converted into SCAR markers to be used in detection of P genome chromatin in wheat. In situ probing with fluorescent-labeled marker DNA has shown that they are distributed in all arms of Agropyron hence they will be useful in a variety of studies on introgressions of the P-genome chromatin into wheat.	2010	10.1007/s10681-009-0033-2		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	marker dev	FALSE			FALSE	
Xi, Mengli; van Tuyl, Jaap M.; Arens, Paul	GISH analyzed progenies generated from allotriploid lilies as female parent	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE	Allotriploid lilies can produce aneuploid or euploid functional female gametes and can be used as the maternal parents in lily introgression breeding. In this study, the genome composition of 14 allopolyploid progenies, including 5 progenies which were derived from LLO x 1111, 5 progenies which were derived from LLO x OTOT, and 4 BC2 progenies which were derived from MAD x AA/AAAA, were analyzed using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) technique. The GISH results indicated that all of the 10 progenies which were derived from LLO x TTTT/OTOT were aneuploids, 4 BC2 progenies were euploids. Moreover, LLO always produced aneuploid functional female gametes, giving rise to aneuploid progenies, and MAD produced euploid functional female gametes including n or 2n gametes. Most interestingly, T/O recombinant chromosomes, which were caused by abnormal meiosis, were observed in 2 progenies of LLO x OTOT. Based on the analysis, we proposed that aneuploids might provide a promising approach for lily breeding. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Xia, Guangmin	Progress of chromosome engineering mediated by asymmetric somatic hybridization	JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND GENOMICS	Plant somatic hybridization has progressed steadily over the past 35 years. Many hybrid plants have been generated from fusion combinations of different phylogenetic species, some of which have been utilized in crop breeding programs. Among them, asymmetric hybrid, which usually contains a fraction of alien genome, has received More attention because of its importance in crop improvement. However, few studies have dealt with the heredity of the genome of somatic hybrid for a long time, which has limited the progress of this approach. Over recent ten years, along with the development of an effective cytogenetical tool "in situ hybridization (ISH)", asymmetric fusion of common wheat (Tilticum aestivum L.) with different grasses or cereals has been greatly developed. Genetics, genomes, functional genes and agricultural traits of wheat asymmetric hybrids have been subject to systematic investigations using gene cloning, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular makers. The future goal is to fully elucidate the functional relationships among improved agronomic traits, the genes and underlying molecular mechanisms, and the genome dynamics of somatic introgression lines. This will accelerate the development of elite germplasms via somatic hybridization and the application of these materials in the molecular improvement of crop plants.	2009	10.1016/S1673-8527(08)60146-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Xiang, Fengning; Wang, Junfeng; Xu, Chunhui; Xia, Guangmin	The chromosome content and genotype of two wheat cell lines and of their somatic fusion product with oat	PLANTA	Somatic hybridization seeks to genetically combine phylogenetically distant parents. An effective system has been established in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) involving protoplasts from a non-totipotent cell line adapted to in vitro culture (T-1) in combination with totipotent protoplasts harvested from embryogenic calli (T-2). Here, we report the karyotype and genotype of T-1 and T-2. Line T-1 carries nine A (A-genome of wheat), seven B (B-genome of wheat) and eight D (D-genome of wheat) genome chromosomes, while T-2 cells have 12 A, 10 B and 12 D genome chromosomes. Rates of chromosome aberration in the B- and D-genomes were more than 25%, higher than in the A-genome. DNA deletion rates were 55.6% in T-1 and 19.4% in T-2, and DNA variation rates were 8.3% in T-1 and 13.9% in T-2. Rate of DNA elimination was B- > D- > A-genome in both T-1 and T-2. The same set of cytological and genetic assays was applied to a derivative of the somatic fusion between protoplasts of T-1, T-2 and oat (Avena sativa L.). The regenerant plants were near euploid with respect to their wheat complement. Six wheat chromosome arms-4AL, 3BS, 4BL, 3DS, 6DL and 7DL-carried small introgressed segments of oat chromatin. A genotypic analysis of the hybrid largely confirmed this cytologically-based diagnosis.	2010	10.1007/s00425-010-1113-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Xiao, Zhiliang; Han, Fengqing; Hu, Yang; Xue, Yuqian; Fang, Zhiyuan; Yang, Limei; Zhang, Yangyong; Liu, Yumei; Li, Zhansheng; Wang, Yong; Zhuang, Mu; Lv, Honghao	Overcoming Cabbage Crossing Incompatibility by the Development and Application of Self-Compatibility-QTL-Specific Markers and Genome-Wide Background Analysis	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Cabbage hybrids, which clearly present heterosis vigor, are widely used in agricultural production. We compared two S5 haplotype (Class II) cabbage inbred-lines 87-534 and 94-182: the former is highly SC while the latter is highly SI; sequence analysis of SI-related genes including SCR, SRK, ARC1, THL1, and MLPK indicates the some SNPs in ARC1 and SRK of 87-534; semi-quantitative analysis indicated that the SI-related genes were transcribed normally from DNA to mRNA. To unravel the genetic basis of SC, we performed whole-genome mapping of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing self-compatibility using an F-2 population derived from 87-534 x 96-100. Eight QTLs were detected, and high contribution rates (CRs) were observed for three QTLs: qSC7.2 (54.8%), qSC9.1 (14.1%) and qSC5.1 (11.2%). 06-88 (CB201 x 96-100) yielded an excellent hybrid. However, F-1 seeds cannot be produced at the anthesis stage because the parents share the same S-haplotype (S57, class I). To overcome crossing incompatibility, we performed rapid introgression of the self-compatibility trait from 87-534 to 96-100 using two self-compatibility-QTL-specific markers, BoID0709 and BoID0992, as well as 36 genome-wide markers that were evenly distributed along nine chromosomes for background analysis in recurrent back-crossing (BC). The transfer process showed that the proportion of recurrent parent genome (PRPG) in BC4F1 was greater than 94%, and the ratio of individual SC plants in BC4F1 reached 100%. The newly created line, which was designated SC96-100 and exhibited both agronomic traits that were similar to those of 96-100 and a compatibility index (CI) greater than 5.0, was successfully used in the production of the commercial hybrid 06-88. The study herein provides new insight into the genetic basis of self-compatibility in cabbage and facilitates cabbage breeding using SC lines in the male-sterile (MS) system.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.00189		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Xie, S.; Ramanna, M. S.; Arens, P.; van Tuyl, J. M.	GISH Investigation of Crossover Events during Meiosis of Interspecific Hybrids of Lily	III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE GENUS LILIUM	Crossover not only establishes proper segregation of homologous/homoeologous chromosomes during meiosis I, but also promotes genetic diversity though creating new recombination of maternal and paternal alleles, which is essential for introgression breeding. In this paper, crossovers between non-sister chromatids were observed during meiosis of interspecific hybrids of Lilium longiflorum x Asiatic (LA) using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Results showed that different types of crossing over events, viz. single, two strand double, three strand double, four strand double crossovers, occurred between non-sister chromatids during meiosis of selected interspecific lily hybrids. From an analysis of a total of 637 pairs of half-bivalents it was evident that a large majority (65%) was two strand single crossovers, 5.5% were two strands double, 3.0% three strand double, 9.3% four strand double and 17.3% were multiple crossing over events. In one specific genotype which showed the existence of a reciprocal translocation, the frequency of multiple crossovers was relatively high, which might alter the map distances of markers on the translocated chromosomes.	2014			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Xie, Songlin; Ramanna, M. S.; van Tuyl, J. M.	Simultaneous Identification of Three Different Genomes in Lilium Hybrids through Multicolour GISH	XXIII INTERNATIONAL EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM, SECTION ORNAMENTALS, COLOURFUL BREEDING AND GENETICS - PT II	An attempt was made to identify the chromosomes of three different parental genomes in Lilium hybrids through multicolour GISH. The genotypes used in this study were derived from crossing an allotriploid consisting of two genomes of Longiflorum and one genome of Oriental group of Lilium (i.e., LLO) with an allotetraploid possessing two genomes of Longiflorum and two of Trumpet (LLTT). The progenies of these crosses were aneuploid, as expected, and multicolour GISH could clearly distinguish the three constituent genomes simultaneously in somatic cells. Unlike in previous studies, this analysis has shown that GISH can discriminate genomes not only when they belong to species of different sections but also when they belong to the same section as in the case of Longiflorum and Trumpet.	2010			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Xu, Chao-hua; Liu, Xin-long; Burner, David M.; Abbas, Zaheer; Pan, Yong-Bao; Elgamal, Ibrahim Soliman; Lu, Xin; Su, Huo-sheng	Phenotypic and Molecular Characterization of a Core Collection of Saccharum spontaneum L. in China	SUGAR TECH	Saccharum spontaneum L. is widely used in developing new sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) cultivars due to its ability to transmit high vigor, ratooning ability, and increased tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Interspecific hybridization helps to broaden the genetic diversity of modern sugarcane cultivars, but there is a continual need to collect and characterize new sources of germplasm. The objective of this study was to evaluate a primary core collection of 92 S. spontaneum genotypes (82 were of Chinese origin) using 29 phenotypic traits and 15 simple sequence repeat markers. There was considerable morphological variation among the S. spontaneum genotypes. Principal component and heatmap analyses indicated that the genotypes could be separated into four groups using two major traits related to yield (stalk length, stalk diameter, and stalk weight) and juice quality traits (juice Brix, juice fiber, juice sucrose, and apparent purity). Genotypes collected from the same geographic location did not cluster together, so geography alone was not a good predictor of genotypic divergence in this collection. Phenotypic trait data alone failed to fully differentiate genotypes, but a combination of phenotypic and molecular data was useful in characterizing the genotypes. The phenotypic and molecular characterization of unexploited S. spontaneum germplasm will facilitate in the identification of potential parents for introgression and identification of high-yielding, disease-resistant cultivars, energy canes, and cultivars suited for abiotic stresses, thereby increasing the economic sustainability of sugarcane.	2020	10.1007/s12355-019-00761-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Xu, Chuan-Yuan; Zeng, Xiao-Ying; Li, Zai-Yun	Establishment and characterization of Brassica juncea-Orychophragmus violaceus additions, substitutions and introgressions	EUPHYTICA	Intergeneric hybridizations between cultivated Brassica species and Orychophragmus violaceus have been shown to be an efficient approach to produce Brassica aneuploids. Herein B. juncea-O. violaceus additions, substitutions and introgressions were obtained among progenies of partial hybrids after B. juncea (2n = 36) was pollinated by O. violaceus (2n = 24) and they expressed some traits from O. violaceus or novel for two parents. The single O. violaceus chromosome which was added to or substituted into the B. juncea chromosome complement was distinguishable most easily in pollen mother cells at anaphase I (AI) from its darker staining and more condensed form. The one pair of the O. violaceus chromosome in the substitutions paired and segregated regularly with others from B. juncea, and the single one formed one bivalent with one B. juncea chromosome and showed normal segregation and was more darkly stained in some AI group. Stable introgressions with 2n = 36 gave amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) profiles mainly similar to those of the female B. juncea parent, but fragments specific for O. violaceus could be found in every plants together with those deleted in B. juncea and novel bands for two parents. The mechanisms behind these unusual results are discussed.	2007	10.1007/s10681-007-9367-9		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Hybrid Decay: A Transgenerational Epigenetic Decline in Vigor and Viability Triggered in Backcross Populations of Teosinte with Maize	GENETICS	Xue et al. describe a phenomenon in maize and its nearest wild relative, teosinte, by which backcross progeny of a specific teosinte and maize exhibit a sickly whole-plant phenotype involving changes in morphology, vigor, and viability... In the course of generating populations of maize with teosinte chromosomal introgressions, an unusual sickly plant phenotype was noted in individuals from crosses with two teosinte accessions collected near Valle de Bravo, Mexico. The plants of these Bravo teosinte accessions appear phenotypically normal themselves and the F-1 plants appear similar to typical maize x teosinte F(1)s. However, upon backcrossing to maize, the BC1 and subsequent generations display a number of detrimental characteristics including shorter stature, reduced seed set, and abnormal floral structures. This phenomenon is observed in all BC individuals and there is no chromosomal segment linked to the sickly plant phenotype in advanced backcross generations. Once the sickly phenotype appears in a lineage, normal plants are never again recovered by continued backcrossing to the normal maize parent. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing reveals a small number of genomic sequences, some with homology to transposable elements, that have increased in copy number in the backcross populations. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings, which do not have striking phenotypic abnormalities, identified segments of 18 maize genes that exhibit increased expression in sickly plants. A de novo assembly of transcripts present in plants exhibiting the sickly phenotype identified a set of 59 upregulated novel transcripts. These transcripts include some examples with sequence similarity to transposable elements and other sequences present in the recurrent maize parent (W22) genome as well as novel sequences not present in the W22 genome. Genome-wide profiles of gene expression, DNA methylation, and small RNAs are similar between sickly plants and normal controls, although a few upregulated transcripts and transposable elements are associated with altered small RNA or methylation profiles. This study documents hybrid incompatibility and genome instability triggered by the backcrossing of Bravo teosinte with maize. We name this phenomenon "hybrid decay" and present ideas on the mechanism that may underlie it.	2019	10.1534/genetics.119.302378		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Yam, T. W.; Lee, Y. I.	Chromosome Pairing Behaviour in the Interspecific Hybrids of Dendrobium Section Spatulata	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GERMPLASM OF ORNAMENTALS	The species in section Spatulata of Dendrobium have colorful, attractive and long-lasting flowers that have been introduced into breeding programs for potted plants and cut-flower market. In this study, we investigated the meiotic chromosome pairing in some new interspecific hybrids of Dendrobium section Spatulata. At metaphase I of meiosis, the pairing of parental chromosomes was mostly as bivalents in the intra-section hybrids and some inter-section hybrids, providing the opportunity for recombination to take place between the two component genomes. Consequently, high frequency of normal sporad (spore tetrad) was observed, suggesting that high fertility of these hybrids. High frequency of homoeologous chromosome pairing would guarantee genome introgression of parental species in these interspecific hybrids when they were used in subsequent breeding programs.	2013			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Karyotypic study	FALSE			FALSE	
Yan, Guijun; Liu, Hui; Wang, Haibo; Lu, Zhanyuan; Wang, Yanxia; Mullan, Daniel; Hamblin, John; Liu, Chunji	Accelerated Generation of Selfed Pure Line Plants for Gene Identification and Crop Breeding	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Production of pure lines is an important step in biological studies and breeding of many crop plants. The major types of pure lines for biological studies and breeding include doubled haploid (DH) lines, recombinant inbred lines (RILs), and near isogenic lines (NILs). DH lines can be produced through microspore and megaspore culture followed by chromosome doubling while RILs and NILs can be produced through introgressions or repeated selfing of hybrids. DH approach was developed as a quicker method than conventional method to produce pure lines. However, its drawbacks of genotype-dependency and only a single chance of recombination limited its wider application. A recently developed fast generation cycling system (FGCS) achieved similar times to those of DH for the production of selfed pure lines but is more versatile as it is much less genotype-dependent than DH technology and does not restrict recombination to a single event. The advantages and disadvantages of the technologies and their produced pure line populations for different purposes of biological research and breeding are discussed. The development of a concept of complete in vitro meiosis and mitosis system is also proposed. This could integrate with the recently developed technologies of single cell genomic sequencing and genome wide selection, leading to a complete laboratory based pre-breeding scheme.	2017	10.3389/fpls.2017.01786		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Yan, Mingli; Liu, Xianjun; Guan, Chunyun; Liu, Lili; Xiang, Jianhua; Lu, Ying; Liu, Zhongsong	Cloning of TTG1 gene and PCR identification of genomes A, B and C in Brassica species	GENETICA	Arabidopsis Transparent Testa Glabra 1 (TTG1) genes were cloned from three diploid Brassica species (B. rapa, B. nigra and B. oleracea) and two amphidiploids species (B. juncea and B. carinata) by homology cloning. TTG1 homologues identified in all the accessions of the investigated species had a coding sequence of 1,014 bp. One copy was obtained from each diploid species and two copies from each amphidiploid species. Combined analysis of the TTG1 sequences cloned in this study with those obtained from public databases demonstrated that three, forty-five and seven nucleotides were specific variations in TTG1 genes from genomes A, B and C, respectively. Primers designed with genome-specific nucleotide variations were able to distinguish among TTG1 genes originating from genomes A, B and C in Brassica. Therefore, the TTG1 gene could serve as a candidate marker gene to detect the pollen flow of Brassica and provide an alternative method for the detection of pollen drift and risk assessment of gene flow in Brassica species.	2014	10.1007/s10709-014-9764-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

On crossing maize-Tripsacum (2n = 4x = 56, MMTT) with Z. perennis, 37 progenies with varying chromosome numbers (36-74) were obtained, and a special one (i.e., tripsazea) possessing 2n = 74 chromosomes was generated. Tripsazea is perennial and expresses phenotypic characteristics affected by its progenitor parent. Flow cytometry analysis of tripsazea and its parents showed that tripsazea underwent DNA sequence elimination during allohexaploidization. Of all the chromosomes in diakinesis I, 18.42% participated in heterogenetic pairing, including 16.43% between the M- and P-genomes, 1.59% between the M- and T-genomes, and 0.39% in T- and P-genome pairing. Tripsazea is male sterile and partly female fertile. In comparison with previously synthesized trihybrids containing maize, Tripsacum and teosinte, tripsazea has a higher chromosome number, higher seed setting rate, and vegetative propagation ability of stand and stem. However, few trihybrids possess these valuable traits at the same time. The potential of tripsazea is discussed with respect to the deployment of the genetic bridge for maize improvement and forage breeding.	2020	10.1534/g3.119.400942		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Yang, Dabing; Tang, Jianhao; Yang, Di; Chen, Ying; Ali, Jauhar; Mou, Tongmin	Improving rice blast resistance of Feng39S through molecular marker-assisted backcrossing	RICE	Background Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most widespread biotic constraints that threaten rice production. Using major resistance genes for rice blast resistance improvement is considered to be an efficient and technically feasible approach to achieve optimal grain yield. Results We report here the introgression of the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene Pi2 into the genetic background of an elite PTGMS line, Feng39S, for enhancing it and its derived hybrid blast resistance through marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) coupled with genomics-based background selection. Two PTGMS lines, designated as DB16206-34 and DB16206-38, stacking homozygous Pi2 were selected, and their genetic background had recurrent parent genome recovery of 99.67% detected by the SNP array RICE6K. DB16206-34 and DB16206-38 had high resistance frequency, with an average of 94.7%, when infected with 57 blast isolates over 2 years, and the resistance frequency of their derived hybrids ranged from 68.2% to 95.5% under inoculation of 22 blast isolates. The evaluation of results under natural blast epidemic field conditions showed that the selected PTGMS lines and their derived hybrids were resistant against leaf and neck blast. The characterizations of the critical temperature point of fertility-sterility alternation of the selected PTGMS lines, yield, main agronomic traits, and rice quality of the selected PTGMS lines and their hybrids were identical to those of the recurrent parent and its hybrids. DB16206-34/9311 or DB16206-38/9311 can be used as a blast-resistant version to replace the popular hybrid Fengliangyou 4. Likewise, DB16206-34/FXH No.1 or DB16206-38/FXH No.1 can also be used as a blast-resistant version to replace another popular hybrid Fengliangyou Xiang 1. Conclusions Our evaluation is the first successful case to apply MABC with genomics-based background selection to improve the blast resistance of PTGMS lines for two-line hybrid rice breeding.	2019	10.1186/s12284-019-0329-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression line	FALSE			FALSE	
Yang, Xiao-Yue; Wang, Ze-Fu; Luo, Wen-Chun; Guo, Xin-Yi; Zhang, Cai-Hua; Liu, Jian-Quan; Ren, Guang-Peng	Plastomes of Betulaceae and phylogenetic implications	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Betulaceae is a well-defined family of Fagales, including six living genera and more than 160 modern species. Species of the family have high ecological and economic value for the abundant production of wood. However, phylogenetic relationships within Betulaceae have remained partly unresolved, likely due to the lack of a sufficient number of informative sites used in previous studies. Here, we re-investigate the Betulaceae phylogeny with whole chloroplast genomes from 24 species (17 newly assembled), representing all genera of the family. All the 24 plastomes are relatively conserved with four regions, and each genome is similar to 158-161 kb long, with 111 genes. The six genera are all monophyletic in the plastome tree, whereas Ostrya Scop. is nested in the Carpinus clade in the internal transcribed spacer tree. Further incongruencies are also detected within some genera between species. Incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybrid introgression during the diversification of the family could account for such incongruencies. Our dating analysis, based on four fossils, suggests that the most recent common ancestors of the extant genera date back to the mid- to late Miocene, and confirms that Betulaceae started to diversify in the upper Cretaceous/early Paleocene. Our results highlight the significance of using more informative sites in resolving phylogenetic relationships. Plastome data and increased taxon sampling will help to better understand the evolutionary history of Betulaceae in the future.	2019	10.1111/jse.12479		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	*did not quantify introgression	FALSE			FALSE

In the present study, intergeneric F-1 hybrids of SHW-L1 - Aegilops peregrina AS24 were produced without embryo rescue. Among the 31 F-1 hybrid plants observed, 20 had the expected chromosome number 2n = 35 and were euploids (genome ABDUS(I)). The remainder 11 plants were aneuploids with 33, 34, 36 and 37 chromosomes, indicating that the neoallohexaploid SHW-L1 was cytologically instable and produced aneuhaploid gametes with 19, 20, 22 and 23 chromosomes, respectively. The hybrid plant lacking chromosome 5B carrying Ph1 showed a very high level of homoeologous chromosome pairing. The absence of Ph gene provides a potent cytological mechanism for DNA introgression among homoeologous chromosomes between newly synthetic wheat and wild species.	2011			Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

We have examined the mobilization of mPing in four NERICA (New Rice for Africa) lines and 13 interspecific lines. All 17 lines are inbred progenies derived from crosses between Oryza sativa variety WAB56-104 as the recurrent parent and the O. glaberrima variety CG14 as the donor parent. We found that 16 of the 17 lines studied inherited mPing together with its autonomous partner, Pong, from WAB56-104. Transposon display of mPing disclosed polymorphic banding patterns among these lines. Most importantly, seven of the lines displayed clear polymorphic banding patterns for mPing, indicating that mPing might have been mobilized in these lines. Locus-specific PCR analysis also confirmed the mobilization of mPing. These results signify that interspecific hybridization may activate the transposition of mPing. Based on these results, we discuss the potential use of the mPing system as an efficient tool for gene tagging in interspecific hybrid rice.	2013	10.1007/s10681-012-0810-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Yi Chuan-deng; Li Wei; Wang De-rong; Jiang Wei; Hu Da-bang; Zhou Yong; Liang Guo-hua; Gu Ming-hong	Identification and cell wall analysis of interspecific hybrids between Oryza sativa and Oryza ridleyi	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE	Oryza ridleyi is an allotetraploid wild species with the HHJJ genome, and Otyza sativa is a diploid cultivated rice that has the AA genome. Although the wide hybrid between the two species is difficult to obtain, we overcome this difficulty by young embryo rescue. An obvious heterosis was primarily found for the plant height, tillering ability, vegetative vigor, etc. However, the hybrid panicle and culm traits were found to resemble that of the wild rice parent, O. ridleyi, for the long awns, exoteric purple stigma, grain shattering, dispersed panicles, and culm mechanical strength. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis was subsequently performed on the mitotic metaphase chromosome of the root tips, and we determined that the hybrid is an allotriploid with 36 chromosomes and its genomic constitution is AHJ. Chemical analyses conducted on the culm of O. sativa, O. ridleyi, and their interspecific hybrids showed that major changes occurred in the xylose, glucose, and arabinose concentrations, which are correlated with the specific hemicellulose polymer and cellulose components that are important in the primary cell walls of green plants. Meanwhile, the culm anatomical analyses indicated that additional large vascular bundles and an extra sclerenchyma cell layer were found in O. ridleyi. Additionally, further thickening of the secondary cell walls of the cortical fiber sclerenchyma cells and the phloem companion cells was discovered in O. ridleyi and in the interspecific hybrids. These results imply that there may be a potential link between culm mechanical strength and culm anatomical structure.	2017	10.1016/S2095-3119(16)61526-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Younis, Adnan; Ramzan, Fahad; Hwang, Yoon-Jung; Lim, Ki-Byung	FISH and GISH: molecular cytogenetic tools and their applications in ornamental plants	PLANT CELL REPORTS	The innovations in chromosome engineering have improved the efficiency of interrogation breeding, and the identification and transfer of resistance genes from alien to native species. Recent advances in molecular biology and cytogenetics have brought revolutionary, conceptual developments in mitosis and meiosis research, chromosome structure and manipulation, gene expression and regulation, and gene silencing. Cytogenetic studies offer integrative tools for imaging, genetics, epigenetics, and cytological information that can be employed to enhance chromosome and molecular genomic research in plant taxa. In situ hybridization techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), can identify chromosome morphologies and sequences, amount and distribution of various types of chromatin in chromosomes, and genome organization during the metaphase stage of meiosis. Over the past few decades, various new molecular cytogenetic applications have been developed. The FISH and GISH techniques present an authentic model for analyzing the individual chromosome, chromosomal segments, or the genomes of natural and artificial hybrid plants. These have become the most reliable techniques for studying allopolyploids, because most cultivated plants have been developed through hybridization or polyploidization. Moreover, introgression of the genes and chromatin from the wild types into cultivated species can also be analyzed. Since hybrid derivatives may have variable alien chromosome numbers or chromosome arms, the use of these approaches opens new avenues for accurately identifying genome differences.	2015	10.1007/s00299-015-1828-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Yu, Yan; Ye, Wenxuan; He, Li; Cai, Xingkui; Liu, Ting; Liu, Jun	Introgression of bacterial wilt resistance from eggplant to potato via protoplast fusion and genome components of the hybrids	PLANT CELL REPORTS	Bacterial wilt resistant somatic hybrids were obtained via protoplast fusion between potato and eggplant and three types of nuclear genomes were identified in the hybrids through GISH and SSR analysis. Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) lacks resistance to bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. Interspecific symmetric protoplast fusion was conducted to transfer bacterial wilt resistance from eggplant (S. melongena, 2n = 2x = 24) into dihaploid potato (2n = 2x = 24). In total, 34 somatic hybrids were obtained, and of these, 11 rooted and were tested for genome components and resistance to race 1 of R. solanacearum. The hybrids exhibited multiple ploidy levels and contained the dominant nuclear genome from the potato parent. Three types of nuclear genomes were identified in the hybrids through genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis, including (1) the potato type of the tetraploids in which eggplant chromosomes could not be detected by GISH but their nuclear DNA was confirmed by SSR, (2) the biased type of the hexaploids in which the chromosome dosage was 2 potato:1 eggplant, and (3) the chromosome translocation type of the mixoploids and aneuploids that was characterized by various rates of translocations of nonhomologous chromosomes. Cytoplasmic genome analysis revealed that mitochondrial DNA of both parents coexisted and/or recombined in most of the hybrids. However, only potato chloroplast DNA was retained in the hybrids speculating a compatibility between cpDNA and nuclear genome of the cell. The pathogen inoculation assay suggested a successful transfer of bacterial wilt resistance from eggplant to the hybrids that provides potential resistance for potato breeding against bacterial wilt. The genome components characterized in present research may explain partially the inheritance behavior of the hybrids which is informative for potato improvement.	2013	10.1007/s00299-013-1480-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

APMS 6B has good combining ability and plant stature but is highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) disease. In order to improve the BB resistance of APMS 6B, we pyramided two major, dominant BB resistance genes, Xa21 and Xa38, through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB). Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) was used as the donor for Xa21 while PR 114 (Xa38) served as the donor for Xa38. Individual crosses [APMS 6B/ISM and APMS 6B/PR 114 (Xa38)] were performed, and true F-1 plants were then backcrossed with APMS 6B and the MABB process was continued till BC3. A single positive BC3F1 plant identified from both the crosses with maximum genotypic and phenotypic similarity with APMS 6B was selfed to generate BC(3)F(2)s. At BC3F2 generation, plants homozygous for either Xa21 or Xa38 were identified and further confirmed for the absence of two major fertility restorer genes, Rf3 and Rf4. A single such homozygous BC3F2 plant, each from both the crosses, was then inter-mated to generate ICF(1)s (inter-cross F(1)s). Selected ICF1 plants possessing both the BB resistance genes were selfed to generate ICF(2)s. A total of 42 ICF2 plants homozygous for both Xa21 and Xa38 were identified and screened with parental polymorphic SSR markers to identify the best F-2 plants having the maximum recurrent parent genome recovery. Twelve best ICF2 plants were advanced up to ICF5. The ICF5 lines displayed very high level of BB resistance and were similar to APMS 6B in terms of agro-morphological characters. Further, most of these lines also showed complete maintenance ability and such lines are being advanced for conversion to WA-CMS lines.	2018	10.1007/s11032-018-0853-7		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zaharieva, M; Monneveux, P	Spontaneous hybridization between bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its wild relatives in Europe	CROP SCIENCE	In Europe, wild wheat relatives of the Triticum-Aegilops complex grow in sympatry with cultivated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and spontaneous hybridization is known to occur. With the development of transgenic wheat, an understanding of the likelihood and occurrence of hybridization and introgression between wheat and its relatives is needed for use in risk assessment. To assess the probability of wheat to wild relative gene introgression, the distribution and biology of wheat wild relatives and their genome affinity and crossability with bread wheat were reviewed. Twelve of the 22 known Aegilops species, as well as one wild Triticum species, T. monococcum L. subsp. aegilopoides (Link) Thell., are known to occur in Europe near or within wheat cultivation. Five tetraploid species, Ae. cylindrica Host., Ae. triuncialis L., Ae. geniculata Roth., Ae. neglecta Req. ex Berthol., and Ae. biuncialis Vis., have wide distribution in most European countries. Bread wheat, wild Aegilops species, and Triticum species are predominantly autogamous (except Ae. speltoides Tausch, typically allogamous), but outcrossing among species is possible depending on species sympatry, concurrent flowering, and sexual compatibility. Spontaneous hybridization with wheat was reported for most of the tetraploid Aegilops species. The probability of gene transfer and gene retention in hybrid progenies is, however, higher when a gene is located on a shared genome, particularly on the D genome shared with Ae. cylindrica and Ae. ventricosa Tausch. Case-by-case and region-by-region assessments are needed to evaluate the risk associated with production and competitiveness of hybrids and their progeny.	2006	10.2135/cropsci2005.0023		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Review	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhan, Zongxiang; Nwafor, Chinedu Charles; Hou, Zhaoke; Gong, Jianfang; Zhu, Bin; Jiang, Yingfen; Zhou, Yongming; Wu, Jiangsheng; Piao, Zhongyun; Tong, Yue; Liu, Chao; Zhang, Chunyu	Cytological and morphological analysis of hybrids between Brassicoraphanus, and Brassica napus for introgression of clubroot resistant trait into Brassica napus L	PLOS ONE	Interspecific hybridization is a powerful tool for improvement of crop species, it has the potential to broaden the genetic base and create new plant forms for breeding programs. Synthetic allopolyploid is a widely-used model for the study of genetic recombination and fixed heterosis in Brassica. In Brassica napus breeding, identification and introgression of new sources of clubroot resistance trait from wild or related species into it by hybridization is a long-term crop management strategy for clubroot disease. Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is a close relative of the Brassica and most radish accessions are immune to the clubroot disease. A synthesized allotetraploid Brassicoraphanus (RRCC, 2n = 36) between R. sativus cv. HQ-04 (2n = 18, RR) and Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra (L.H Bailey) (2n = 18, CC) proved resistant of multiple clubroot disease pathogen P. brassicae. To predict the possibility to transfer the clubroot resistance trait from the RR subgenome of allotetraploid Brassicoraphanus (RRCC, 2n = 36) into Brassica napus (AACC, 2n = 38), we analyzed the frequency of chromosome pairings in the F-1 hybrids produced from a cross between B. napus cv. HS5 and the allotetraploid, characterize the genomic composition of some back-crossed progeny (BC1) using GISH, BAC-FISH and AFLP techniques. The level of intergenomic pairing between A and R genomes in the F-1 hybrid was high, allosyndetic bivalents formed in 73.53% PMCs indicative of significant level of homeologous recombination between two genomes and high probability of incorporating chromosomal segments/genes from R-genome into A/C-genomes. The BC1 plants inherited variant extra R chromosomes or fragments from allotetraploid as revealed by GISH and AFLP analysis. 13.51% BC2 individuals were resistant to clubroot disease, and several resistance lines had high pollen fertility, Overall, the genetic material presented in this work represents a potential new genetic resource for practical use in breeding B. napus clubroot resistant cultivars.	2017	10.1371/journal.pone.0177470		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhang, Dale; Zhou, Yun; Zhao, Xinpeng; Lv, Linlin; Zhang, Cancan; Li, Junhua; Sun, Guiling; Li, Suoping; Song, Chunpeng	Development and Utilization of Introgression Lines Using Synthetic Octaploid Wheat (Aegilops tauschii x Hexaploid Wheat) as Donor	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	As the diploid progenitor of common wheat, Aegilops tauschii Cosson (DD, 2n = 2x = 14) is considered to be a promising genetic resource for the improvement of common wheat. In this work, we demonstrated that the efficiency of transferring A. tauschii segments to common wheat was clearly improved through the use of synthetic octaploid wheat (AABBDDDD, 2n = 8x = 56) as a "bridge." The synthetic octaploid was obtained by chromosome doubling of hybrid F-1 (A. tauschii T015 x common wheat Zhoumai 18). A set of introgression lines (BC1F8) containing 6016 A. tauschii segments was developed and displayed significant phenotype variance among lines. Twelve agronomic traits, including growth duration, panicle traits, grain traits, and plant height (PH), were evaluated. And transgressive segregation was identified in partial lines. Additionally, better agronomic traits could be observed in some lines, compared to the recurrent parent Zhoumai 18. To verify that the significant variance of those agronomic traits was supposedly controlled by A. tauschii segments, 14 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for three important agronomic traits (thousand kernel weight, spike length, and PH) were further located in the two environments (Huixian and Zhongmou), indicating the introgression of favorable alleles from A. tauschii into common wheat. This study provides an ameliorated strategy to improve common wheat utilizing a single A. tauschii genome.	2018	10.3389/fpls.2018.01113		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhang, Fantao; Cui, Fenglei; Zhang, Liangxing; Wen, Xiufang; Luo, Xiangdong; Zhou, Yi; Li, Xia; Wan, Yong; Zhang, June; Xie, Jiankun	Development and identification of a introgression line with strong drought resistance at seedling stage derived from Oryza sativa L. mating with Oryza rufipogon Griff	EUPHYTICA	Drought stress is severely damaging during seedling stage of rice (Oryza sativa L.), which can lead to significant yield reductions. Dongxiang common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff., hereafter referred to as DXWR), with strong drought resistance, could be a favorable genetic resource to improve the drought resistance of cultivated rice. Xieqingzao B (O. sativa L. ssp. indica, hereafter referred to as XB) is a representative maintainer line in hybrid rice breeding system in China. By using DXWR as donor parent, XB as recurrent parent, through continuous selfing, back-crossing and strict drought-resistant screening, we developed a strong and stable drought-resistant introgression line IL395 (BC5F10), whose ability of drought resistance was significantly increased than that of the recurrent parent XB at the seedling stage. Meanwhile, no significant differences existed among other major agronomic traits under normal condition, except for plant height. Physiological assessment revealed that IL395 exhibited a significant increase in levels of free proline and soluble sugars, which was associated with drought resistance. Whole genome marker analyses identified genomic segments of DXWR linking with RM171 and RM590 (chr. 10) and RM235 (chr. 12) that require further analysis as possible sources of drought resistance trait. These results suggest that DXWR could be a favorable genetic resource to improve the drought resistance of cultivated rice, and the IL395 might be a useful resource for excavating the drought-resistant genes from DXWR.	2014	10.1007/s10681-014-1121-5		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhang, LQ; Liu, DC; Yan, ZH; Zheng, YL	Alien DNA introgression and wheat DNA rearrangements in a stable wheat line derived from the early generation of distant hybridization	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES C-LIFE SCIENCES	Polyploidy has been found to be common in plants. Bread or common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 42) is a good example of allopolyploid made up of three diploid genomes A, B and D. In recent years, by the study of mimicking the origination of common wheat, it was found that changes of DNA sequence and gene expression occurred at the early stages of artificial allohexaploid between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii, which was probably favorable to genetic diploidization of new synthetic hexaploid wheat. Common wheat 99L2 is a new line stable in genetic, which was derived from the early self-pollinated generation of wide hybrids between common wheat and rye. In this study, it was found that at least two rye DNA segments had been introgressed into 99L2. This result suggested that a mechanism of alien DNA introgression may exist, which was different from the traditional mechanism of chromosome pairing and DNA recombination between wheat and alien species. Meanwhile, during the introgression process of alien rye DNA segments, the changes in DNA sequences of wheat itself occurred.	2005	10.1360/062004-45		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics/manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhang, Meishan; Xu, Chunming; Yan, Hongyan; Zhao, Na; von Wettstein, Diter; Liu, Bao	Limited tissue culture-induced mutations and linked epigenetic modifications in F-1 hybrids of sorghum pure lines are accompanied by increased transcription of DNA methyltransferases and 5-methylcytosine glycosylases	PLANT JOURNAL	In plant tissue culture, developmental disturbance and mutagenic factors are involved in channeling an individual totipotent cell to an intact plant. Comparing a pair of sorghum reciprocal F-1 hybrids with their parental pure lines revealed a dramatic difference in the occurrence of both genetic and DNA methylation alterations in the respective regenerated plants. In contrast to those of the pure lines, regenerated plants of hybrids exhibit significantly enhanced genetic and epigenetic stability. The genetic changes detected by amplified fragment length polymorphism and the DNA methylation alterations detected by methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism are intimately correlated with each other, suggesting a common mechanism underlying both kinds of instabilities. Markedly altered transcription of genes encoding four putative sorghum DNA methyltransferases and two 5-methylcytosine glycosylases with nucleotide sequences orthologous to Arabidopsis counterparts was induced by tissue culture. The steady-state transcript levels of these genes were negatively correlated with genetic and methylation alterations. A salient observation is that tissue culture-induced transcription of genes encoding DNA methyltransferases and 5-methylcytosine glycosylases in calli and/or regenerated plants of the hybrids was remarkably coordinated, but is largely uncoordinated and stochastically altered in calli and/or regenerated plants of the pure lines. We suggest that the uncoordinated regulation of expression of DNA methyltransferases and 5-methylcytosine glycosylases is a major cause of the high incidence of genetic and DNA methylation alterations in cultures of pure lines, but coordinated up-regulated expression of these enzymes in cultures of the F-1 hybrids fortified their genetic and epigenetic stability.	2009	10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03719.x		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	manip crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhang, Ming; Liu, Zhao; Jan, Chao-Chien	Molecular mapping of a rust resistance gene R-14 in cultivated sunflower line PH 3	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Sunflower, the fifth largest oilseed crop in the world, plays an important role in human diets. Recently, sunflower production in North America has suffered serious yield losses from newly evolved races of sunflower rust (Puccinia helianthi Schwein.). The rust resistance gene, designated R-14, in a germplasm line PH 3 originated from a wild Helianthus annuus L. population resistant to 11 rust races. PH 3 has seedling with an extraordinary purple hypocotyl color. The objectives of this study were to map both the R-14 rust resistance gene and the purple hypocotyl gene-designated PHC in PH 3, and to identify molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding for sunflower rust resistance. A set of 517 mapped SSR/InDel and four SNP markers was used to detect polymorphisms between the parents. Fourteen markers covering a genetic distance of 17.0 cM on linkage group (LG) 11 were linked to R-14. R-14 was mapped to the middle of the LG, with a dominant SNP marker NSA_000064 as the closest marker at a distance of 0.7 cM, and another codominant marker ORS542 linked at 3.5 cM proximally. One dominant marker ZVG53 was linked on the distal side at 6.9 cM. The PHC gene was also linked to R-14 with a distance of 6.2 cM. Chi-squared analysis of the segregation ratios of R-14, PHC, and ten linked markers indicated a deviation from an expected 1:2:1 or 3:1 ratio. The closely linked molecular or morphological markers could facilitate sunflower rust-resistant breeding and accelerate the development of rust-resistant hybrids.	2016	10.1007/s11032-016-0456-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Manipulative cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhang, Shou Gong; Yang, Wen Hua; Han, Su Ying; Han, Bo Tao; Li, Mao Xue; Qi, Li Wang	Cytogenetic analysis of reciprocal hybrids and their parents between Larix leptolepis and Larix gmelinii: implications for identifying hybrids	TREE GENETICS & GENOMES	We studied the parental taxa and the interspecific reciprocal hybrids between Larix leptolepis with Larix gmelinii, using classical cytogenetic methods, as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization. A high frequency (> 90%) of complete bivalent formation was observed in reciprocal hybrids. Less than 10% of pollen mother cells exhibited abnormalities. The most frequent abnormalities were bridges. Multivalent chromosome associations were also observed in both reciprocal hybrids, suggesting that some chromosome interchange events did occur, and introgressions from one to the other species were possible. Intergenomic recombination indicates that genes might be readily introgressed into one species from the other in the genus Larix. Interspecific hybridization may be a potential method for genetic improvement in larch. FISH markers documented that the recombinant genomes of reciprocal hybrids were strictly additive and stable, indicating that FISH also might be a useful tool in Larix breeding.	2010	10.1007/s11295-009-0258-1		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhao, Jun; Liu, Jianguang; Xu, Jianwen; Zhao, Liang; Wu, Qiaojuan; Xiao, Songhua	Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping and Candidate Gene Analysis for Verticillium Wilt Resistance Using Gossypium barbadense Chromosomal Segment Introgressed Line	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Verticillium wilt (VW) is a soil-borne fungal disease that is caused by Verticillium dahliae Kleb and seriously damages cotton production annually in China. To date, many efforts have been made to improve the resistance of upland cotton against VW, but little progress has been achieved because of a lack of resistant upland cotton to VW. G. barbadense is known to carry high resistance to VW; however, it is difficult to transfer the resistance trait from G. barbadense to upland cotton because of linkage drag and distortion in the interspecific hybrid. In this study, a chromosomal segment introgression line (CSIL), SuVR043, containing a single and homozygous chromosome segment of G. barbadense cv. H7124 D04 (Chr 22), was created and used to construct an F2 population for mapping of VW resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the greenhouse. Two major resistance QTLs against nondefoliating V. dahliae isolate Bp2, called qVW-Bp2-1 and qVW-Bp2-2, which were flanked by the markers cgr6409-ZHX37 and ZHX57-ZHX70 and explained an average of 16.38 and 22.36% of the observed phenotypic variation, respectively, were detected in three independent replicate experiments. The genetic distances from cgr6409 to ZHX37 and from ZHX57 to ZHX70 were 2.4 and 0.8 cM, respectively. By analyzing the genome sequence of the qVW-Bp2-1 and qVW-Bp2-2 regions, we determined that the accurate physical distances from cgr6409 to ZHX37 and from ZHX57 to ZHX70 in the G. barbadense genome are 254 and 140 kb, and that those spans 36 and 20 putative genes, respectively. The results of the expression analysis showed significant differences in the expression profiles of GbCYP450, GbTMEM214, and GbRLK among G. barbadense cv. H7124, CSIL SuVR043 and G. hirsutum acc. Sumian 8 at different times after inoculation with V. dahliae isolate Bp2. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis showed that silencing of GbCYP450 and GbTMEM214 decreased H7124 and CSIL SuVR043 resistance to VW. These results form a solid foundation for fine mapping and cloning of resistance genes in the substituted segment and will provide valuable assistance in future efforts to breed for VW resistance.	2018	10.3389/fpls.2018.00682		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhao, Xianrong; Tan, Guoqing; Xing, Yuexian; Wei, Lai; Chao, Qing; Zuo, Weiliang; Luebberstedt, Thomas; Xu, Mingliang	Marker-assisted introgression of qHSR1 to improve maize resistance to head smut	MOLECULAR BREEDING	Head smut, one of the most devastating diseases in maize, causes severe yield losses worldwide. Resistance to head smut has been proven to be a quantitative inherited trait. In our previous study, a major resistance quantitative trait locus (named qHSR1) was detected on maize chromosome 2 (bin 2.09), and a number of molecular markers have been developed in the qHSR1 region. Here, we report the marker-assisted introgression of qHSR1 to improve maize resistance to head smut. The 10 maize inbred lines, namely Ji853, 444, 98107, 99094, Chang7-2, V022, V4, 982, 8903, and 8902, which have high yield potential but are susceptible to head smut, were selected for resistance improvement. Each of the 10 high-yielding lines was crossed with a donor parent Ji1037 that is completely resistant to head smut, followed by five generations of backcrossing to the respective recurrent parent. Marker-assisted foreground selection was conducted to identify qHSR1. Recombinant selection was carried out in the fourth backcross (BC4) generation by using the flanking markers to reduce the size of the Ji1037 donor segment carrying qHSR1. Background selection was performed in the BC5 generation with genome-wide SSR markers to select the line with the highest recovery rate of the recurrent parent genome. Self-pollination was conducted twice for the BC5 plant with both the shortest qHSR1 region and the highest recovery rate to obtain converted inbred lines harboring qHSR1. The 10 converted inbred lines all showed substantial improvement in resistance to head smut. Furthermore, the hybrids prepared from the converted lines also showed significant increase in resistance to head smut, while remaining mostly unchanged for other agronomic traits.	2012	10.1007/s11032-011-9694-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhao, Xin; Xu, Xiaowei; Xie, Hongxia; Chen, Shaojiang; Jin, Weiwei	Fertilization and Uniparental Chromosome Elimination during Crosses with Maize Haploid Inducers	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY	Producing maternal haploids via a male inducer can greatly accelerate maize (Zea mays) breeding process. However, the mechanism underlying haploid formation remains unclear. In this study, we constructed two inducer lines containing cytogenetic marker B chromosome or alien centromeric histone H3 variant-yellow fluorescent protein vector to investigate the mechanism. The two inducer lines as the pollinators were crossed with a hybrid ZhengDan958. B chromosomes were detected in F1 haploids at a low frequency, which was direct evidence to support the occurrence of selective chromosome elimination during haploid formation. We found that most of the inducer chromosomes were eliminated in haploid embryonic cells during the first week after pollination. The gradual elimination of chromosomes was also detected in the endosperm of defective kernels, although it occurred only in some endosperm cells as late as 15 d after pollination. We also performed a genome-wide identification of single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the inducers, noninducer inbred lines, and 42 derived haploids using a 50K single nucleotide polymorphism array. We found that an approximately 44-Mb heterozygous fragment from the male parent was detected in a single haploid, which further supported the occurrence of paternal introgression. Our results suggest that selective elimination of uniparental chromosomes leads to the formation of haploid and possible defective kernels in maize as well, which is accompanied with unusual paternal introgression in haploid cells.	2013	10.1104/pp.113.223982		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhao, Xinwang; Li, Bao; Zhang, Ka; Hu, Kaining; Yi, Bin; Wen, Jing; Ma, Chaozhi; Shen, Jinxiong; Fu, Tingdong; Tu, Jinxing	Breeding signature of combining ability improvement revealed by a genomic variation map from recurrent selection population in Brassica napus	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	Combining ability is crucial for parent selection in crop hybrid breeding. The present investigation and results had revealed the underlying genetic factors which might contribute in adequate combining ability, further assisting in enhancing heterosis and stability. Here, we conducted a large-scale analysis of genomic variation in order to define genomic regions affecting the combining ability in recurrent selection population of rapeseed. A population of 175 individuals was genotyped with the Brassica60K SNP chip. 525 hybrids were assembled with three different testers and used to evaluate the general combining ability (GCA) in three environments. By detecting the changes of the genomic variation, we identified 376 potential genome regions, spanning 3.03% of rapeseed genome which provided QTL-level resolution on potentially selected variants. More than 96% of these regions were located in the C subgenome, indicating that C subgenome had sustained stronger selection pressure in the breeding program than the A subgenome. In addition, a high level of linkage disequilibrium in rapeseed genome was detected, suggesting that marker-assisted selection for the population improvement might be easily implemented. This study outlines the evidence for high GCA on a genomic level and provided underlying molecular mechanism for recurrent selection improvement in B. napus.	2016	10.1038/srep29553		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY	Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae), is one of the most destructive and widespread plant diseases in the world. Utilization of resistance genes in rice breeding is considered to be an effective and economical method to control this disease. To identify new sources of blast resistance, a set of 1160 introgression lines (ILs) containing chromosome segments of Chaling common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) in the genetic background of an elite indica rice variety 93-11 were developed and phenotyped in the blast nursery. Thirty-three ILs displaying stable blast resistance in three consecutive years were obtained. Among them, one line, IL1043, was subsequently found to be resistant to all of the 28 M. oryzae isolates from different regions through artificial inoculation in greenhouse. By combining bulk segregant analysis coupled with next-generation sequencing (BSA-seq) and recessive class analysis (RCA), a major blast resistance gene in IL1043, designated Picl(t), was mapped on rice chromosome 6 flanked by the markers RM527 and Indel6 with an interval of approximately 925 kb, which covers the Pi2/9 locus. These results will facilitate fine mapping and cloning of Picl(t), and the linked markers will further provide a useful tool for rice blast resistance breeding.	2020	10.1111/jph.12883		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression Line	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhou, AF; Xia, GM	Introgression of the Haynaldia villosa genome into gamma-ray-induced asymmetric somatic hybrids of wheat	PLANT CELL REPORTS	To study the effect of gamma-ray treatment on donor and derived somatic hybrids, we carried out gamma-ray donor treatment experiments with a wide range of gamma-ray dosages and asymmetric somatic hybridization between protoplasts of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Jinan 177) and protoplasts of Haynaldia villosa Schur. treated with different dosages of gamma-rays (40, 60 and 80 Gy, respectively). We first screened the putative hybrids by isozyme analysis, followed by characterization of nuclear and organellar genome composition of the hybrids. Genomic in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphases demonstrated that the donor chromosome elimination in the hybrids increased with increased gamma-ray dosage. Intergenomic chromosome recombination/translocations were observed in the hybrids from different dosages of gamma-rays. PCR amplification of 5S rDNA spacer sequences showed that only some of the regenerated hybrid clones inherited donor 5S rDNA sequences, suggesting that the donor DNA was also eliminated randomly. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using mitochondrion (mt) and chloroplast (cp) gene-specific probes showed that the hybrid calli contained mt genomes of both parents and the cp genome of only one of the parents. Recombinations between parental mt as well as cp genes were found in the hybrid clones. Furthermore, development of the hybrid clones was dependent on the gamma-ray dosage used for the donor treatment. Regenerated plants were only obtained from fusion combinations of low (40 Gy) and intermediate (60 Gy) dose irradiation. The possible role and significance of gamma-rays on the introgression of small segments of donor chromosomes to the receptor is discussed.	2005	10.1007/s00299-005-0922-3		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhou, Shujun; Ramanna, M. S.; Visser, Richard G. F.; van Tuyl, Jaap M.	Genome composition of triploid lily cultivars derived from sexual polyploidization of Longiflorum x Asiatic hybrids (Lilium)	EUPHYTICA	About 19 cultivars, which had originated from backcrosses between F1 LA (Longiflorum x Asiatic) hybrids (2n = 2x = 24) as female parents and Asiatic cultivars as male parents (2n = 2x = 24), were analyzed with genomic in situ hybridization. 17 of them were triploid (2n = 3x = 36), and two aneuploid (2n = 3x + 1 = 37). The triploid cultivars had resulted from the functional 2n eggs produced by the female parents (F1 hybrids) because first division restitution (FDR) occurred in their meiosis during megasporogenesis. Similarly, the aneuploid cultivars had originated from viable 2n + 1 eggs. The extra chromosome in cultivar 041555 or 041572 resulted from one univalent or one half-bivalent which might have lagged behind when the sister chromatids of the other univalents and half-bivalents were segregating during the FDR process in their LA hybrid parents, respectively. That the majority of cultivars possessed recombinant chromosomes showed that intergenomic recombination might play an important role during the selection of the cultivars directly from BC1 progenies. That five cultivars of the 15 recombinant cultivars only had reciprocal recombinant chromosomes and 10 cultivars had non-reciprocal recombinant chromosomes indicates that the latter are more important. Because 9 of the 10 non-reciprocal recombinant cultivars possessed substitutions for recombinant segments, it also indicated that such substitutions could be an important source for the genetic variation in the sexual triploid BC1 progenies. In such cases there was a potential for the expression of the recessive genes of the backcross parent in a nulliplex (aaa) condition in the substituted segments. Genetic variation resulting from such nulliplex loci might have played a role in the selection of some of the cultivars.	2008	10.1007/s10681-007-9538-8		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics/manip cross	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhou, Shujun; Ramanna, Munikote S.; Visser, Richard G. F.; van Tuyl, Jaap M.	Analysis of the meiosis in the F-1 hybrids of Longiflorum x Asiatic (LA) of lilies (Lilium) using genomic in situ hybridization	JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND GENOMICS	Longiflorum and Asiatic lilies of the genus Lilium of the family Liliaceae are two important groups of modem lily cultivars. One of the main trends of lily breeding is to realize introgression between these groups. With cut style pollination and embryo rescue, distant hybrids between the two groups have been obtained. However, the F-1 hybrids are highly sterile or some of them could produce a small number of 2n gametes, and their BC1 progenies are usually triploids. Dutch lily breeders have selected many cultivars from these BC1 progenies based on their variation. It is presumably suggested that such variation could be caused by intergenomic recombination and abnormal meiosis during gamete formation in F-1 hybrids of Longiflorum, x Asiatic (LA) hybrids in Lilium. Therefore, the meiotic process of ten F-1 LA hybrids was cytologically investigated using genomic in situ hybridization and traditional cytological methods in the present research. The results showed that: at metaphase I, the homoeologous chromosome pairing among different F-1 hybrids ranged from 2.0 to 11.4 bivalents formed by homoeologous chromosomes per pollen mother cell (PMC), and very few multivalents, and even very few bivalents were formed by two chromosomes within one genome rather than homoeologous chromosomes in some PMCs; at anaphase I, all bivalents were disjoined and most univalents were divided. Both the disjoined bivalents (half-bivalents) and the divided univalents (sister chromatids) moved to the opposite poles, and then formed two groups of chromosomes; because the two resulting half-bivalents retained their axes in the cell undisturbed, many crossover types, including single crossovers, three strand double crossovers, four strand double crossovers, four strand triple crossovers, and four strand multiple crossovers between the non-sister chromatids in the tetrads of bivalents, were clearly inferred by analyzing the breakpoints on the disjoined bivalents. The present investigation not only explained the reason for sterility of the F-1 LA hybrids and the variation of their BC1 progenies, but also provided a new method to analyze crossover types in other F-1 interspecific hybrids as well.	2008	10.1016/S1673-8527(08)60091-0		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

To test the hypothesis, OTO lilies, 'Belladonna', 'Candy Club' and 'Travatore', were used as the maternal parents and crossed with two diploid OO cultivars, 'Siberia' and 'Sorbonne', and the species L. regale Wilson (TT). Results showed that capsules of all OTO x OO hybridizations developed well and 0.8 similar to 3.3 viable seedlings per ovary were obtained through normal pollination and embryo rescue; however, all OTO x TT crosses failed. Genomic in situ hybridization showed that the progenies of the OTO x OO hybridizations were aneuploid and a variable number of T-genome chromosomes were introduced into the progenies through the allotriploid lilies. The present results not only demonstrate that allotriploid OTO lilies, although male sterile, can be used as maternal parents to produce aneuploid progenies, but also strongly support the new hypothesis in lily breeding.	2014	10.1270/jsbbs.64.97		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zhu, Weihong; Zhao, Yikun; Liu, Jingbao; Huang, Lu; Lu, Xiaomin; Kang, Dingming	QTL mapping analysis of maize plant type based on SNP molecular marker	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY	In this study, the elite maize inbred line (Zheng683-1) was used as a recurrent parent and the four maize inbred lines (ZPH1388, ZPH5, Dong 237 and Chang 7-2) were used as donor parents. The four F1 hybrids were produced by crossing between them and were continued backcrossing to the recurrent parent to produce four BC3F1s. The BC3F1 were pollinated by selfing four generations to generate the recombinant inbred lines (BC3F5) that showed variation in plant height, ear height, leaf angle. There were 53 lines for Zheng683-1 x ZPH1388, 53 lines for Zheng683-1 x ZPH5, 48 lines for Zheng683-1 x Dong237 and 61 lines for Zheng683-1 x Chang 7-2. The four populations were genotyped by using SNP marker and identified the QTLs of targeted traits by using QTL IciMapping V4.1 software and stepwise regression analysis. The main results are as follows:1. 19 additive QTLs and 2 dominant QTLs about plant height were detected in four introgression lines, and 7, 4, 5, 5 QTLs related plant height in ZPH1388-IL, ZPH5-IL, Dong237-ILand Chang7-2-IL. Among the 21 plant height QTLs, the largest contribution to phenotypic variation was QTLqPHa12 from Dong237-IL population, which evaluated 43.44% of the phenotypic variation of plant height . Followed by qPHa3 from ZPH1388-IL, the phenotypic contribution rate was 20% 2. Sixteen QTLs related ear height were detected in the population of the 4 introgression lines, of which there were 15 additive and 1 dominant QTLs. In addition, 9, 3, and 4 QTLs were detected in ZPH1388-IT, ZPH5-II, and Dong237-II, respectively. Among the 16 ear height QTLs, the largest contribution to phenotypic variation was QTL (qEHa1) from the ZPH1388 IL, which recorded the phenotypic variation of ear height by 26.01%. Next the phenotype contribution rates were 22.05% and 21.46%, respectively for qEHa13 and qEHa15 from Dong237-IL. Fourteen QTLs related leaf angle was detected in the population of the introgression lines, of which there were 5 additive QTLs and 9 dominant QTLs. Moreover, 2, 9, and 3 QTLs were detected in 7,PH1388-IT, ZPH5-IL, Dong237-IL respectively. Among the 14 leaf angle QTLs, the largest contribution to phenotypic variation was QTL (qLAa4) from the Dong237-IL then qLAa3 from ZPH5-IL, detecting the phenotypic variation of leaf angle of 28.56% and 24.084%o, respectively.The results showed that the QTL locus was characterized by uneven chromosome distribution. The chromosome 1, 2, 5, and 7 are the regions with the QTL concentrated distribution of plant type traits. The QTL of plant type also showed QTL concentrated distribution in some regions of chromosomes. For example, there are three QTLs about plant height and ear height in the region of chromosome three QTLs about plant and ear heights, as well as leaf angle in the region of chromosome bin 2.02. These areas are QTT , enrichment region (or the hot spots) of the pleiotropic gene loci related the plant type and ear traits.	2019	10.14715/cmb/2019.65.2.4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	maniupative crosses	FALSE			FALSE	
Zou, Jun; Zhu, Jiali; Huang, Shunmou; Tian, Entang; Xiao, Yong; Fu, Donghui; Tu, Jinxing; Fu, Tingdong; Meng, Jinling	Broadening the avenue of intersubgenomic heterosis in oilseed Brassica	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS	Accumulated evidence has shown that each of the three basic Brassica genomes (A, B and C) has undergone profound changes in different species, and has led to the concept of the "subgenome". Significant intersubgenomic heterosis was observed in hybrids between traditional Brassica napus and first generation lines of new type B. napus. The latter were produced by the partial introgression of subgenomic components from different species into B. napus. To increase the proportion of exotic subgenomic components and thus achieve stronger heterosis, lines of first generation new type B. napus were intercrossed with each other, and subjected to intensive marker-assisted selection to develop the second generation of new type B. napus. The second generation showed better agronomic traits and a higher proportion of introgression of subgenomic components than did the first generation. Compared with the commercial hybrid and the hybrids produced with the first generation new type B. napus, the novel hybrids showed stronger heterosis for seed yield during the 2 years of field trials. The extent of heterosis showed a significant positive correlation with the introgressed subgenomic components in the parental new type B. napus. To increase the content of the exotic subgenomic components further and to allow sustainable breeding of novel lines of new type B. napus, we initiated the development of a gene pool for new type B. napus that contained a substantial amount of genetic variation in the A(r) and C-c genome. We discuss new approaches to broaden the avenue of intersubgenomic heterosis in oilseed Brassica.	2010	10.1007/s00122-009-1201-4		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	crop dev	FALSE			FALSE

Development of Biofortified Maize Hybrids through Marker-Assisted Stacking of beta-Carotene Hydroxylase, Lycopene-epsilon-Cyclase and Opaque2 Genes	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Traditional yellow maize though contains high kernel carotenoids, the concentration of provitamin A (proA) is quite low (<2 mu g/g), compared to recommended level (15 mu g/g). It also possesses poor endosperm protein quality due to low concentration of lysine and tryptophan. Natural variant of crtRB1 (beta-carotene hydroxylase) and lcyE (lycopene-epsilon-cyclase) cause significant enhancement of proA concentration, while recessive allele, opaque2 (o2) enhances the level of these amino acids. Development of biofortified maize enriched in proA, lysine and tryptophan thus holds significance in alleviation of micronutrient malnutrition. In the present study, marker-assisted stacking of crtRB1, lcyE and o2 was undertaken in the genetic background of four maize hybrids (HQPM1, HQPM4, HQPM5, and HQPM7) popularly grown in India. HP704-22 and HP704-23 were used as donors, while four elite QPM parents viz., HKI161, HKI163, HKI193-1, and HKI193-2 were used as recipients. CrtRB1 showed severe segregation distortion, while lcyE segregated as per the expectation. Recovery of recurrent parent genome (RPG) among selected backcross progenies ranged from 89 to 93%. Introgressed progenies possessed high concentration of proA (7.38-13.59 mu g/g), compared to 1.65-2.04 mu g/g in the recurrent parents. The reconstituted hybrids showed an average of 4.5-fold increase in proA with a range of 9.2512.88 mu g/g, compared to original hybrids (2.14-2.48 mu g/g). Similar plant-, ear-, and grain- characteristics of improved versions of both inbreds and hybrids were observed when evaluated with their respective original versions. Mean lysine (0.334%) and tryptophan (0.080%) of the improved hybrids were at par with the original versions (lysine: 0.340%, tryptophan: 0.083%). Improved hybrids also possessed similar grain yield potential (6,301-8,545 kg/ha) with their original versions (6,135-8,479 kg/ha) evaluated at two locations. This is the first study of staking crtRB1-, lcyE-, and o2-, favorable alleles in single genetic background. The improved inbreds can be effectively used as potential donor for independent and/or simultaneous introgression of crtRB1, lcyE, and o2 in the future breeding programme. These biofortified maize hybrids, rich in proA, lysine and tryptophan will hold great promise for nutritional security.	2018	10.3389/fpls.2018.00178		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Zwierzykowski, Zbigniew; Zwierzykowska, Elzbieta; Taciak, Magdalena; Jones, Neil; Kosmala, Arkadiusz; Krajewski, Pawel	Chromosome pairing in allotetraploid hybrids of Festuca pratensis x Lolium perenne revealed by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH)	CHROMOSOME RESEARCH	Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to make a detailed study of chromosome pairing at metaphase I (MI) of meiosis in six F-1 hybrid plants of the allotetraploid Festuca pratensis x Lolium perenne (2n = 4x = 28; genomic constitution FpFpLpLp). The mean chromosome configurations for all hybrids analysed were 1.13 univalents + 11.51 bivalents + 0.32 trivalents + 0.72 quadrivalents, and the mean chiasma frequency was 21.96 per cell. GISH showed that pairing was predominantly intragenomic, with mean numbers of L. perenne (Lp/Lp) and F. pratensis (Fp/Fp) bivalents being virtually equal at 5.41 and 5.48 per cell, respectively. Intergenomic pairing between Lolium and Festuca chromosomes was observed in 33.3% of Lp/Fp bivalents (0.62 per cell), in 79.7% of trivalents - Lp/Lp/Fp and Lp/Fp/Fp (0.25 per cell), and in 98.4% of quadrivalents - Lp/Lp/Fp/Fp and Lp/Lp/Lp/Fp (0.71 per cell). About 4.0% of the total chromosome complement analysed remained as univalents, an average 0.68 Lp and 0.45 Fp univalents per cell. It is evident that in these hybrids there is opportunity for recombination to take place between the two component genomes, albeit at a low level, and this is discussed in the context of compromising the stability of Festulolium hybrid cultivars and accounting for the drift in the balance of the genomes over generations. We speculate that genotypic differences between hybrids could permit selection for pairing control, and that preferences for homologous versus homoeologous centromeres in their spindle attachments and movement to the poles at anaphase I could form the basis of a mechanism underlying genome drift.	2008	10.1007/s10577-008-1198-6		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	cytogenetics	FALSE			FALSE

Here, we reconstructed the phylogeographies of two upper intertidal species endemic to East Asia, Gelidiophycus divaricatus and G. freshwateri. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic inferences of 393 mitochondrial cox1, 128 plastid rbcL, and 342 nuclear ITS2 sequences were complemented with ecological niche models. Gelidiophycus divaricatus, a southern species adapted to warm water, is characterized by a high genetic diversity and a strong geographical population structure, characteristic of stable population sizes and sudden reduction to recent expansion. In contrast, G. freshwateri, a northern species adapted to cold temperate conditions, is genetically relatively homogeneous with a shallow population structure resulting from steady population growth and recent equilibrium. The overlap zone of the two species roughly matches summer and winter isotherms, indicating that surface seawater temperature is a key feature influencing species range. Unidirectional genetic introgression was detected at two sites on Jeju Island where G. divaricatus was rare while G. freshwateri was common, suggesting the occurrence of asymmetric natural hybrids, a rarely reported event for rhodophytes. Our results illustrate that Quaternary climate oscillations have left strong imprints on the current day genetic structure and highlight the importance of seawater temperature and sea level change in driving speciation in upper intertidal seaweed species.	2019	10.1111/jpy.12910		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	*did not quantify introgression (reticulate evolution)	FALSE			FALSE	
Campbell, Lesley G.; Lee, David; Shukla, Kruti; Waite, Thomas A.; Bartsch, Detlef	AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO MEASURING THE EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF GENE FLOW FROM CROPS TO WILD OR WEEDY RELATIVES	APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES	Premise of the study: Agricultural practices routinely create opportunities for crops to hybridize with wild relatives, leading to crop gene introgression into wild genomes. Conservationists typically worry this introgression could lead to genetic homogenization of wild populations, over and above the central concern of transgene escape. Alternatively, viewing introgression as analogous to species invasion, we suggest that increased genetic diversity may likewise be an undesirable outcome. Methods: Here, we compare the sensitivity of conventional population genetic metrics with species diversity indices as indicators of the impact of gene flow on genetic diversity. We illustrate this novel approach using multilocus genotype data (12 allozyme loci) from 10 wild (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima) and eight putative crop-wild hybrid beet populations (B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris x B. vulgaris subsp. maritima) scattered throughout Europe. Results: Conventional population genetic metrics mostly failed to detect shifts in genetic composition of putative hybrid populations. By contrast, species diversity indices unambiguously revealed increased genetic diversity in putative hybrid populations. Discussion: We encourage other workers to explore the utility of our more sensitive approach for risk assessment prior to the release of transgenic crops, with a view toward widespread adoption of our method in studies aimed at detecting allelic invasion.	2016	10.3732/apps.1500114		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	did not measure introgression	FALSE			FALSE	
Lopez-Lavalle, L. Augusto Becerra; Brubaker, Curt L.	Frequency and fidelity of alien chromosome transmission in Gossypium hexaploid bridging populations	GENOME	The Australian diploid Gossypium species possess traits of potential agronomical value, such as gossypol-free seeds and Fusarium wilt resistance. However, they belong to the tertiary germplasm pool, which is the most difficult group of species from which to introgress genes into G. barbadense L. and G. hirsutum L. lnterspecific triploid hybrids can be generated but they are sterile. The sterility barrier can be overcome using synthetic polyploids as introgression bridges, but whether there is sufficient homoeologous chromosome interaction at meiosis to allow recombination is still an open question. To ascertain, genetically, observable levels of homoeologous introgression, 2 synthetic hexaploid lines (2x G. hirsutum x G. australe and 2x G. hirstrturn x G. sturtianum) were crossed to G. hirsntum to generate pentaploid F-1 plants that. in turn, were backcrossed to G. hirstrtum to generate BC1 and BC2 multiple alien chromosome addition lines (MACALs). Gossypium australe F. Muell. and G. sturtianum Willis chromosome-specific markers were used to track the frequency and fidelity of chromosome transmission to the BC1 and BC2 MACALs. The chromosomal location of the AFLP markers was determined by their distribution among the MACALs and confirmed in parental F-2 families. Roughly half the available chromosomes were transmitted to the G. hirsntum x G. australe (54%) and G. hirsutum x G. sturtianum (52%) BC1 MACALs. The BC2 MACAL families again inherited about half of the available chromosomes. There were, however, notable exceptions for specific chromosomes. Some chromosomes were preferentially eliminated, while others were preferentially transmitted. Consistent with the genornic stability of Gossypium synthetic polyploids, the de novo loss or gain of AFLP fragments was rarely observed. While restructuring of the donor G. australe and G. sturtianum chromosomes seas observed. this is more likely the result of chromatin loss, and no clear cases of introgression of donor chromatin into the recipient G. hirsutum genome were observed.	2007	10.1139/G07-030		Plants			TRUE	TRUE	introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE

Flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and content of chromosome peaks was determined. Peaks of chromosome 1U could be discriminated in flow karyotypes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. biuncialis and the chromosome could be sorted with purities exceeding 95%. The remaining chromosomes formed composite peaks and could be sorted in groups of two to four. Twenty four wheat SSR markers were tested for their position on chromosomes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. comosa using PCR on DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA of wheat-Ae. geniculata addition lines, respectively. Six SSR markers were located on particular Aegilops chromosomes using sorted chromosomes, thus confirming the usefulness of this approach for physical mapping. The SSR markers are suitable for marker assisted selection of wheat-Aegilops introgression lines. The results obtained in this work provide new opportunities for dissecting genomes of wild relatives of wheat with the aim to assist in alien gene transfer and discovery of novel genes for wheat improvement.	2011	10.1371/journal.pone.0027708		Plants/Methods			TRUE	TRUE	Hybrid detection method	FALSE			FALSE	
Bierne, Nicolas; Gagnaire, Pierre-Alexandre; David, Patrice	The geography of introgression in a patchy environment and the thorn in the side of ecological speciation	CURRENT ZOOLOGY	When incompletely isolated taxa coexist in a patchy environment (e. g. mosaic hybrid zones, host-race complexes), patterns of variation may differ between selected traits/genes and neutral markers. While the genetic structure of selected traits/loci tends to coincide with habitat variables (producing Genetic-Environment Association or GEA), genetic differentiation at neutral loci unlinked to any selected locus rather depends on geographic connectivity at a large scale (e. g. Isolation-By-Distance or IBD), although these loci often display GEA at a small scale. This discrepancy has been repeatedly taken as evidence for parallel primary divergence driven by local adaptation. We argue that this interpretation needs to be addressed more thoroughly by considering the alternative hypothesis that speciation was initiated in allopatry and secondary introgression has subsequently erased the signal of past differentiation at neutral loci. We present a model of neutral introgression after secondary contact in a mosaic hybrid zone, which describes how GEAs dissipate with time and how neutral variation self-organizes according to the environmental and geographic structures. We show that although neutral loci can be affected by environmental selection, they are often more affected by history and connectivity: the neutral structure retains the initial geographic separation more than it correlates with the environment during the colonization and introgression phases, and then converges to a migration-drift balance, the most frequent outcome of which is GEA at a local scale but IBD at a large scale. This is the exact pattern usually attributed to parallel ecological speciation. Introgression is heterogeneous in space and depends on the landscape structure (e. g. it is faster in small patches, which are more impacted by immigration). Furthermore, there is no directionality in the association and it is possible to observe reversed GEAs between distant regions. We argue that the history of differentiation should ideally be reconstructed with selected loci or neutral loci linked to them, not neutral ones, and review some case studies for which the hypothesis of a long co-existence of co-adapted genetic backgrounds might have been refuted too hastily [Current Zoology 59 (1): 72-86, 2013].	2013	10.1093/czoolo/59.1.72		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Gompert, Zachariah	Population genomics as a new tool for wildlife management	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Admixture and introgression have varied effects on population viability and fitness. Admixture might be an important source of new alleles, particularly for small, geographically isolated populations. However, admixture might also cause outbreeding depression if populations are adapted to different ecological or climatic conditions. Because of the emerging use of translocation and admixture as a conservation and wildlife management strategy to reduce genetic load (termed genetic rescue), the possible effects of admixture have practical consequences (Bouzat 2009; Hedrick & Fredrickson 2010). Importantly, genetic load and local adaptation are properties of individual loci and epistatic interactions among loci rather than properties of genomes. Likewise, the outcome and consequences of genetic rescue depend on the fitness effects of individual introduced alleles. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Miller (2012) use model-based, population genomic analyses to document locus-specific effects of a recent genetic rescue in the bighorn sheep population within the National Bison Range wildlife refuge (NBR; Montana, USA). They find a subset of introduced alleles associated with increased fitness in NBR bighorn sheep, some of which experienced accelerated introgression following their introduction. These loci mark regions of the genome that could constitute the genetic basis of the successful NBR bighorn sheep genetic rescue. Although population genomic analyses are frequently used to study local adaptation and selection (e.g. Hohenlohe 2010; Lawniczak 2010), this study constitutes a novel application of this analytical framework for wildlife management. Moreover, the detailed demographic data available for the NBR bighorn sheep population provide a rare and powerful source of information and allow more robust population genomic inference than is often possible.	2012	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05471.x		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Harrison, Richard G.	THE LANGUAGE OF SPECIATION	EVOLUTION	The literature on speciation has expanded dramatically in recent years, catalyzed by the emergence of new conceptual frameworks, new theoretical approaches, and new methods for characterizing pattern and inferring process. As a consequence, the language used to describe the speciation process has become more complex. Increasing complexity may be an accurate reflection of current thinking with respect to how phenotypic differences limit gene flow, how selection results in the evolution of reproductive isolation, and genetic changes that contribute to speciation. However, increased language complexity has come at a cost; old definitions have been reconfigured and new terms have been introduced. In some instances, the introduction of new terminology has failed to recognize historical usage, leading to unnecessary ambiguity and redundancy. Although the writings of Mayr and Dobzhansky remain a reference point in the language of speciation, the last decades of the 20th century saw substantial changes in our thinking about the speciation process. During that period, the language of speciation remained relatively stable. In contrast, the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a remarkable expansion of the language of speciation. Here, the origin and evolution of ideas about speciation are viewed through the lens of changing language use.	2012	10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01785.x		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Robin	Retrospective View of North American Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) Breeding in the 20th and 21st Centuries	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS	Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), a vegetatively propagated autotetraploid, has been bred for distinct market classes, including fresh market, pigmented, and processing varieties. Breeding efforts have relied on phenotypic selection of populations developed from intra-and intermarket class crosses and introgressions of wild and cultivated Solanum relatives. To retrospectively explore the effects of potato breeding at the genome level, we used 8303 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers to genotype a 250-line diversity panel composed of wild species, genetic stocks, and cultivated potato lines with release dates ranging from 1857 to 2011. Population structure analysis revealed four subpopulations within the panel, with cultivated potato lines grouping together and separate from wild species and genetic stocks. With pairwise kinship estimates clear separation between potato market classes was observed. Modern breeding efforts have scarcely changed the percentage of heterozygous loci or the frequency of homozygous, single-dose, and duplex loci on a genome level, despite concerted efforts by breeders. In contrast, clear selection in less than 50 years of breeding was observed for alleles in biosynthetic pathways important for market class-specific traits such as pigmentation and carbohydrate composition. Although improvement and diversification for distinct market classes was observed through whole-genome analysis of historic and current potato lines, an increased rate of gain from selection will be required to meet growing global food demands and challenges due to climate change. Understanding the genetic basis of diversification and trait improvement will allow for more rapid genome-guided improvement of potato in future breeding efforts.	2013	10.1534/g3.113.005595		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Mumm, Rita H.	A Look at Product Development with Genetically Modified Crops: Examples from Maize	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY	Plant breeding for crop genetic improvement involves the cycle of creating genetic diversity and exploiting that diversity to derive an improved cultivar with outstanding performance for specific traits of interest. Genetic modification through transformation essentially expands the genepool to facilitate access to genes otherwise not available through crossing. Transgenic events are defined by the DNA sequence that has been incorporated into the target genome and the specific point(s) of insertion. In the development of a new transgenic trait, typically many events are generated and evaluated with the aim of identifying one exhibiting consistent trait expression at or above specified thresholds, stable inheritance, and the absence of any negative effects. With transgenic traits for maize, once commercial candidates have been identified, these events are introgressed into elite lines, often through the use of molecular markers that can accelerate the breeding process and aid in producing a quality conversion. Converted elite lines are yield-tested to ensure performance equivalency with their unconverted counterparts. Finally, before commercial sale of seed, quality control monitoring is conducted to ensure event identity and purity and the absence of any unintended events. This monitoring complements other quality control measures to confirm seed viability and line/hybrid purity and uniformity in seed treatments, all in an effort to ensure customer satisfaction and to comply with governmental regulations. Thus, genetically modified (GM) cultivars are subject to significant testing and auditing prior to seed sale and distribution to farmers, more testing and auditing than with non-GM cultivars.	2013	10.1021/jf400685y		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Orozco-Terwengel, Pablo A.; Bruford, Michael W.	Mixed signals from hybrid genomes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Admixture results from interbreeding between individuals from different populations or species that were previously genetically isolated from each other (Fig.). Identifying admixture events in the genome is not always a straightforward task, because the genetic signature left behind fades with time as recombination events fragment the genomic segments introduced during the interbreeding event. Additionally, when the genetic architecture of populations or species that admix is not very different (e.g. they coalesce to a common ancestor recently), admixture signatures may be difficult to detect. Ignoring the effects of admixture can, however, pose severe problems for population genetic analyses that rely on the distribution of polymorphic markers across the genome. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Bosse etal. () analyse genomic data from modern pigs to understand hybridization processes that occurred between domestic pigs from European and Asiatic origin, and between pigs and wild boars. Their results are interesting regarding the fine-scale distribution of admixture across the pig genome, and the way in which this admixture biases estimates of the effective population size in European domestic pigs. The implications of these results are significant, as they serve as a cautionary note on genomic analyses that depend on the distribution of polymorphic variants in potentially admixed populations.	2014	10.1111/mec.12863		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Peng, Ting; Sun, Xiaochun; Mumm, Rita H.	Optimized breeding strategies for multiple trait integration: I. Minimizing linkage drag in single event introgression	MOLECULAR BREEDING	From a breeding standpoint, multiple trait integration (MTI) is a four-step process of converting an elite variety/hybrid for value-added traits (e.g. transgenic events) using backcross breeding, ultimately regaining the performance attributes of the target hybrid along with reliable expression of the value-added traits. In the light of the overarching goal of recovering equivalent performance in the finished conversion, this study focuses on the first step of MTI, single event introgression, exploring the feasibility of marker-aided backcross conversion of a target maize hybrid for 15 transgenic events, incorporating eight events into the female hybrid parent and seven into the male parent. Single event introgression is conducted in parallel streams to convert the recurrent parent (RP) for individual events, with the primary objective of minimizing residual non-recurrent parent (NRP) germplasm, especially in the chromosomal proximity to the event (i.e. linkage drag). In keeping with a defined lower limit of 96.66 % overall RP germplasm recovery (i.e. a parts per thousand currency sign120 cM NRP germplasm given a genome size of 1,788 cM), a breeding goal for each of the 15 single event conversions was developed: < 8 cM of residual NRP germplasm across the genome with similar to 1 cM in the 20 cM region flanking the event. Using computer simulation, we aimed to identify optimal breeding strategies for single event introgression to achieve this breeding goal, measuring efficiency in terms of number of backcross generations required, marker data points needed, and total population size across generations. Various selection schemes classified as three-stage, modified two-stage, and combined selection conducted from BC1 through BC3, BC4, or BC5 were compared. The breeding goal was achieved with a selection scheme involving five generations of marker-aided backcrossing, with BC1 through BC3 selected for the event of interest and minimal linkage drag at population size of 600, and BC4 and BC5 selected for the event of interest and recovery of the RP germplasm across the genome at population size of 400, with selection intensity of 0.01 for all generations. In addition, strategies for choice of donor parent to facilitate conversion efficiency and quality were evaluated. Two essential criteria for choosing an optimal donor parent for a given RP were established: introgression history showing reduction of linkage drag to similar to 1 cM in the 20 cM region flanking the event and genetic similarity between the RP and potential donor parents. Computer simulation demonstrated that single event conversions with < 8 cM residual NRP germplasm can be accomplished by BC5 with no genetic similarity, by BC4 with 30 % genetic similarity, and by BC3 with 86 % genetic similarity using previously converted RPs as event donors. This study indicates that MTI to produce a 'quality' 15-event-stacked hybrid conversion is achievable. Furthermore, it lays the groundwork for a comprehensive approach to MTI by outlining a pathway to produce appropriate starting materials with which to proceed with event pyramiding and trait fixation before version testing.	2014	10.1007/s11032-013-9936-7		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Supple, Megan; Papa, Riccardo; Counterman, Brian; McMillan, W. Owen	The Genomics of an Adaptive Radiation: Insights Across the Heliconius Speciation Continuum	ECOLOGICAL GENOMICS: ECOLOGY AND THE EVOLUTION OF GENES AND GENOMES	Fueled by new technologies that allow rapid and inexpensive assessment of fine scale individual genomic variation, researchers are making transformational discoveries at the interface between genomes and biological complexity. Here we review genomic research in Heliconius butterflies - a radiation characterized by extraordinary phenotypic diversity in warningly colored wing patterns and composed of a continuum of taxa across the stages of speciation. These characteristics, coupled with a 50-year legacy of ecological and behavioral research, offer exceptional prospects for genomic studies into the nature of adaptive differences and the formation of new species. Research in Heliconius provides clear connections between genotype, phenotype, and fitness of wing color patterns shown to underlie adaptation and speciation. This research is challenging our perceptions about how speciation occurs in the presence of gene flow and the role of hybridization in generating adaptive novelty. With the release of the first Heliconius genome assembly, emerging genomic studies are painting a dynamic picture of the evolving species boundary. As the field of speciation genomics moves beyond describing patterns, towards a more integrated understanding of the process of speciation, groups such as Heliconius, where there is a clear speciation continuum and the traits underlying adaptation and speciation are known, will provide a roadmap for identifying variation crucial in the origins of biodiversity.	2014	10.1007/978-94-007-7347-9__13	10.1007/978-94-007-7347-9	Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
vonHoldt, Bridgett M.; Brzeski, Kristin E.; Wilcove, David S.; Rutledge, Linda Y.	Redefining the Role of Admixture and Genomics in Species Conservation	CONSERVATION LETTERS	The generation of genome-wide sequence data has brought with it both exciting opportunities for conservation and challenges for determining appropriate management practices in the face of complex evolutionary histories. Genomic data can provide deep insight into taxa with complex evolutionary origins, and is a powerful tool for biologists to obtain a more complete view of ancestry. Many policy decisions are encumbered by patterns of gene flow between species that reveal complex evolutionary histories. Here, we review conservation decisions in admixed species and highlight genomics research that demonstrates the commonality of hybridization in wildlife. We encourage a shift toward a web-of-life framework with emphasis on the need to incorporate flexibility in conservation practices by establishing a policy for lineages of admixed ancestry. In particular, we promote a conceptual framework under which hybridization, even extensive hybridization, no longer disqualifies a species from protection; instead, we encourage customized case-by-case management to protect evolutionary potential and maintain processes that sustain ecosystems.	2018	10.1111/conl.12371		prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Yeaman, Sam	Hybridization and the porous genome: patterns of isolation and introgression in manakins	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	How does one species become two? What is the relative importance of selection vs. drift? How many genes are involved, what are their effect sizes and where are they located in the genome? The answers to these questions will inevitably vary from one species to another, but by addressing these questions in a diverse array of taxa, we will gradually piece together a more complete picture of how evolution works. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman etal. () have approached these questions by studying the genomic basis of differentiation along a hybrid zone between two Central American bird species, the golden-collared (Manacus vitellinus) and white-collared (Manacus candei) manakins (see Fig.). Their work presents an interesting window into the evolution of this hybrid zone using novel analysis tools and a nice example of how to approach the study of population genomics in nonmodel organisms.	2013	10.1111/mec.12314		Prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Molnar-Lang, Marta; Linc, Gabriella; Szakacs, Eva	Wheat-barley hybridization: the last 40 years	EUPHYTICA	Several useful alien gene transfers have been reported from related species into wheat (Triticum aestivum), but very few publications have dealt with the development of wheat/barley (Hordeum vulgare) introgression lines. An overview is given here of wheat x barley hybridization over the last forty years, including the development of wheat x barley hybrids, and of addition and translocation lines with various barley cultivars. A short summary is also given of the wheat x barley hybrids produced with other Hordeum species. The meiotic pairing behaviour of wheat x barley hybrids is presented, with special regard to the detection of wheat-barley homoeologous pairing using the molecular cytogenetic technique GISH. The effect of in vitro multiplication on the genome composition of intergeneric hybrids is discussed, and the production and characterization of the latest wheat/barley translocation lines are presented. An overview of the agronomical traits (beta-glucan content, earliness, salt tolerance, sprouting resistance, etc.) of the newly developed introgression lines is given. The exploitation and possible use of wheat/barley introgression lines for the most up-to-date molecular genetic studies (transcriptome analysis, sequencing of flow-sorted chromosomes) are also discussed.	2014	10.1007/s10681-013-1009-9		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

However, the dynamics of this genetic exchange and associated phenotypic consequences through time remain poorly understood. Gene exchange across divergent lineages can result in myriad outcomes arising from these dynamics and the environmental conditions under which it occurs. Here we draw from our collective research across various organisms, illustrating some of the ways in which gene exchange can structure genomic/phenotypic diversity within/among species. We present a range of examples relevant to questions about the evolution of hominins. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather illustrative of the diverse evolutionary causes/consequences of hybridization, highlighting potential drivers of human evolution in the context of hybridization including: influences on adaptive evolution, climate change, developmental systems, sex-differences in behavior, Haldane's rule and the large X-effect, and transgressive phenotypic variation.	2019	10.1002/evan.21787		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Baack, Eric J.; Rieseberg, Loren H.	A genomic view of introgression and hybrid speciation	CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT	Hybridization in plants and animals is more common and has more complex outcomes than previously realized. Genome-wide analyses of introgression in organisms ranging from oaks to sunflowers to fruit flies show that a substantial fraction of their genomes are permeable to alleles from related species. Hybridization can lead to rapid genomic changes, including chromosomal rearrangements, genome expansion, differential gene expression, and gene silencing, some of which are mediated by transposable elements. These genomic changes may lead to beneficial new phenotypes, and selection for fertility and ecological traits may in turn alter genome structure. Dramatic increases in the availability of genomic tools will produce a new understanding of the genetic nature of species and will resolve a century-old debate over the basis of hybrid vigor, while the natural recombinants found in hybrid zones will permit genetic mapping of species differences and reproductive barriers in nonmodel organisms.	2007	10.1016/j.gde.2007.09.001		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Brower, Andrew V. Z.	Introgression of wing pattern alleles and speciation via homoploid hybridization in Heliconius butterflies: a review of evidence from the genome	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	The diverse Mullerian mimetic wing patterns of neotropical Heliconius (Nymphalidae) have been proposed to be not only aposematic signals to potential predators, but also intra- and interspecific recognition signals that allow the butterflies to maintain their specific identities, and which perhaps drive the process of speciation, as well. Adaptive features under differential selection that also serve as cues for assortative mating have been referred to as 'magic traits', which can drive ecological speciation. Such traits are expected to exhibit allelic differentiation between closely related species with ongoing gene flow, whereas unlinked neutral traits are expected to be homogenized to a greater degree by introgression. However, recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization among Heliconius butterflies may have resulted in adaptive introgression of these very same traits across species boundaries, and in the evolution of new species by homoploid hybrid speciation. The theory and data supporting various aspects of the apparent paradox of 'magic trait' introgression are reviewed, with emphasis on population genomic comparisons of Heliconius melpomene and its close relatives.	2013	10.1098/rspb.2012.2302		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Curwen-McAdams, Colin; Jones, Stephen S.	Breeding Perennial Grain Crops Based on Wheat	CROP SCIENCE	Wild relatives offer a diversity of traits potentially useful in crop improvement. Identification of major genes for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, in conjunction with targeted introgression, has introduced some of these traits into cultivated varieties. The difficulty of transferring complex traits, and associated linkage drag, has limited the ability of breeding programs to fully use important genetic variation. Wheat (Triticum L.) is an example of an important crop with large secondary and tertiary genepools of species capable of producing viable offspring by cross pollination. Wheat is annual, but most of the related species in the Triticeae Dumort tribe are perennials. An unknown number of genes control the perennial habit, although previous work has shown that it is a complex trait with quantitative expression. Lack of recombination between the parental genomes and complexity of the trait suggest another avenue for breeding: the addition of a genome. Multiple genera can hybridize with wheat, and some combinations produce stable amphiploids. The development of perennial grain and forage crops balancing the agronomics of wheat with the polycarpic habit of its relatives is promising. The approach is similar to Triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack ex A. Camus), where new crops are developed combining the desirable qualities of the parents. Through prebreeding of the wild relatives, application of insight into meiosis, and strategic use of known genes, it should be more efficient to breed perennial grain crops adapted to diverse production systems.	2017	10.2135/cropsci2016.10.0869		Review			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
de los Reyes, Benildo G.	Genomic and epigenomic bases of transgressive segregation - New breeding it paradigm for novel plant phenotypes	PLANT SCIENCE	For a holistic approach in developing the stress-resilient crops of the 21st century, modern genomic biology will need to re-envision the underappreciated phenomena in classical genetics, and incorporate them into the new plant breeding paradigm. Advances in evolutionary genomics support a theory that genetic recombination under genome shock during hybridization of widely divergent parents is an important driver of adaptive speciation, by virtue of the novelties of rare hybrids and recombinants. The enormous potential of genetic network rewiring to generate developmental or physiological novelties with adaptive advantage to special ecological niches has been appreciated. Developmental and physiological reconfiguration through network rewiring involves intricate molecular synergies controlled both at the genetic and epigenetic levels, as typified by the phenomenon of transgressive segregation, observed in both natural and breeding populations. This paper presents modern views on the possible molecular underpinnings of transgressive phenotypes as they are created in plant breeding, expanded from classical explanations through the Omnigenic Theory for quantitative traits and modern paradigms of epigenetics. Perspectives on how genomic biology can fully exploit this phenomenon to create novel phenotypes beyond what could be achieved through the more reductionist approach of functional genomics are presented in context of genomic modeling.	2019	10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.110213		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Eeckhaut, Tom; Lakshmanan, Prabhu Shankar; Deryckere, Dieter; Van Bockstaele, Erik; Van Huylenbroeck, Johan	Progress in plant protoplast research	PLANTA	In this review we focus on recent progress in protoplast regeneration, symmetric and asymmetric hybridization and novel technology developments. Regeneration of new species and improved culture techniques opened new horizons for practical breeding in a number of crops. The importance of protoplast sources and embedding systems is discussed. The study of reactive oxygen species effects and DNA (de)condensation, along with thorough phytohormone monitoring, are in our opinion the most promising research topics in the further strive for rationalization of protoplast regeneration. Following, fusion and fragmentation progress is summarized. Genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic studies have led to better insights in fundamental processes such as cell wall formation, cell development and chromosome rearrangements in fusion products, whether or not obtained after irradiation. Advanced molecular screening methods of both genome and cytoplasmome facilitate efficient screening of both symmetric and asymmetric fusion products. We expect that emerging technologies as GISH, high resolution melting and next generation sequencing will pay major contributions to our insights of genome creation and stabilization, mainly after asymmetric hybridization. Finally, we demonstrate agricultural valorization of somatic hybridization through enumerating recent introgression of diverse traits in a number of commercial crops.	2013	10.1007/s00425-013-1936-7		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Feurtey, Alice; Stukenbrock, Eva H.	Interspecific Gene Exchange as a Driver of Adaptive Evolution in Fungi	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY, VOL 72	Throughout evolutionary history in the kingdom Fungi, taxa have exchanged genetic information among species, as revealed in particular by analyses of genome sequences. In fungi, hybridization can occur by sexual mating or by fusion of vegetative structures giving rise to new species or leaving traces of introgression in the genome. Furthermore, gene exchange can occur by horizontal gene transfer between species and can even include organisms outside the kingdom Fungi. In several cases, interspecific gene exchange has been instrumental in rapid adaptive evolution of fungal species and has notably played a role in the emergence of new pathogens. Here we summarize mechanisms and examples of gene exchange in fungi with a particular focus on the genomic context. We emphasize the need for and potential of applying population genetic approaches to better understand the processes and the impact of interspecific gene exchange in rapid adaptive evolution and species diversification. The broad occurrence of gene exchange among fungal species challenges our species concepts in the kingdom Fungi.	2018	10.1146/annurev-micro-090817-062753		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Gaiero, Paola; Speranza, Pablo; de Jong, Hans	Introgressive Hybridization in Potato Revealed by Novel Cytogenetic and Genomic Technologies	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POTATO RESEARCH	Potato is the third most important food crop in the world and is crucial to ensure food security. However, increasing biotic and abiotic stresses jeopardize its stable production. Fortunately, breeders count on a rich pool of wild relatives that provide sources for disease resistance and tolerance to environmental stresses. To use such traits effectively, breeders require tools that facilitate exploration and exploitation of the genetic diversity of potato wild relatives. Introgression programs to incorporate such alien chromatin into the crop have so far relied on cytogenetic and genetic studies to tap desired traits from these wild resources. The available genetic and cytogenetic tools, supplemented with more recent genomic technologies, can assist in the use of potato relatives in pre-breeding. This information can also facilitate cisgenesis and genome editing to improve potato cultivars. Despite the abundant and rapidly growing genomic information of potato, that of its wild relatives is still limited.

Gompert, Zachariah; Parchman, Thomas L.; Buerkle, C. Alex	Genomics of isolation in hybrids	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Hybrid zones are common in nature and can offer critical insights into the dynamics and components of reproductive isolation. Hybrids between diverged lineages are particularly informative about the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation, because introgression in an admixed population is a direct measure of isolation. In this paper, we combine simulations and a new statistical model to determine the extent to which different genetic architectures of isolation leave different signatures on genome-level patterns of introgression. We found that reproductive isolation caused by one or several loci of large effect caused greater heterogeneity in patterns of introgression than architectures involving many loci with small fitness effects, particularly when isolating factors were closely linked. The same conditions that led to heterogeneous introgression often resulted in a reasonable correspondence between outlier loci and the genetic loci that contributed to isolation. However, demographic conditions affected both of these results, highlighting potential limitations to the study of the speciation genomics. Further progress in understanding the genomics of speciation will require large-scale empirical studies of introgression in hybrid zones and model-based analyses, as well as more comprehensive modelling of the expected levels of isolation with different demographies and genetic architectures of isolation.	2012	10.1098/rstb.2011.0196		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Harrison, Richard G.; Larson, Erica L.	Hybridization, Introgression, and the Nature of Species Boundaries	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY	Species can be defined as populations that are diagnosably distinct, reproductively isolated, cohesive, or exclusive groups of organisms. Boundaries between species in sympatry are maintained by intrinsic barriers to gene exchange; these boundaries may not be uniform in space, in time, or across the genome. Here, we explore the nature of the species boundary, defined as the phenotypes/genes/genome regions that remain differentiated in the face of potential hybridization and introgression. We emphasize that species boundaries are semipermeable, with permeability (gene exchange) being a function of genome region. The early evidence for semipermeable species boundaries came from data on differential introgression in hybrid zones. This "genic view" of species was common in the hybrid zone literature even when few molecular markers were available to characterize genome-wide patterns of variation. Now, molecular tools allow detailed characterization of differentiation between diverging lineages and patterns of variation across natural hybrid zones, but the questions being asked by evolutionary biologists have remained much the same. Recent data (from DNA sequences and genotypes) reinforce earlier conclusions about the semipermeable nature of most species boundaries. However, debate persists over the nature and extent of genome divergence that accompanies speciation.	2014	10.1093/jhered/esu033		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Hill, Geoffrey E.	Reconciling the Mitonuclear Compatibility Species Concept with Rampant Mitochondrial Introgression	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY	The mitonuclear compatibility species concept defines a species as a population that is genetically isolated from other populations by uniquely coadapted mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear genes. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that the mt genotype of each species will be functionally distinct and that introgression of mt genomes will be prevented by mitonuclear incompatibilities that arise when heterospecific mt and nuclear genes attempt to cofunction to enable aerobic respiration. It has been proposed, therefore, that the observation of rampant introgression of mt genotypes from one species to another constitutes a strong refutation of the mitonuclear speciation. The displacement of a mt genotype from a nuclear background with which it co-evolved to a foreign nuclear background will necessarily lead to fitness loss due to mitonuclear incompatibilities. Here I consider two potential benefits of mt introgression between species that may, in some cases, overcome fitness losses arising from mitonuclear incompatibilities. First, the introgressed mt genotype may be better adapted to the local environment than the native mt genotype such that higher fitness is achieved through improved adaptation via introgression. Second, if the mitochondria of the recipient taxa carry a high mutational load, then introgression of a foreign, less corrupt mt genome may enable the recipient taxa to escape its mutational load and gain a fitness advantage. Under both scenarios, fitness gains from novel mt genotypes could theoretically compensate for the fitness that is lost via mitonuclear incompatibility. I also consider the role of endosymbionts in non-adaptive rampant introgression of mt genomes. I conclude that rampant introgression is not necessarily evidence against the idea of tight mitonuclear coadaptation or the mitonuclear compatibility species concept. Rampant mt introgression will typically lead to erasure of species but in some cases could lead to hybrid speciation.	2019	10.1093/icb/icz019		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Jindal, Salesh Kumar; Dhaliwal, Major Singh; Meena, Om Prakash	Molecular advancements in male sterility systems of Capsicum: A review	PLANT BREEDING	In recent years, plant molecular research on genetic mapping, gene tagging and cloning, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) have gained importance in crop improvement programmes. In Capsicum, several inter- and intra-specific genetic maps with wide distribution of markers covering the whole genome have been developed. Recently, whole genome of the hot pepper C. annuum, its wild progenitor C. annuum var. glabriusculum and C. baccatum has been sequenced. The Capsicum genome size has been estimated to be approx. 4x (3.48 Gb) the genome size of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) (900 Mb). Breeders' access to the pepper genomic information would facilitate the choice of markers from different linkage groups, thus paving the way for gene cloning and its introgression into the elite breeding lines through MAS. Till date, approx. 20 independently inherited nuclear male sterility (NMS) genes have been reported. Linked markers have been identified for ms1, ms3, ms8, ms10, ms(k), msc-1 and an undesignated gene. However, markers tightly linked to ms8 and ms10 are still lacking. Except ms1, ms3, ms8 and ms10, the map position of other NMS genes is not known. In cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS), markers for the mitochondrial gene atp6 have been developed and the gene cloned. Number of markers some very tightly linked to the restorer-of-fertility (Rf) gene have been identified. However, the actual map position of the Rf locus is still not determined. Another CMS-associated nuclear gene "pr" responsible for restoring partial fertility has been identified and tagged. In this review, we have compiled up-to-date information about the marker technology relating to the NMS and the CMS-associated genes in Capsicum. This information can be useful when screening Capsicum germplasm, developing NMS lines through MAS, improving efficiency of the NMS system, transferring rf gene for maintainer line breeding and Rf genes for restorer line breeding in CMS and assessing genetic purity of the hybrid seed.	2020	10.1111/pbr.12757		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Kuligowska, Katarzyna; Lutken, Henrik; Mueller, Renate	Towards development of new ornamental plants: status and progress in wide hybridization	PLANTA	The present review provides insights into the key findings of the hybridization process, crucial factors affecting the adaptation of new technologies within wide hybridization of ornamental plants and presents perspectives of further development of this strategy. Wide hybridization is one of the oldest breeding techniques that contributed enormously to the development of modern plant cultivars. Within ornamental breeding, it represents the main source of genetic variation. During the long history of wide hybridization, a number of methods were implemented allowing the evolution from a conventional breeding tool into a modern methodology. Nowadays, the research on model plants and crop species increases our understanding of reproductive isolation among distant species and partly explains the background of the traditional approaches previously used for overcoming hybridization barriers. Characterization of parental plants and hybrids is performed using molecular and cytological techniques that strongly facilitate breeding processes. Molecular markers and sequencing technologies are used for the assessment of genetic relationships among plants, as the genetic distance is typically depicted as one of the most important factors influencing cross-compatibility in hybridization processes. Furthermore, molecular marker systems are frequently applied for verification of hybrid state of the progeny. The flow cytometry and genomic in situ hybridization are used in the assessment of hybridization partners and characterization of hybrid progeny in relation to genome stabilization as well as genome recombination and introgression. In the future, new research and technologies are likely to provide more detailed information about genes and pathways responsible for interspecific reproductive isolation. Ultimately, this knowledge will enable development of strategies for obtaining compatible lines for hybrid production. Recent development in sequencing technologies and availability of sequence data will also facilitate creation of new molecular markers that will advance marker-assisted selection in hybridization process.	2016	10.1007/s00425-016-2493-7		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Kwiatek, Michal T.; Nawracala, Jerzy	Chromosome manipulations for progress of triticale (xTriticosecale) breeding	PLANT BREEDING	In this review, we present the current state of knowledge and directions of future prebreeding studies of hexaploid triticale concerning chromosome manipulations. We specify the main goals for creating chromosome aberrations in this artificially generated crop, which are referred to as introgression of genes that are responsible for quality traits, biotic stresses resistance, and heterosis. We discuss the breeding methods, supported by cytomolecular analyses, which are based on development of chromosome aberrations induced by meiotic restitution, chromosome elimination, chromosome fragmentation or random fusion of chromatin fragments into chromosome structures. What is more, this kind of chromosome manipulations can be generated through induced cross-hybridizations, which are alternatives to genome editing technologies, associated with the production of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We also show the newest modifications and improvements in triticale breeding strategies, which involve recent achievements in cytogenetics and genomics. At last, we discuss how the new methods, such as gametocidal factor system or induced homoeologous recombination, can be exploited to accelerate the breeding considering particular end-use properties of triticale.	2018	10.1111/pbr.12652		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Mallet, J	Hybridization as an invasion of the genome	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	Hybridization between species is commonplace in plants, but is often seen as unnatural and unusual in animals. Here, I survey studies of natural interspecific hybridization in plants and a variety of animals. At least 25% of plant species and 10% of animal species, mostly the youngest species, are involved in hybridization and potential introgression with other species. Species in nature are often incompletely isolated for millions of years after their formation. Therefore, much evolution of eventual reproductive isolation can occur while nascent species are in gene-flow contact, in sympatry or parapatry, long after divergence begins. Although the relative importance of geographic isolation and gene flow in the origin of species is still unknown, many key processes involved in speciation, such as 'reinforcement' of post-mating isolation by the evolution of assortative mating, will have ample opportunity to occur in the presence of continuing gene flow. Today, DNA sequence data and other molecular methods are beginning to show that limited invasions of the genome are widespread, with potentially important consequences in evolutionary biology, speciation, biodiversity, and conservation.	2005	10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.010		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Detecting the True Extent of Introgression during Anthropogenic Hybridization	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	Hybridization among naturally separate taxa is increasing owing to human impact, and can result in taxon loss.

Genetic markers can be used to detect such hybrids, but until recently too few markers have been used to detect the true extent of introgression. Recent studies of wolves and trout have employed thousands of markers to reveal previously undetectable backcrosses. This improved resolution will lead to increased detection of late-generation backcrosses, shed light on the consequences of anthropogenic hybridization, and pose new management issues for conservation scientists.	2019	10.1016/j.tree.2018.12.013		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Mehboob-ur-Rahman; Shaheen, Tayyaba; Tabbasam, Nabila; Iqbal, Muhammad Atif; Ashraf, Muhammad; Zafar, Yusuf; Paterson, Andrew H.	Cotton genetic resources. A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT	Since 6000 BC, cotton has been cultivated for lint fiber, which now dominates the natural textile industry worldwide. Common resources such as an integrated web database, a microsatellite database, and comparative quantitative trait loci (QTL) resources for Gossypium have accelerated the progress towards quantifying the impact of repeated human dispersals and selection regimes on various gene pools of the genus Gossypium. Out of 50 Gossypium species, four have been domesticated-two diploids and two tetraploids-for elimination of hard seed coat, improvement in lint percentage of about 40% and fiber length of 22%, larger boll size, and day-neutral reproductive habit. The major drawback of domestication is the lack of genetic diversity. This lack of genetic diversity is observed more in Gossypium hirsutum L. cultivars characterizing upland cotton than in Gossypium barbadense, typical of Pima and Egyptian cotton. Much of the genetic diversity among G. barbadense cultivars is attributed to the introgression of G. hirsutum alleles. This process highlights the importance of introgression of new alleles from accessions of all the Gossypium species into cultivated cotton species. Among the genomic resources, about 16,162 publicly available SSRs and 312 mapped cotton RFLP sequences containing simple sequence repeat (SSR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers have been surveyed on numerous mapping populations, and developed about 26 linkage maps (SSR, RFLP, AFLP, and RAPD). Reports show the identification of DNA markers associated with over 29 important traits or QTLs such as fiber quality and yield, leaf and flower morphology, trichome density and their distribution, and disease resistance. In comparative mapping studies, 432 QTLs mapped on 11 different mapping populations were aligned on a high-density reference map containing 3,475 loci. In a meta-analysis study of over 1,000 QTLs obtained from backcross population and recombinant inbred line populations derived from the same parents, most consistent meta-clusters were reported for fiber color, fineness, and length. For exploring the function of genes, the targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) approach-avoiding gene transfer process was used for identifying a brassino steroid receptor gene that is involved in fiber development. Lastly, cotton genome has been enriched with genes isolated from distantly related organisms using various transformation methods. For example, Cry1Ac, Cry1Ab, and herbicide-resistant genes were transformed in cotton that covered a vast majority of cotton acreage worldwide. Here the authors discuss investigations for improving the efficacy of transformation and regeneration systems, and for searching new genes or silencing the unwanted cotton genes using RNAi technology. We suggest initiating projects on sequencing the diploid and tetraploid genomes for exploring the extent of genetic variations, developing TILLING populations, initiating nested association mapping studies, and developing third generation genetically modified cotton, collectively setting the stage for sustaining cotton production under continually changing production conditions, climates, and human needs.	2012	10.1007/s13593-011-0051-z		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Nolte, Arne W.; Tautz, Diethard	Understanding the onset of hybrid speciation	TRENDS IN GENETICS	Natural hybridization between closely related taxa is a common phenomenon in both plants and animals. Hybridization has often been viewed as a destructive force that could erode established gene pools, but it is increasingly being recognized as a potentially creative force in evolution because it can lead to a mixture of novel genotypes, some of which have the potential for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. However, the evolutionary dynamics leading to the emergence of newly adapted gene pools after hybridization are largely unexplored. Here, we argue that the identification and analysis of the dynamic processes that occur after the first contact deserve specific attention, because this is the phase where hybrid speciation is most different from other forms of speciation.	2010	10.1016/j.tig.2009.12.001		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Noor, M. A. F.; Bennett, S. M.	Islands of speciation or mirages in the desert? Examining the role of restricted recombination in maintaining species	HEREDITY	Over the past decade, many studies documented high genetic divergence between closely related species in genomic regions experiencing restricted recombination in hybrids, such as within chromosomal rearrangements or areas adjacent to centromeres. Such regions have been called 'islands of speciation' because of their presumed role in maintaining the integrity of species despite gene flow elsewhere in the genome. Here, we review alternative explanations for such patterns. Segregation of ancestral variation or artifacts of nucleotide diversity within species can readily lead to higher F-ST in regions of restricted recombination than other parts of the genome, even in the complete absence of interspecies gene flow, and thereby cause investigators to erroneously conclude that islands of speciation exist. We conclude by discussing strengths and weaknesses of various means for testing the role of restricted recombination in maintaining species.

Ottenburghs, Jente	Exploring the hybrid speciation continuum in birds	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a creative evolutionary force contributing to adaptation and speciation. Homoploid hybrid speciation-the process in which hybridization results in a stable, fertile, and reproductively isolated hybrid lineage where there is no change in ploidy-has been documented in several taxa. Hybridization can directly contribute to reproductive isolation or reinforce it at a later stage. Alternatively, hybridization might not be related to the evolution of reproductive isolation. To account for these different scenarios, I propose to discriminate between two types of hybrid speciation: type I where reproductive isolation is a direct consequence of hybridization and type II where it is the by-product of other processes. I illustrate the applicability of this classification scheme with avian examples. To my knowledge, seven hybrid bird species have been proposed: Italian sparrow, Audubon's warbler, Genovesa mockingbird, Hawaiian duck, red-breasted goose, golden-crowned manakin, and a recent lineage of Darwin's finches on the island of Daphne Major ("Big Bird"). All studies provide convincing evidence for hybridization, but do not always confidently discriminate between scenarios of hybrid speciation and recurrent introgressive hybridization. The build-up of reproductive isolation between the hybrid species and their parental taxa is mainly driven by premating isolation mechanisms and comparable to classical speciation events. One hybrid species can be classified as type I ("Big Bird") while three species constitute type II hybrid species (Italian sparrow, Audubon's warbler, and golden-crowned manakin). The diversity in hybrid bird species across a range of divergence times also provides an excellent opportunity to study the evolution of hybrid genomes in terms of genome stabilization and adaptation.	2018	10.1002/ece3.4558		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Ottenburghs, Jente; Kraus, Robert H. S.; van Hooft, Pim; van Wieren, Sipke E.; Ydenberg, Ronald C.; Prins, Herbert H. T.	Avian introgression in the genomic era	AVIAN RESEARCH	Introgression, the incorporation of genetic material from one (sub) species into the gene pool of another by means of hybridization and backcrossing, is a common phenomenon in birds and can provide important insights into the speciation process. In the last decade, the toolkit for studying introgression has expanded together with the development of molecular markers. In this review, we explore how genomic data, the most recent step in this methodological progress, impacts different aspects in the study of avian introgression. First, the detection of hybrids and backcrosses has improved dramatically. The most widely used software package is STRUCTURE. Phylogenetic discordance (i.e. different loci resulting in discordant gene trees) is another means for the detection of introgression, although it should be regarded as a starting point for further analyses, not as a definitive proof of introgression. Specifically, disentangling introgression from other biological processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting, remains a challenging endeavour, although new techniques, such as the D-statistic, are being developed. In addition, phylogenetics might require a shift from trees to networks. Second, the study of hybrid zones by means of geographical or genomic cline analysis has led to important insights into the complex interplay between hybridization and speciation. However, because each hybrid zone study is just a single snapshot of a complex and continuously changing interaction, hybrid zones should be studied across different temporal and/or spatial scales. A third powerful tool is the genome scan. The debate on which evolutionary processes underlie the genomic landscape is still ongoing, as is the question whether loci involved in reproductive isolation cluster together in 'islands of speciation' or whether they are scattered throughout the genome. Exploring genomic landscapes across the avian tree of life will be an exciting field for further research. Finally, the findings from these different methods should be incorporated into specific speciation scenarios, which can consequently be tested using a modelling approach. All in all, this genomic perspective on avian hybridization and speciation will further our understanding in evolution in general.	2017	10.1186/s40657-017-0088-z		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Payseur, Bret A.	Using differential introgression in hybrid zones to identify genomic regions involved in speciation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES	Hybrids between species provide information about the evolutionary processes involved in divergence. In addition to creating hybrids in the laboratory, biologists can take advantage of natural hybrid zones to understand the factors that shape gene flow between divergent lineages. In the early stages of speciation, most regions of the genome continue to flow freely between populations. Alternatively, the subset of the genome that confers reproductive barriers between nascent species is expected to reject introgression. Now enabled by advances in genomics, this perspective is motivating detailed comparisons of gene flow across genomic regions in hybrid zones. Here, I review methods for measuring and interpreting introgression at multiple loci in hybrid zones, focusing on the problem of identifying loci that contribute to reproductive isolation. Emerging patterns from multi-locus studies of hybrid zones are highlighted, including remarkable variance in introgression across the genome. Although existing methods have been useful, there is scope for development of new analytical approaches that better connect differential patterns of gene flow in hybrid zones with current knowledge of speciation mechanisms. I outline future prospects for differential introgression studies on a genomic scale.	2010	10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02883.x		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Hybridization, sex-specific genomic architecture and local adaptation	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	While gene flow can reduce the potential for local adaptation, hybridization may conversely provide genetic variation that increases the potential for local adaptation. Hybridization may also affect adaptation through altering sexual dimorphism and sexual conflict, but this remains largely unstudied. Here, we discuss how hybridization may affect sexual dimorphism and conflict due to differential effects of hybridization on males and females, and then how this, in turn, may affect local adaptation. First, in species with heterochromatic sexes, the lower viability of the heterogametic sex in hybrids could shift the balance in sexual conflict. Second, sex-specific inheritance of the mitochondrial genome in hybrids may lead to cytonuclear mismatches, for example, in the form of 'mother's curse', with potential consequences for sex ratio and sex-specific expression. Third, sex-biased introgression and recombination may lead to sex-specific consequences of hybridization. Fourth, transgressive segregation of sexually antagonistic alleles could increase sexual dimorphism in hybrid populations. Sexual dimorphism can reduce sexual conflict and enhance intersexual niche partitioning, increasing the fitness of hybrids. Adaptive introgression of alleles reducing sexual conflict or enhancing intersexual niche partitioning may facilitate local adaptation, and could favour the colonization of novel habitats. We review these consequences of hybridization on sex differences and local adaptation, and discuss how their prevalence and importance could be tested empirically. This article is part of the theme issue 'Linking local adaptation with the evolution of sex differences'.	2018	10.1098/rstb.2017.0419		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

The genomic revolution has shown that is common, and that it may represent an important source of novel . Although most interspecific hybrids are or less fit than their parents, some may survive and reproduce, enabling the of adaptive variants across the species boundary, and even result in the formation of novel . There are two main variants of hybrid species genomes: , which have one full from each parent species, and homoploid, which are a of the parent species genomes with no increase in chromosome number. The establishment of hybrid species requires the development of against parental species. Allopolyploid species often have strong intrinsic reproductive barriers due to differences in chromosome number, and homoploid hybrids can become reproductively isolated from the parent species through assortment of genetic incompatibilities. However, both types of hybrids can become further reproductively isolated, gaining extrinsic isolation barriers, by exploiting novel , relative to their parents. Hybrids represent the merging of divergent genomes and thus face problems arising from incompatible combinations of genes. Thus hybrid genomes are highly dynamic and undergo rapid evolutionary change, including genome stabilization in which selection against incompatible combinations results in of compatible ancestry block combinations within the hybrid species. The potential for rapid or makes hybrid genomes a particularly exciting subject of in evolutionary biology. Here we summarize how or hybrid species can establish and how the resulting hybrid genomes evolve.	2019	10.1371/journal.pgen.1008404		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

The drivers and methodologies for exploiting wild Cajanus genome in pigeonpea breeding	EUPHYTICA	With the exception of Cajanus cajan (L.) Millspaugh (pigeonpea), the remaining species of genus Cajanus have not been domesticated. For millennia these taxa have persisted in natural habitats through self-sown seeds. These wild species are an asset for sustaining future pigeonpea breeding programmes since they contain certain traits (genes) that are necessary for encountering various breeding challenges related to crop improvement and adaptation. In this review we identify the key traits from wild Cajanus species, and discuss various physical and genetic constraints encountered in their utilization in introgression breeding. Some noteworthy achievements recorded from inter-specific breeding programmes in pigeonpea are also discussed. These include the development of (1) high protein (>28%) genotypes (2) cytoplasmic nuclear male sterility systems (3) highly (>95%) self-pollinating genotypes, and (4) resistance sources to sterility mosaic disease, nematodes, salinity, photo-insensitivity, pod borers, podfly, bruchids, and Phytophthora blight. To help pigeonpea breeders engaged in inter-specific breeding programmes, we suggest the division of the secondary gene pool germplasm into two sub-group/tiers on the basis of ease in hybridization.	2018	10.1007/s10681-018-2298-9		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Schwenk, Klaus; Brede, Nora; Streit, Bruno	Introduction. Extent, processes and evolutionary impact of interspecific hybridization in animals	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	Since the time of Charles Darwin, studies of interspecific hybridization have been a major focus for evolutionary biologists. Although this phenomenon has often been viewed as problematic in the fields of ecology, taxonomy and systematics, it has become a primary source of data for studies on speciation and adaptation. Effects from genetic/ evolutionary processes, such as recombination and natural selection, usually develop over extended periods of time; however, they are accelerated in cases of hybridization. Interspecific hybrids exhibit novel genomes that are exposed to natural selection, thus providing a key to unravel the ultimate causes of adaptation and speciation. Here we provide firstly a historic perspective of hybridization research, secondly a novel attempt to assess the extent of hybridization among animals and thirdly an overview of the reviews and case studies presented in this theme issue.	2008	10.1098/rstb.2008.0055		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Genomics-based strategies for the use of natural variation in the improvement of crop metabolism	PLANT SCIENCE	Next-generation genomics holds great potential in the study of plant phenotypic variation. With several crop reference genomes now available, the affordable costs of de nova genome assembly or target resequencing offer the opportunity to mine the enormous amount of genetic diversity hidden in crop wild relatives. Wide introgressions from these wild ancestors species or land races represent a possible strategy to improve cultivated varieties. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying metabolic diversity within plant species and the possible strategies (and barriers) to introgress novel metabolic traits into cultivated varieties. We show how deep genomic surveys uncover various types of structural variants from extended gene pools of major crops and highlight how this variation may be used for the improvement of crop metabolism.

Shapiro, B. Jesse; Leducq, Jean-Baptiste; Mallet, James	What Is Speciation?	PLOS GENETICS	Concepts and definitions of species have been debated by generations of biologists and remain controversial. Microbes pose a particular challenge because of their genetic diversity, asexual reproduction, and often promiscuous horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, microbes also present an opportunity to study and understand speciation because of their rapid evolution, both in nature and in the lab, and small, easily sequenced genomes. Here, we review how microbial population genomics has enabled us to catch speciation "in the act" and how the results have challenged and enriched our concepts of species, with implications for all domains of life. We describe how recombination (including HGT and introgression) has shaped the genomes of nascent microbial, animal, and plant species and argue for a prominent role of natural selection in initiating and maintaining speciation. We ask how universal is the process of speciation across the tree of life, and what lessons can be drawn from microbes? Comparative genomics showing the extent of HGT in natural populations certainly jeopardizes the relevance of vertical descent (i.e., the species tree) in speciation. Nevertheless, we conclude that species do indeed exist as clusters of genetic and ecological similarity and that speciation is driven primarily by natural selection, regardless of the balance between horizontal and vertical descent.	2016	10.1371/journal.pgen.1005860		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Shurtliff, Quinn R.	Mammalian hybrid zones: a review	MAMMAL REVIEW	A hybrid zone is a region where interbreeding occurs between two or more genetically distinct populations. Recent studies have shown that mammalian hybrid zones occur in nature more frequently than previously thought. I summarize the history of research on mammalian hybrid zones, highlighting contributions that demonstrate genetic, behavioural and environmental mechanisms responsible for spatial distribution of genotypes, maintenance or elimination of reproductive barriers and evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. The role of hybridization in mammalian evolution, adaptation and diversification is demonstrated by the existence of hybrid swarms (e.g. caribou) and species genesis via homoploid hybridization (e.g. primates, bats). Mammalian hybrid zones are ideal settings in which to investigate genetic mechanisms that influence mate preferences as well as other questions regarding sexual selection. Many evolutionary processes and mechanisms associated with sexual selection have been well demonstrated in primate, rodent and seal hybrid zones by combining behavioural and genetic, and environmental techniques. Investigations of interbreeding chromosomal races of mouse Mus musculus and shrew Sorex araneus provide insight into the role of chromosome rearrangements in the speciation process. The genomes of some mammals that hybridize in nature are fully sequenced, and rapid progress is being made towards understanding genetic underpinnings of phenotypes governing reproductive isolation. Future studies of mammalian hybrid zones will incorporate genomic techniques with increasing frequency and taxonomic representation. Such techniques may include examination of gene expression patterns using microarrays or large-scale analysis of introgression using markers from multiple genetic systems (e.g. mitochondria, sex chromosomes). As methods improve, researchers will be better positioned to advise managers and policy makers about the potential outcomes of hybridization. This may be increasingly important as previously isolated forms come into contact as a result of global climate change.	2013	10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00205.x		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Silva, G. S.; Souza, M. M.	Genomic in situ hybridization in plants	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH	Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), which is a modification of fluorescent in situ hybridization, has been widely used in the study of plants. It has become one of the most important techniques for molecular cytogenetics. GISH is a technique that allows distinguishing the genomes in a cell. With this technique, it is possible to differentiate the genomes in a hybrid; consequently, this tool has been applied to the study of hybrid lineages, genetic improvement programs, and studies of the evolution of polyploids. Moreover, GISH can be applied to the analysis of the meiotic behavior in hybrids and polyploids, providing information concerning the relationship between species. This review presents the wide application of this technique in plants.	2013	10.4238/2013.August.12.11		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Sloan, Daniel B.; Havird, Justin C.; Sharbrough, Joel	The on-again, off-again relationship between mitochondrial genomes and species boundaries	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	The study of reproductive isolation and species barriers frequently focuses on mitochondrial genomes and has produced two alternative and almost diametrically opposed narratives. On one hand, mtDNA may be at the forefront of speciation events, with co-evolved mitonuclear interactions responsible for some of the earliest genetic incompatibilities arising among isolated populations. On the other hand, there are numerous cases of introgression of mtDNA across species boundaries even when nuclear gene flow is restricted. We argue that these seemingly contradictory patterns can result from a single underlying cause. Specifically, the accumulation of deleterious mutations in mtDNA creates a problem with two alternative evolutionary solutions. In some cases, compensatory or epistatic changes in the nuclear genome may ameliorate the effects of mitochondrial mutations, thereby establishing coadapted mitonuclear genotypes within populations and forming the basis of reproductive incompatibilities between populations. Alternatively, populations with high mitochondrial mutation loads may be rescued by replacement with a more fit, foreign mitochondrial haplotype. Coupled with many nonadaptive mechanisms of introgression that can preferentially affect cytoplasmic genomes, this form of adaptive introgression may contribute to the widespread discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genealogies. Here, we review recent advances related to mitochondrial introgression and mitonuclear incompatibilities, including the potential for cointrogression of mtDNA and interacting nuclear genes. We also address an emerging controversy over the classic assumption that selection on mitochondrial genomes is inefficient and discuss the mechanisms that lead lineages down alternative evolutionary paths in response to mitochondrial mutation accumulation.	2017	10.1111/mec.13959		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Stalker, H. Thomas	Utilizing Wild Species for Peanut Improvement	CROP SCIENCE	The cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an allotetraploid species with a very large and complex genome. This species is susceptible to numerous foliar and soil-borne diseases for which only moderate levels of resistance have been identified in the germplasm collection, but several of the 81 wild species are extremely resistant to many destructive peanut diseases. Peanut species were grouped into nine sections, but only taxa in section Arachis will hybridize with A. hypogaea. Most of these species are diploid, but two aneuploids and two tetraploids also exist in the section. The first peanut cultivars released after interspecific hybridization were 'Spancross' and 'Tamnut 74' during the 1970s from a cross between A. hypogaea and its tetraploid progenitor. However, introgression of useful genes from diploids has been difficult due to sterility barriers resulting from genomic and ploidy differences. To utilize diploids in section Arachis, direct hybrids have been made between A. hypogaea and diploid species, the chromosome number doubled to the hexaploid level, and then tetraploids recovered with resistances to nematodes, leaf spots, rust, and numerous insect pests. 'Bailey', a widely grown Virginia-type peanut, was released from these materials, and other cultivars are gown in Asia and South America. Alternatively, hybrids between diploid A and B genome species have been made, the chromosome number doubled, and cultivars released with nematode resistance derived from Arachis species. Introgression from Arachis species to A. hypogaea appears to be in large blocks rather than as single genes, and new genotyping strategies should enhance utilization of wild peanut genetic resources.	2017	10.2135/cropsci2016.09.0824		Review			TRUE	TRUE	Introgression lines	FALSE			FALSE	
Taylor, Scott A.; Larson, Erica L.	Insights from genomes into the evolutionary importance and prevalence of hybridization in nature	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION	Hybridization is an evolutionary phenomenon that has fascinated biologists for centuries. Prior to the advent of whole-genome sequencing, it was clear that hybridization had played a role in the evolutionary history of many extant taxa, particularly plants. The extent to which hybridization has contributed to the evolution of Earth's biodiversity has, however, been the topic of much debate. Analyses of whole genomes are providing further insight into this evolutionary problem. Recent studies have documented ancient hybridization in a diverse array of taxa including mammals, birds, fish, fungi, and insects. Evidence for adaptive introgression is being documented in an increasing number of systems, though demonstrating the adaptive function of introgressed genomic regions remains difficult. And finally, several new homoploid hybrid speciation events have been reported. Here we review the current state of the field and specifically evaluate the additional insights gained from having access to whole-genome data and the challenges that remain with respect to understanding the evolutionary relevance and frequency of ancient hybridization, adaptive introgression, and hybrid speciation in nature.	2019	10.1038/s41559-018-0777-y		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Introgression of resistance (R) genes/quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from the Solanum germplasm into common potato is one of the plausible approaches to breed resistant cultivars. Although the conventional method of breeding will continue to play a primary role in potato improvement, molecular marker technology is becoming one of its integral components. To achieve rapid success, from the past to recent years, several R genes/QTLs that originated from wild/cultivated Solanum species were mapped on the potato genome and a few genes were cloned using molecular approaches. As a result, molecular markers closely linked to resistance genes or QTLs offer a quicker potato breeding option through marker-assisted selection (MAS). However, limited progress has been achieved so far through MAS in potato breeding. In near future, new resistance genes/QTLs are expected to be discovered from wild Solanum gene pools and linked molecular markers would be available for MAS. This article presents an update on the development of molecular markers linked to late blight resistance genes or QTLs by utilization of Solanum species for MAS in potato.	2013	10.1111/pbr.12053		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Toews, David P. L.; Brelsford, Alan	The biogeography of mitochondrial and nuclear discordance in animals	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Combining nuclear (nuDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers has improved the power of molecular data to test phylogenetic and phylogeographic hypotheses and has highlighted the limitations of studies using only mtDNA markers. In fact, in the past decade, many conflicting geographic patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers have been identified (i.e. mito-nuclear discordance). Our goals in this synthesis are to: (i) review known cases of mito-nuclear discordance in animal systems, (ii) to summarize the biogeographic patterns in each instance and (iii) to identify common drivers of discordance in various groups. In total, we identified 126 cases in animal systems with strong evidence of discordance between the biogeographic patterns obtained from mitochondrial DNA and those observed in the nuclear genome. In most cases, these patterns are attributed to adaptive introgression of mtDNA, demographic disparities and sex-biased asymmetries, with some studies also implicating hybrid zone movement, human introductions and Wolbachia infection in insects. We also discuss situations where divergent mtDNA clades seem to have arisen in the absence of geographic isolation. For those cases where foreign mtDNA haplotypes are found deep within the range of a second taxon, data suggest that those mtDNA haplotypes are more likely to be at a high frequency and are commonly driven by sex-biased asymmetries and/or adaptive introgression. In addition, we discuss the problems with inferring the processes causing discordance from biogeographic patterns that are common in many studies. In many cases, authors presented more than one explanation for discordant patterns in a given system, which indicates that likely more data are required. Ideally, to resolve this issue, we see important future work shifting focus from documenting the prevalence of mito-nuclear discordance towards testing hypotheses regarding the drivers of discordance. Indeed, there is great potential for certain cases of mitochondrial introgression to become important natural systems within which to test the effect of different mitochondrial genotypes on whole-animal phenotypes.	2012	10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05664.x		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Venske, Eduardo; dos Santos, Railson Schreinert; Busanello, Carlos; Gustafson, Perry; de Oliveira, Antonio Costa	Bread wheat: a role model for plant domestication and breeding	HEREDITAS	BackgroundBread wheat is one of the most important crops in the world. Its domestication coincides with the beginning of agriculture and since then, it has been constantly under selection by humans. Its breeding has followed millennia of cultivation, sometimes with unintended selection on adaptive traits, and later by applying intentional but empirical selective pressures. For more than one century, wheat breeding has been based on science, and has been constantly evolving due to on farm agronomy and breeding program improvements. The aim of this work is to briefly review wheat breeding, with emphasis on the current advances.DiscussionImproving yield potential, resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and baking quality, have been priorities for breeding this cereal, however, new objectives are arising, such as biofortification enhancement. The narrow genetic diversity and complexity of its genome have hampered the breeding progress and the application of biotechnology. Old approaches, such as the introgression from relative species, mutagenesis, and hybrid breeding are strongly reappearing, motivated by an accumulation of knowledge and new technologies. A revolution has taken place regarding the use of molecular markers whereby thousands of plants can be routinely genotyped for thousands of loci. After 13years, the wheat reference genome sequence and annotation has finally been completed, and is currently available to the scientific community. Transgenics, an unusual approach for wheat improvement, still represents a potential tool, however it is being replaced by gene editing, whose technology along with genomic selection, speed breeding, and high-throughput phenotyping make up the most recent frontiers for future wheat improvement.Final considerationAgriculture and plant breeding are constantly evolving, wheat has played a major role in these processes and will continue through decades to come.	2019	10.1186/s41065-019-0093-9		Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

The recent proliferation of genome-scale analyses has revealed two further general observations: (a) complex speciation involving some form of gene flow is not uncommon, and (b) sex chromosomes in male- and in female-heterogametic taxa tend to show elevated differentiation relative to autosomes. Together, these observations are consistent with speciation histories in which population genetic differentiation at autosomal loci is reduced by gene flow while natural selection against hybrid incompatibilities renders sex chromosomes relatively refractory to gene flow. Here, I summarize multilocus population genetic and population genomic evidence for greater differentiation on the X (or Z) vs. the autosomes and consider the possible causes. I review common population genetic circumstances involving no selection and/or no interspecific gene flow that are nevertheless expected to elevate differentiation on sex chromosomes relative to autosomes. I then review theory for why large X-effects exist for hybrid incompatibilities and, more generally, for loci mediating local adaptation. The observed levels of sex chromosome vs. autosomal differentiation, in many cases, appear consistent with simple explanations requiring neither large X-effects nor gene flow. Discerning signatures of large X-effects during complex speciation will therefore require analyses that go beyond chromosome-scale summaries of population genetic differentiation, explicitly test for differential introgression, and/or integrate experimental genetic data.	2018	10.1111/mec.14777		Review (sex chromosomes & Introgression!)

BACK TO THE WILDS: TAPPING EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS FOR RESILIENT CROPS THROUGH SYSTEMATIC HYBRIDIZATION WITH CROP WILD RELATIVES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY	The genetic diversity of our crop plants has been substantially reduced during the process of domestication and breeding. This reduction in diversity necessarily constrains our ability to expand a crop's range of cultivation into environments that are more extreme than those in which it was domesticated, including into "sustainable" agricultural systems with reduced inputs of pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Conversely, the wild progenitors of crop plants typically possess high levels of genetic diversity, which underlie an expanded (relative to domesticates) range of adaptive traits that may be of agricultural relevance, including resistance to pests and pathogens, tolerance to abiotic extremes, and reduced dependence on inputs. Despite their clear potential for crop improvement, wild relatives have rarely been used systematically for crop improvement, and in no cases, have full sets of wild diversity been introgressed into a crop. Instead, most breeding efforts have focused on specific traits and dealt with wild species in a limited and typically ad hoc manner. Although expedient, this approach misses the opportunity to test a large suite of traits and deploy the full potential of crop wild relatives in breeding for the looming challenges of the 21st century. Here we review examples of hybridization in several species, both intentionally produced and naturally occurring, to illustrate the gains that are possible. We start with naturally occurring hybrids, and then examine a range of examples of hybridization in agricultural settings.	2014	10.3732/ajb.1400116		Review; domestic crop/wild relatives			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Hybridization and speciation	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation. Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the DobzhanskyMuller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.	2013	10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02599.x		Review; useful			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Kishii, Masahiro	An Update of Recent Use of Aegilops Species in Wheat Breeding	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE	Aegilops species have significantly contributed to wheat breeding despite the difficulties involved in the handling of wild species, such as crossability and incompatibility. A number of biotic resistance genes have been identified and incorporated into wheat varieties from Aegilops species, and this genus is also contributing toward improvement of complex traits such as yield and abiotic tolerance for drought and heat. The D genome diploid species of Aegilops tauschii has been utilized most often in wheat breeding programs. Other Aegilops species are more difficult to utilize in the breeding because of lower meiotic recombination frequencies; generally they can be utilized only after extensive and time-consuming procedures in the form of translocation/introgression lines. After the emergence of Ug99 stem rust and wheat blast threats, Aegilops species gathered more attention as a form of new resistance sources. This article aims to update recent progress on Aegilops species, as well as to cover new topics around their use in wheat breeding.	2019	10.3389/fpls.2019.00585		Review/Opinion			TRUE	TRUE		FALSE			FALSE	
Martin, Simon H.; Jiggins, Chris D.	Interpreting the genomic landscape of introgression	CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT	Introgression, the transfer of genetic material between species through hybridisation, occurs in many taxa and has important consequences. Genomic studies allow us to characterise the landscape of introgression across the genome, shedding light on both its adaptive benefits and the incompatibilities that help to maintain species barriers. Studies taking a genome-wide view suggest that adaptive introgression may be common, but that introgressed variation between many species is selected against throughout much of the genome. Confounding factors can complicate interpretations from these data, and computational simulations have proved vital to illustrate expected patterns under different scenarios. Future developments will move beyond correlative evidence to explicit models that account for how selection and genetic drift influence introgressed variation.	2017	10.1016/j.gde.2017.08.007		Review/Opinion (relevant)			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Tung, Jenny; Barreiro, Luis B.	The contribution of admixture to primate evolution	CURRENT OPINION IN GENETICS & DEVELOPMENT	Genome-wide data on genetic variation are now available for multiple primate species and populations, facilitating analyses of evolutionary history within and across taxa. One emerging theme from these studies involves the central role of admixture. Genomic data sets indicate that both ancient gene flow following initial taxonomic divergence and ongoing gene flow at current species boundaries are common. These findings are of particular interest given evidence for a complex history of admixture in our own lineage, including examples of ecologically driven adaptive introgression. Like other aspects of human biology, studies of nonhuman primates thus provide both comparative context and a living model for understanding admixture dynamics in hominins. We highlight several open questions that could be addressed in future work.	2017	10.1016/j.gde.2017.08.010		Review/Opinion (relevant)			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Harrison, Richard G.; Larson, Erica L.	Heterogeneous genome divergence, differential introgression, and the origin and structure of hybrid zones	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybrid zones have been promoted as windows on the evolutionary process and as laboratories for studying divergence and speciation. Patterns of divergence between hybridizing species can now be characterized on a genomewide scale, and recent genome scans have focused on the presence of 'islands' of divergence. Patterns of heterogeneous genomic divergence may reflect differential introgression following secondary contact and provide insights into which genome regions contribute to local adaptation, hybrid unfitness and positive assortative mating. However, heterogeneous genome divergence can also arise in the absence of any gene flow, as a result of variation in selection and recombination across the genome. We suggest that to understand hybrid zone origins and dynamics, it is essential to distinguish between genome regions that are divergent between pure parental populations and regions that show restricted introgression where these populations interact in hybrid zones. The latter, more so than the former, reveal the likely genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. Mosaic hybrid zones, because of their complex structure and multiple contacts, are particularly good subjects for distinguishing primary intergradation from secondary contact. Comparisons among independent hybrid zones or transects that involve the 'same' species pair can also help to distinguish between divergence with gene flow and secondary contact. However, data from replicate hybrid zones or replicate transects do not reveal consistent patterns; in a few cases, patterns of introgression are similar across independent transects, but for many taxa, there is distinct lack of concordance, presumably due to variation in environmental context and/ or variation in the genetics of the interacting populations.	2016	10.1111/mec.13582		Review/Perspective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Payseur, Bret A.; Rieseberg, Loren H.	A genomic perspective on hybridization and speciation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Hybridization among diverging lineages is common in nature. Genomic data provide a special opportunity to characterize the history of hybridization and the genetic basis of speciation. We review existing methods and empirical studies to identify recent advances in the genomics of hybridization, as well as issues that need to be addressed. Notable progress has been made in the development of methods for detecting hybridization and inferring individual ancestries. However, few approaches reconstruct the magnitude and timing of gene flow, estimate the fitness of hybrids or incorporate knowledge of recombination rate. Empirical studies indicate that the genomic consequences of hybridization are complex, including a highly heterogeneous landscape of differentiation. Inferred characteristics of hybridization differ substantially among species groups. Loci showing unusual patterns - which may contribute to reproductive barriers - are usually scattered throughout the genome, with potential enrichment in sex chromosomes and regions of reduced recombination. We caution against the growing trend of interpreting genomic variation in summary statistics across genomes as evidence of differential gene flow. We argue that converting genomic patterns into useful inferences about hybridization will ultimately require models and methods that directly incorporate key ingredients of speciation, including the dynamic nature of gene flow, selection acting in hybrid populations and recombination rate variation.	2016	10.1111/mec.13557		Review/Perspective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Wayne, Robert K.; Shaffer, H. Bradley	Hybridization and endangered species protection in the molecular era	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	After decades of discussion, there is little consensus on the extent to which hybrids between endangered and nonendangered species should be protected by US law. As increasingly larger, genome-scale data sets are developed, we can identify individuals and populations with even trace levels of genetic admixture, making the 'hybrid problem' all the more difficult. We developed a decision-tree framework for evaluating hybrid protection, including both the processes that produced hybrids (human-mediated or natural) and the ecological impact of hybrids on natural ecosystems. We then evaluated our decision tree for four case studies drawn from our own work and briefly discuss several other cases from the literature. Throughout, we highlight the management outcomes that our approach provides and the nuances of hybridization as a conservation problem.	2016	10.1111/mec.13642		Review/Perspective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Hamilton, Jill A.; Miller, Joshua M.	From transects to transcripts: Teasing apart the architecture of reproductive isolation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	Understanding the processes underlying speciation has long been a challenge to evolutionary biologists. This spurs from difficulties teasing apart the various mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of barriers to reproduction. The study by Rafati et al. (2018) in this issue of Molecular Ecology combines spatially explicit whole-genome resequencing with evaluation of differential gene expression across individuals with mixed ancestry to associate the genomic architecture of reproductive barriers with expression of reproductive incompatibilities. In a natural hybrid zone between rabbit subspecies, Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus and O. c. algirus (Figure 1), Rafati et al. (2018) use landscape-level patterns of allele frequency variation to identify potential candidate regions of the genome associated with reproductive isolation. These candidate regions are used to test predictions associated with the genomic architecture of reproductive barriers, including the role of structural rearrangements, enrichment of functional categories associated with incompatibilities, and the contribution of protein-coding versus regulatory changes. A lack of structural rearrangements and limited protein-coding changes in candidate regions point towards the importance of regulatory variation as major contributors to genetic incompatibilities, while functional enrichments indicate overrepresentation of genes associated with male infertility. To quantify phenotypic expression of proposed incompatibilities, the authors assess gene expression of experimental crosses. Extensive misregulation of gene expression within the testes of backcross hybrids relative to F1 and parental individuals provides an important link between genotype and phenotype, validating hypotheses developed from assessment of genomic architectures. Together, this work shows how pairing natural hybrid zones with experimental crosses can be used to link observations in nature to mechanistic underpinnings that may be tested experimentally.	2018	10.1111/mec.14516		Review/prospective			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Hill, Geoffrey E.	The mitonuclear compatibility species concept	AUK	The avian world is packaged into genetic assemblages that we call species. Although ornithologists can, with a few important exceptions, agree on the boundaries among avian gene pools that delimit species, the evolutionary process that created this structured subdivision of Aves remains uncertain and contentious. Moreover, although avian species are recognizable and diagnosable, many bear signatures of recent, often substantial, exchange of nuclear (N) genetic material. As a result, there is debate regarding the process that gives rise to and maintains the genetic structure of avian populations. I propose that a key missing consideration in discussions of speciation is the necessity of coadaptation between N and mitochondrial (mt) genes to enable core energy production via oxidative phosphorylation. Because mt genomes are non-recombining and subject to high mutation rates, they evolve rapidly. Consequently, N and mt coadaptation persists only through perpetual coevolution between mt and N genes. Mitonuclear coevolution leads to rapid divergences in coadapted mitonuclear gene sets whenever there is a disruption in gene flow among populations. As a result, once populations diverge in coadapted mitonuclear genotypes, the reduced fitness of offspring due to mitonuclear incompatibilities prohibits exchange of mt and N-mt genes and effectively isolates individuals with shared coadapted N and mt genotypes. Given these considerations, I propose that avian species can be objectively diagnosed by uniquely coadapted mt and N genotypes that are incompatible with the coadapted mt and N genotype of any other population. According to this mitonuclear compatibility species concept, mitochondrial genotype is the best current method for diagnosing species.	2017	10.1642/AUK-16-201.1		Review/theory; reference to birds			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Cannon, Charles H.; Scher, C. Lane	Exploring the potential of gametic reconstruction of parental genotypes by F-1 hybrids as a bridge for rapid introgression	GENOME	Interspecific hybridization and genetic introgression are commonly observed in natural populations of many species, especially trees. Among oaks, gene flow between closely related species has been well documented. And yet, hybridization does not lead to a "melting pot", i.e., the homogenization of phenotypic traits. Here, we explore how the combination of several common reproductive and genomic traits could create an avenue for interspecific gene flow that partially explains this apparent paradox. During meiosis, F-1 hybrids will produce approximately (1/2)(n) "reconstructed" parental gametes, where n equals the number of chromosomes. Crossing over would introduce a small amount of introgressive material. The resulting parental-type gametophytes would probably possess a similar fertilization advantage as conspecific pollen. The resulting "backcross" would actually be the genetic equivalent of a conspecific out-cross, with a small amount of heterospecific DNA captured through crossing over. Even with detailed genomic analysis, the resulting offspring would not appear to be a backcross. This avenue for rapid introgression between species through the F1 hybrid will be viable for organisms that meet certain conditions: low base chromosome number, conserved genomic structure and size, production of billions of gametes/gametophytes during each reproductive event, and conspecific fertilization advantage.	2017	10.1139/gen-2016-0181		Review/Theory; reference to plants			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Ackermann, Rebecca Rogers; Mackay, Alex; Arnold, Michael L.	The Hybrid Origin of "Modern" Humans	EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Recent genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in human evolution. However, the importance of hybridization in shaping the genotype and phenotype of Homo sapiens remains debated. Here we argue that current evidence for hybridization in human evolution suggests not only that it was important, but that it was an essential creative force in the emergence of our variable, adaptable species. We then extend this argument to a reappraisal of the archaeological record, proposing that the exchange of cultural information between divergent groups may have facilitated the emergence of cultural innovation. We discuss the implications of this Divergence and Hybridization Model for considering the taxonomy of our lineage.	2016	10.1007/s11692-015-9348-1		Synthesis/Review			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Lindtke, Dorothea; Buerkle, C. Alex	The genetic architecture of hybrid incompatibilities and their effect on barriers to introgression in secondary contact	EVOLUTION	Genetic incompatibilities are an important component of reproductive isolation. Although theoretical studies have addressed their evolution, little is known about their maintenance when challenged by potentially high migration rates in secondary contact. Although theory predicts that recombination can erode barriers, many empirical systems have been found to retain species-specific differences despite substantial gene flow. By simulating whole genomes in individuals of hybridizing species, we find that the genetic architecture of two contrasting models of epistatic hybrid incompatibilities and the context of hybridization can substantially affect species integrity and genomic heterogeneity. In line with theory, our results show that intergenomic incompatibilities break down rapidly by recombination, but can maintain genome-wide differentiation under very limited conditions. By contrast, intragenomic interactions that arise from genetic pathways can maintain species-specific differences even with high migration rates and gene flow, whereas introgression at large parts of the genome can simultaneously remain extensive, consistent with empirical observations. We discuss the importance of intragenomic interactions in speciation and consider how this form of epistatic fitness variation is implicated and supported by other theoretical and empirical studies. We further address the relevance of replicates and knowledge of context when investigating the genomics of speciation.	2015	10.1111/evo.12725		Theoretical 			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE	
Muirhead, Christina A.; Presgraves, Daven C.	Hybrid Incompatibilities, Local Adaptation, and the Genomic Distribution of Natural Introgression between Species	AMERICAN NATURALIST	Under allopatric speciation, geographic barriers eliminate gene flow between eventual species at all loci in the genome simultaneously. There is increasing evidence, however, that speciation can be complex, with some loci experiencing gene flow during speciation or during bouts of secondary contact. In taxa with heteromorphic sex chromosomes-birds, butterflies, mammals, and Drosophila-the X (or Z) chromosome generally shows reduced levels of gene flow compared to autosomes. To investigate why, we develop population genetic models of secondary contact and gene flow at a neutral locus that is genetically linked to selected loci involved in hybrid incompatibilities and/or local adaptation. Using models that assume weak migration and strong selection, we compare gene flow at X-linked versus autosomal neutral loci as a function of linkage, dominance, sex-specific selection, and sex-specific recombination. For most cases, gene flow at neutral loci on the X is reduced relative to autosomes, as the greater efficacy of hemizygous selection in XY hybrids reduces the opportunity for neutral migrant alleles to escape their genetically linked, locally disfavored alleles via recombination. There are some circumstances, however, involving sex-limited selection and sex-limited recombination that allow neutral loci on the X to introgress more readily than those on autosomes.	2016	10.1086/684583		Theory			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE

Kanchana-udomkan, C.; Razean, M. R.; Drew, R.; Peace, C.	Developing DNA Markers for a Wild Source of Resistance to Papaya Ringspot Virus	III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MOLECULAR MARKERS IN HORTICULTURE	Production of papaya (Carica papaya) is limited throughout its growing regions by the devastating disease of Papaya Ringspot Virus type P (PRSV-P). Papaya breeding programmes for PRSV-P resistance target two sources of resistance from crop wild relatives. The resistance loci from V. pubescens were identified in a segregating population resulting from an interspecific cross between V. pubescens and V. parviflora. The resistance loci in V. pubescens were located on supercontig (SC) 28 of the papaya whole genome sequence although SC28 is not yet anchored to any linkage group (LG). Recent investigations indicate that SC28 could be located at the end of LG5. Another species V. quercifolia also carries PRSV-P resistance, although more quantitative in action, and this species produces some fertile hybrids when crossed to C. papaya. The aim of this study was to target polymorphism at the end of LG5 and on SC28 in C. papaya and V. quercifolia. Five candidate resistant genes were used, corresponding to three nucleotide binding sites (NBS; NBS9.305, NBS9.308 and NBS18.235) at the end of LG5 and one NBS (NBS28.12) and one kinase gene (STK105) on SC28. Primers were designed for each gene and used to amplify DNA of papaya variety '2.001' and an accession of V. quercifolia. Resultant DNA sequences were aligned by BLASTN to the papaya whole genome sequence, indicating 98-100% and 89-99% identities for the '2.001' and V. quercifolia amplicons, respectively, and 82-93% identity between these two species.	2015			Virus			FALSE	FALSE		FALSE			FALSE
