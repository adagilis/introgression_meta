# introgression_meta_biorxiv
Scripts and data for preprint version of "15 years of introgression studies: quantifying gene flow across Eukaryotes". This version has not undergone peer review, so cite at your own risk.

Scripts are avaialable as an RMD file (meta_analysis.Rmd), the remainder are helper files. List of papers with evidence for introgression (SupFile1_PaperList.tsv) was curated manually. Separate files for broad taxonomic grouping f statistics are provided. Unpack distances.tgz for pre-calculated reciprocal best hit genetic distances.
